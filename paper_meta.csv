0	320571	Other	Mapping Alternations caused by Hydrocarbon Microseepages in Patrick Draw Area, Southwest Wyoming, Using Image Spectroscopy and Hyperspectral Remote Sensing	Shuhab Khan, U. of HustonDaniel Ferguson, NETL									Final Project Summary -DE-FG26-05NT42494-Results from the Hyperion hyperspectral remote sensing work at the Patrick Draw oilfield in southwest Wyoming demonstrates a successful application of hyperspectral mapping techniques when applied to the identification of subtle geochemical alterations associated with hydrocarbon microseepage. These results are confirmed by geochemical work		National Energy Technology Laboratory
1	320572	Other	Novel Use of P-wave and S-wave Seismic Attenuation for Deep Natural Gas Exploration and Development	Joel Walls, RSIFran Toro, NETL									Final Project Summary - DE-FC26-04NT42243- Goal: To develop and test a new methodology for using seismic attenuation(Q) attributes, from multi-component P-wave and S-wave seismic data, for assessing the presence of high oil or natural gas saturations, and estimating reservoir properties (in particular, gas saturation, lithology, and porosity).		National Energy Technology Laboratory
2	320573	Other	Production of Natural Gas and Fluid Flow in Tight Sand Reservoirs	Dr. Maria Brazo, FIUTom Mroz, NETL									Final Project Summary - DE-FG26-04NT42132 -The main goal of this research is to identify possible relationships and define dependencies between macroscopic reservoir parameters strongly affected by microscopic flow dynamics and production well performance in tight-gas sand reservoirs.		National Energy Technology Laboratory
3	320574	Other	Expanding Conventional Seismic Stratigraphy into the Multicomponent Seismic Domain	Innocent J. Aluka, Prairie View A MJesse Garcia, NETL									Final Project Summary-DE-FG26-04NT42131-This project is intended to expand the science of seismic stratigraphy into a new seismic interpretation technology that could influence worldwide seismic operations for a long time. With such technology, stratigraphers will realize that it is necessary to include all seismic modes into sequence and facies analyses to fully define depositional architecture across critical intervals		National Energy Technology Laboratory
4	320575	Other	Alaska North Slope Oil and Gas Resources Assessment	Charles Thomas, SAICBrent Sheets, NETL									Final Project Summary-DE-AC26-04NT41817-The project goal is to provide a detailed assessment and analysis of Alaska North Slope (ANS) oil and gas resources and the interrelated technical, economic, and environmental factors controlling the development of those resources		National Energy Technology Laboratory
5	320576	Other	Customizable Fuzzy Expert System for Regional and Local Play Analysis	Robert Balch, PRRCRhonda Jacobs, NETL									Final Project Summary-DE-FC26-04NT15512-The objective of this project is to create a user-definable and customizable fuzzy expert system tool to dramatically speed local and regional play analysis and reduce subsequent drilling risk		National Energy Technology Laboratory
