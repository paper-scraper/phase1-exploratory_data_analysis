Driskill(Doyon Drilling Inc.)|Ron Wilson(Doyon Drilling Inc.)|Vernon Troy Johnson(Sperry-Sun Drilling Services)|Raymond Brett Chandler(Grant Prideco Inc.),,,,,,SPE-100628-MS,"SPE Western Regional/AAPG Pacific Section/GSA Cordilleran Section Joint Meeting, 8-10 May, Anchorage, Alaska, USA",2006,"The trend to drill deeper and longer extended reach wells with long, slim-hole 6-1/8 in. horizontal production intervals has revealed serious limitations in the standard 3-1/2 in. drill pipe conventionally used in these applications. ConocoPhillips realized significant drilling performance and economic benefits by utilizing 4 in. drill pipe with advanced design, slim-hole connections in place of standard 3-1/2 in. drill pipe. The streamline drill pipe design configuration resulted in successful drilling of longer slim-hole intervals with enhanced torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulic performance at a lower overall cost.IntroductionConocoPhillips' Alpine field on the western North Slope of Alaska required Extended Reach Drilling to deliver pay zone objectives located at measured depths between 8,800 ft and 21,200 ft with lateral lengths up to 7,830 ft MD. Complex 3-dimensional paths are employed in the field often resulting in tortuosity considerations and associated elevated torsional and compressive load requirements for the drill string. ConocoPhillips wanted a drill string design that could deliver higher torsional capacity and improved hydraulic performance to enhance drilling efficiencies and lower operational times and costs. The slim-hole 4 in. drill string design permitted use of the same drill bit/casing program as employed previously with conventional 3-1/2 in. pipe.A high performance, double shoulder connection for 4 in. drill pipe was selected that maintained a tool joint outside diameter similar to conventional 3-1/2 in. drill pipe tool joints. This streamline connection maintains fishing ability in both cased and open hole sections while providing enhanced torsional strength. Other major drilling improvements realized include: higher buckling resistance, more available pressure at the bit, lower standpipe pressure, improved hole cleaning and higher penetration rates. In addition, the 4 in. high-performance drill pipe was suitable for drilling larger diameter intermediate hole sections eliminating a requirement for 5 in. drill pipe. This drastically reduced the amount of time spent picking up and laying down drill strings, resulting in reduced HSE exposure handling drill pipe.This paper addresses these considerations and provides case histories that clearly illustrate the benefits, savings and limitations that can be achieved with this new drill pipe design configuration.Alpine Development OverviewAs mentioned above the Alpine field is located on the western North Slope of Alaska, see Figure 1. The field has no paved road access; annual ice road access is generally available from approximately the middle of February through May. Recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 429 million for the field. The current production rate is approximately 129M BOPD.The drilling sites consist of two pads connected by a gravel road. The wells include injectors and producers drilled on a one to one ratio. All the wells, both producer and injector, must be drilled from the twp pads that contain surface templates with well slots on 10 ft spacing, center to center.

Its purpose is to develop and suggest the principles and factors that should be considered and applied in allocating production between tracts in restricted pools, It is realized that producing reservoirs vary from each other; nevertheless, it is believed all are sufficiently similar to render possible the application of certain general fundamental principles. This is merely a progress report. It is yet only tentative, and presents the majority opinion of the topical committee as developed to date. It has not been submitted to the governing body of the Institute. Suggestions and comments are invited. It is supplemented by papers prepared by individual committee members, discussing in some detail the more essential features contained herein.AIMSPrimary consideration should be given to the appropriate balancing of the following general aims:Maximum economic recovery of oil from each pool should be obtained.Equity should be maintained between the productive tracts.PROBLEMWhen a pool is producing without restriction, lease operations are under the control of the operators who may produce as they please to protect their interests. We are not now concerned in this report with whether, irrespective of waste, the courts or the legislature should undertake to regulate production to protect the property rights of each producer. Proration certainly limits this right of self-protection. A sound allocation plan, a t least to a fair degree, must substitute protection for the curtailment it imposes upon individual enterprise. The problem is to determine the nature of the protection and the method of its application to balance properly maximum economic recovery and equity.APPROACHBefore the advent of restriction, and according to some of the legal decisions and in view of the facts proved or assumed therein, an operator protected his lease when he offset his neighbors' wells and produced his oil as his judgment might guide him. This method of protection is not available when restriction is imposed. The committee has developed principles and factors which, when applied to a restricted pool, probably per- Init operators involved to enjoy approximately the same degree of participation in production from the pool as would have resulted by prudent and diligent operation under unrestricted flow-with probably greater protection from drainage and damage from neighboring leases. The distribution of the oil is also affected to some extent, as curtailment may modify degree of water encroachment, expansion of gas cap, and relation between oil and gas production under a program of conservation of reservoir energy. Equity between tracts in a restricted pool can be procured by assigning to each tract an allowable which bears the same relationship to the total allowable of the pool as the reserves under that tract, recoverable by applying the principles and factors outlined in this report, bear to the reserves of the pool as a whole recoverable under the same conditions.",,American Petroleum Institute

FPSOs are new built .tankers. or modified existing .tankers.. Cathodic protection of an FPSO is in most cases based on IC and designed according to .ship standards.. One significant operational difference between a ship and an FPSO is that a ship is in dock each 3 to 5 years for repair of coating etc. An FPSO is in operation for typically 15 to 30 years, with no coating repair. This will result in a major increase in the current requirements from launch to the end of operational life. The number of IC anodes is in most cases too few and the size of shielding around anodes is too small. CP modeling has shown that this may result in both significant over protection and at the same time under protection. CP modeling has shown to be an excellent tool for optimizing anode number, positions and shielding size.INTRODUCTIONFloating production units are more and more used in the offshore industry. An FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) unit is one of those. Many of these systems are converted tankers, or are new build ship based on modified tankers.The corrosion protection externally for these units is often based on a coating system and cathodic protection. Impressed Current (IC) has by far been the most common system for the FPSOs, which also has been widely used within the shipping industry.For the regular shipping industry the ships will go in to dry dock a minimum of every 5 years, for maintenance purpose. This allows for repair of coating system, shielding and anodes systems. This essential maintenance will provide a coating system with low percentage coating breakdown and thereby a relatively low current output from the IC system.If standard ship solutions are selected the number of anodes is low (4 to 8) with a relatively small shielding around the IC anodes.FPSO can be in operation for even more than 30 years. Within this period, there will be no docking and the coating system will degrade more or less according to the design figures. In order to evaluate the development of the IC performance, CP computer modeling has been used to evaluate several scenarios for the different FPSOs.",,NACE International
166,320731,,Acreage and Sand Thickness as Factors In Proration,M. Albertson(Shell Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-34-012,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"DefinitionsThe purpose of this paper is to define the true position of acreage and sand thickness as factors in the proration of oil and gas. To do this, it is first necessary to understand what proration is. Webster's dictionary states that the word ''prorate is derived from the Latin words pro rata The following definitions are of interest: Pro rata is defined as: According to a certain part, in proportion, proportionally; according to share, interest, or liability of each. Prorate is defined as: To divide or distribute proportionally; to assess pro rata. Proration? is defined as: The act of or an instance of proration. In each case the definitions are quoted directly from Webster's unabridged dictionary. The meanings given are the only ones given by Webster for the three words referred to.The proper meaning of the word proration is thus established. It means the act of or an instance of dividing or distributing proportionately. This proportionate division of the allowable oil production is what nearly all of us have had in mind as a fair method of allocation in the production of oil and gas. While this proportionate, fair or equitable, division of the consumer demand has been the allocation desired, the result in most so-called proration plans has been something quite different.The purpose of this paper also requires an understanding as to the reasons for the proration of oil and gas production. The primary reason for proration is the need for limiting the amount produced so that it equals consumer demand. An additional and closely related reason for proration is the need to prevent waste. In view of the meaning of the word ?proration, and the desirability of proration in oil and gas production, it is clear that any limitation of production which is not made proportional to the share, or interest, of producers is not proration at all. Unless the restriction is made proportional to each operator's interest in producing property, it simply is not proration.Standard of MeasuresSince proration must be proportional to share, or interest, it is clear that the size of the various shares, or interests must be measured either absolutely or relatively. This is necessary in order to establish the proportionate share of the allowable for each operator. What standards must be used in measuring these shares or interests? It is assumed that this must be done in accordance with the factors which determined values at the time restriction of production began and prior thereto. The guiding principles come from the experience of the industry before proration. Thus the share, or interest, or the factors determining such share or interest, which any operator was assured of when the industry operated without restraint as to number of wells drilled, or as to rate of production, becomes the true measure of his proration allowance. If these cannot be fixed in detail-and it must be conceded that they cannot-there is much to recommend that the average result of such method of operation be taken as the new standard of values.",,American Petroleum Institute
167,320732,,The Potential or Productivity Factor in Allocation Formulas,R.B. Kelly(The Pure Oil Co.),,,,,,API-34-015,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"The potential or productivity factor for proration purposes will continue to cost the oil industry millions of dollars each year, and result in gross inequities, unless extreme caution is exercised in the methods employed in obtaining and applying it. Condemned in its usual form of open flow by practically all engineers as being inaccurate, wasteful, and dangerous, its use, nevertheless, is being forced upon good and poor operators alike. Such action, reinforced as it is by court decisions, is likely to continue unless the responsible and thinking part of the industry presents a satisfactory substitute. The statute under which proration is applied in Oklahoma at this time specifically states that allocations in a single pool must be made in relation to the potentials of the individual wells. A recent decision handed down by the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that restricted or choked potentials were not acceptable, and that the tests must be made under full open-flow conditions. This method of obtaining potentials in the Oklahoma City pool is estimated to have cost the operators in that field no less than ten million dollars for over-sized equipment, such as casing, Christmas trees, separators, tanks, etc. Had some other productivity factor been used, this needless expenditure could have been avoided. During the past 12 months three-judge federal courts in Texas have indicated very clearly that individual well potentials must constitute a part of the proration plan if it is to withstand court attacks. Operators in two of the largest oil-producing states, therefore, find themselves confronted with the necessity of either accepting the antiquated open-flow-potential idea or of offering a substitute which will accomplish the same purpose. Accepting the fact that the ability of a well to yield oil is one of the factors which must be considered in an equitable proration program, the Committee on Allocation of Production proposes that the index be obtained in some manner other than open flow. There are perhaps two alternatives which are practical and applicable to the problem at this time.Restricted flow :Through tubing.Through tubing with choke.Differential bottom-hole pressure tests.Restricted Flow through TubingPotential tests obtained through tubing of sufficient diameter to indicate the relation between the tubing and casing flow offer some advantages over the open-flow tests. This method has shown that wells completed with the same size flow strings and tubing have a relationship between rate of production through tubing and through both casing and tubing. By plotting this relationship on coordinate paper it has been found that a reasonably smooth curve might be drawn, and after certain refinements an average curve can be made. Corrections can also be made for wells exceeding the average gasoil ratio in the field. Revision of potentials is accomplished when desired by merely flowing wells wide open through the tubing for a specified period and obtaining the open-flow values from the average curve.Restricted Flow through Tubing with ChokeThe restricted-flow test through tubing and choke, while much less wasteful, detrimental, and expensive than the open-flow test, does not necessarily give true relative potentials.",,American Petroleum Institute

Wyckoff(Gulf Research and Development Corp.),,,,,,API-34-018,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"ForewordPrior to the time when proration was generally applied to hold oil production within reasonable limits, wells were operated at their full capacity, i. e., at 100 per cent of their open-flow potential. Clearly, such operation permits no deviation from the principle of the right of capture. In fact, from this mode of operation came the legal decisions setting the precedent for such a code-indeed no other interpretation and, hence, no other basic law predicated upon precedent was possible. It should be emphasized, therefore, that the so-called law of capture was derived not from any definition of equity in the usual sense, but rather represents the only interpretation possible under the operating methods in vogue during the early history of the industry.Operating methods have changed in recent years, first due to economic circumstances which no longer permit the unrestricted flow of wells and, finally, because of the experience gained in the operation of restricted fields, to recognition of the fact that unrestricted operation is not in accord with good engineering practice and is contrary to the principles of conservation. Governmentally enforced restriction, which necessarily requires the proration of production among the several operators in an individual field, has led to misunderstanding concerning the property rights of individual owners implied under existing petroleum laws. Furthermore, chiefly through the misapplication of the potential factor, together with failure to consider certain fundamental laws of behavior of oil reservoirs, allocation plans have been devised and enforced that distribute the oil in a manner entirely different from that which would have prevailed under the old unrestricted flow operation.In considering methods for the proper application of well potentials, sand permeability, and well pressures to the problems of allocation, it is necessary to understand clearly the equities of operators and property owners in oil fields as defined by the law. In the absence of the necessity to control production to reduce waste, the law under which the ,industry has operated from its beginning states that an owner is entitled to oil produced from wells on his property. The effect of this law under the old unrestricted production methods waste permit each operator to drill and produce from as many wells as, in his opinion, were required to obtain the recoverable oil under his land. The operator himself was responsible for the protection of this right. Thus the off-set rules in lease agreements came into existence, and the fact that these rules have been sustained in the courts is evidence that it was the courts' intention to give each operator the privilege of producing the recoverable oil underlying his property. It is true that under this rule all operators did not always produce only the recoverable oil under their property-a situation brought about by economic circumstances which did not permit the development of the field to a uniform well density. However, the legal right to do so did exist.",,American Petroleum Institute
169,320734,,Application of the Principle of Volumetric Withdrawal to the Allocation of Production,T.V. Moore(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-023,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"Introduction:Our petroleum resources, although apparently abundant at present are limited and irreplaceable, and any production method which brings about unreasonable waste of these resources is contrary to the public interest. At the same time, the property rights of the several owners in any field must be recognized; each owner should be given a reasonable opportunity to produce his share of the oil .in the field, and no operator should be permitted to produce oil on his property in such a manner as to affect adversely the property of his neighbor. These principles are reasonable and just, although the courts seem to be slow in recognizing them. Conservation of the native energy of an oil reservoir is the keystone of the arch which upholds both of these principles. Improper utilization of this energy inevitably results in a waste of recoverable oil, which is suffered not alone by those guilty of the wasteful practices, but by every property owner in the field. Recently a better understanding of the nature and function of reservoir energy has been obtained, and gas and water have been recognized as the media which furnish the energy which moves the oil from the sand beds in which it is found to the bores of the wells from which it may be recovered. Thus, engineers have recognized the fact that any production program which does not provide for adequate control of gas and water is undesirable, and that any operator who wastes large quantities of gas in order to produce a little oil is receiving a far larger share of the contents of the reservoir than his oil production alone would indicate. In order, to reduce the waste of recoverable oil and to protect the efficient producer against the inefficient practice of his neighbor, the principle of volumetric displacement has been developed-under which gas and water, as well as oil, are considered in allocating equitably the allowable production of the field. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this principle and the effect of its application, and to suggest methods by which it can be applied. For the purpose of demonstrating more clearly the value and necessity of controlling gas and water in oil fields, the function of these two fluids in the production of oil will be discussed briefly. In order to recover oil, it must be moved through the pores of the reservoir in which it is found to the wells. The oil will not move of its own accord; it must be driven to the wells by some force. The, forces which drive the oil through the sand in this manner may be: 1, the force of the compressed gas associated with the oil; 2, the force of the water under pressure which commonly underlies the oil; and, 3, the force of gravity, which is of such small magnitude that its effect is usually unimportant.",,American Petroleum Institute
170,320735,,Effect of Volumetric Withdrawal on Physical Waste in the Oklahoma City Field,D.R. Knowlton(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-34-028,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"Due to an unfortunate combination of natural conditions and state regulations, the Oklahoma City oil field has been produced in a manner which has resulted in large gas wastage and, consequently, rapid dissipation of reservoir pressures. The original reservoir pressure was approximately 2,600 Ib., and under that pressure the oil contained large volumes of gas in solution. This gas was principally methane; and, therefore, readily came out of solution when the pressure in the reservoir was reduced. Since few of the wells were tubed, and the production practice was to flow the wells intermittently through casing, very unequal pressures existed within the reservoir. This method of production has contributed to a large extent in forming the gas cap along the eastern edge of the Wilcox sand. This gas cap has been gradually increasing since the first well was drilled, at which time there was little or no gas cap apparent. The advance of this gas cap down dip has been very irregular; and, apparently, it shifts near the contact of the oil and free-gas area-causing wells to change from good oil wells to gas wells and back to oil wells again over short periods of time. This erratic condition is no doubt caused by the irregular production methods, the intermittent flowing of these large wells, and the unbalanced withdrawals from the reservoir. At the present time the gas cap is apparently holding its own, or possibly moving up dip in some areas.Gas Conservation and Reservoir PressureIn November 1931 a four-hour open-flow potential was taken on every well in the Wilcox zone. At that time the gas cap was relatively small, and in the newer part of the field had not started to form. The allowable production for the field was based on this potential until April 1933, or a period of 18 months, when a new four-hour open-flow test was again taken on all wells. During this 18 month period the gas cap was forming rapidly and extending down dip to include many wells' which in November 1931 were capable of making from 2,000 bbl. to 3,000 bbl of oil per hour. These same wells in April 1'933 were reduced in some instances to as low as 100 bbl. per hour, and the gas-oil ratio increased from 2,000 cu. ft. per bbl. in November 1931 to over 100,000 cu. ft. per bbl. in April 1933. Obviously,-the reservoir energy was being rapidly dissipated through' such wells because of their owners' attempt to produce the large oil allowable. The new potential in April 1933 corrected this condition by reducing greatly the oil allowable from these high-ratio wells. In the North Wilcox area sub-surface-pressure measurements and other data have been secured which are sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to permit a reasonably close estimate of the amount of gas produced with the oil. This information has been used to show graphically the effect of gas production on the reservoir pressures (see Fig. 1). The decided break in both the bottom-hole-pressure curve and the gas curve in May 1933 is due to the taking of new potentials in April.",,American Petroleum Institute
171,320736,,An Allocation Formula,H.D. Wilde Jr.(Humble and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-030,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"INTRODUCTIONAs pointed out by the chairman in his report, the committee has agreed upon a definition of equity between productive tracts in a prorated pool and upon the general principles to be observed in allocating the production of the pool between the various tracts in order that this equity may be achieved. While the committee was in session a sub-committee was appointed to work out the details of a definite formula for applying these principles. When the sub-committee reported back, the majority of the topical committee felt that, in the light of present-day knowledge, the formula proposed was as good a one as could be derived; but that, although a definite formula is greatly to be desired, present-day knowledge of the physics and mechanics of oil production is not certain enough to justify the unqualified recommendation of the proposed formula. However, in order to illustrate how the principles agreed upon might be incorporated in a formula, the committee requested the writer (who is not a member of the sub-committee) to prepare this paper presenting the formula proposed explaining its derivation, and showing how it applies the principles adopted. In undertaking the assignment the writer realizes that too many people the very idea of a formula is objectionable, recalling unhappy hours spent in school on mathematics. But if such people will only consider that, after all, a formula is merely a short-hand way of expressing a definite idea-showing what factors are considered, how they are related, and what weight is given to each of them-formulas should lose this unpleasant aspect. As a matter of convenience in a formula, the factors are expressed as symbols or letters instead of words and sentences. The formula is, therefore, a brief, concise way of writing down the rules and regulations by which the ends sought may be achieved. As pointed out in the report of the chairman, the committee believes equity in a prorated pool is attained when each tract is allowed to produce currently an amount of oil in proportion to the remaining recoverable reserves pertaining to the tract. In order to achieve this end the formula should include the productive area of the tract (which in the formula will be designated by the symbol A), the average net thickness of the producing formation underlying the tract (H), the relative current ability of the tract to produce oil through wells drilled on the tract (P), and the bottom-hole ,pressure of the tract (B). If the formula contains only these factors, there are likely to be specific cases in any field where the allowable fixed by the formula would be so small that the value of the oil produced would' be insufficient to pay the daily operation cost. This would lead to the premature abandonment of wells so affected-leaving in the ground appreciable quantities of recoverable oil, thus causing physical waste. To avoid this the formula should also contain a factor (M) that would insure an amount of oil sufficient to pay a reasonable lifting cost.",,American Petroleum Institute
172,320737,,The Effect of Curtailment on Ultimate Recovervy,T.V. Moore(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-035,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"Conservation or Curtailment?Is the program of curtailing petroleum production price fixing or conservation? The majority of responsible oil operators agree upon the answer; but even after four years of widespread authoritative curtailment some still ask this question. Attempts to fix the price of other commodities at unreasonably high values have, in the past, led to disaster. On the other hand, wasteful exploitation of natural resources has been proved more dangerous, and wisely administered conservation programs have always been profitable. If curtailment be price fixing, it is a hazardous experiment; while if it be conservation, it is indispensable to the welfare of the industry and the public. This paper presents a discussion of the effect of controlling production upon the waste of oil, primarily from the standpoint of the technical phases of the problem. However, the physical aspects affecting waste are so closely related to economic conditions that it is impossible to study this problem without consideration of the economic factors.Economic ProblemsThe petroleum industry faces numerous peculiar economic problems. Crude oil is not the only source of liquid fuel, although it is by far the cheapest. Thus, it appears that the purpose of conserving this resource is not to guarantee to the public a supply of motor fuel and lubricants, but rather to insure that these products will be available at reasonable prices. Unlike the majority of commodities, the consumption of petroleum products does not vary greatly with the price of crude I oil. This is due to two causes: 1, the cost of fuel is a comparatively small part (about one-third) of the cost of transportation; and, 2, the cost of fuel to the consumer is greatly magnified by exorbitant taxes on petroleum and its products. Thus, if the oil companies were to furnish without charge their services in discovering, producing, refining, transporting, and marketing oil, the consuming public would still have to pay, in various taxes, about half the present price for its gasoline. The price of crude oil is a relatively small component of the cost of transportation. The demand for gasoline depends largely upon the use of motor vehicles, which is not greatly affected by the price of petroleum products. Rather, it depends upon the cost of the motor vehicles, the general prosperity, the condition of the country's roads' and other similar factors. For these reasons, the consumption of petroleum products is not substantially increased by an over-supply of cheap, crude oil. It is obvious that any oil produced in excess of the current demand must go into storage or be diverted to inferior uses. In storage the oil soon loses its most valuable constituents by evaporation, and there is danger of complete destruction by fire. Any oil not stored must be used in some manner, usually in the form of fuel oil. Over-supply of crude oil forces refiners to convert a smaller fraction into gasoline, with a corresponding increase in the production of fuel oil. Fuel oil at very low prices can, temporarily at least, replace coal.",,American Petroleum Institute
173,320738,,Changes in Hvdrostatic Pressure Due to Withdrawing Drill Pipe from the Hole,George E. Cannon(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-041,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"It has been observed that most blow-outs in rotary drilling occur when the drill pipe is being withdrawn from the hole. This paper describes a series of tests which was conducted to determine the factors which affect the magnitude of the pressure drop which occurs when the drill pipe is withdrawn from the hole. The pressure changes were measured by means of a sub-surface pressure gage which was either attached to the bottom of the drill pipe or was allowed to remain at the bottom of the hole as the drill pipe was withdrawn. The relation of the pressure drop occurring when the drill pipe is withdrawn to the viscosity, weight, and gel strength of the mud was, determined. The effect of changes in the rate of withdrawal, rate of drainage from the bit, depth, annular space, diameter of the drill collar, and distance the drill pipe is moved on the pressure drop were also determined. In some cases pressure reductions of over 400 lb. per sq. in. were observed; and, hence, it is apparent that withdrawal of drill pipe can frequently cause blow-outs. The danger can be reduced by proper treatment of the mud. The reduction in pressure which occurs is lower with muds of low gel strength.Normal formation pressures seldom exceed 0.45 lb. per sq. in. per foot, A mud which has a weight of 9.5 lb. per gallon exerts a hydrostatic pressure of approximately 0.49 lb. per sq. in. per foot. A sand found at a depth of 5,000 ft. would have a formation pressure of approximately 2,250 lb. per sq. in. If a 'mud' weighing 9.5 lb. per gallon were used, the hydrostatic pressure would exceed the formation pressure about 200 lb. per sq. in.; and if a mud weighing 10 lb. per gallon were used, the hydrostatic pressure would exceed the formation pressure 350 lb. per sq. in. Hence, it is apparent that even light muds have sufficient hydrostatic head to control gas under normal conditions. Yet in rotary drilling few blow-outs have occurred during actual drilling operations; most of them occur while withdrawing the drill pipe from the hole. This indicates that there is a reduction in mud pressure while making a trip which may be greater than the amount the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the formation pressure. A review of the drilling operations in two fields now being developed shows that in, one of the fields 156 wells have been drilled and 8 blow-outs have occurred., The trouble in every well occurred while the drill pipe was being withdrawn. Six of these wells were abandoned after reaching a depth greater than 4,500 ft. In the other field 735 wells have been drilled, and 19 serious blow-outs have occurred. Of this number, 12 occurred as the drill pipe was being withdrawn, 1 when the drill pipe was out of the hole, and 1 when the drill pipe was being run into the hole. Of the 12 wells which blew out apparently as a result of a change in mud pressure as the drill pipe was being withdrawn, 3 wells were abandoned.",,American Petroleum Institute

Foran(Texon),,,,,,API-34-048,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"Deep wells (8,800 ft.) in the Big Lake field are completed under flowing conditions, using water (not drilling mud) as the circulating medium. In order to prevent penetration of circulating water into the 1,900lb. gas pa, (at 8,200 ft.), the water is lightened with sufficient high-pressure gas (about 800 cu. ft. per barrel) practically to equalize the formation pressure. This method involves the use of hydraulic rotary table and snubbers, flush-joint drill pipe, automatic slips (which grip whenever the drill-pipe weight changes from positive to negative as during a blow-out), pressure-drilling head, pull-down yoke, a high-pressure water knock-out separator, 500-lb. permanent separators, etc. The formations encountered are described briefly, then the drilling method and equipment are described in detail.The practice of completing deep wells in the Big Lake field by means of pressure-drilling equipment has been in continuous operation since September 1932, at which time the Big Lake Oil Company equipped well 7-C in the necessary manner for drilling in the well under a flowing condition. This method of completion had for its purpose a double objective: first, if the well could be kept alive while drilling, it would insure against any possibility of the drilling fluid penetrating the pay section which was definitely known to injure the productive ability of the well; second, it offered a means by which a measurable advance in the conservation of gas and reservoir pressure could be effected. To date eight deep wells have been completed by the use of pressure equipment. During the latter part of 1933 there were three pressure-equipped wells in operation at the same time-well 9-B of the Group One Oil Company being equipped with a National Hydraulic table and accessories, while wells 5-C and 12-C of the Big Lake Oil Company were equipped with Hydrill table and accessories.EquipmentDuring the drilling of the wells from the surface to the top of the pay at about 8,300 ft., only conventional heavy drilling equipment was used. All of the deep wells drilled during 1933 were cased with 34-lb. 7 6/8-in. A.P.I. grade D casing which was set and cemented at from 8,100 ft. to 8,400 ft. While waiting for the cement to set, the standard drilling table was removed from the rig, and the pressure table and auxiliary equipment were installed. This required two to three days; and did not, therefore, delay the time at which the cement plug was due to be drilled. The lay-out of the well equipment as used during the drilling-in process is shown in Fig. 1. The system as used on some of the earlier pressure completions has undergone some modifications-principally in the use of more refinements in measuring the gas, and in the separation of the oil, gas, and water under high rates of flow while drilling. Some additional safety measures have also been developed. The equipment used on the latest completions is as follows: Hydraulic rotary table and snubbers, 3 1/2-in. outside-diameter 13.3-lb. flush-joint drill pipe, automatic slips, pressure-drilling head, small steam-driven water pump for operating hydraulic table and pull-down yoke, 8-ft. 500-ton steel sub-structure, and a 12-ft. concrete cellar with heavy anchor lugs.",,American Petroleum Institute

Graham(Scaled Solutions Limited)|Robert Stalker(Scaled Solutions Limited)|Fazrie Wahid(Scaled Solutions Ltd.),,,,,,SPE-100631-MS,"SPE International Oilfield Scale Symposium, 31 May-1 June, Aberdeen, UK",2006,"Chemical Placement for scale inhibitor squeeze and other near wellbore chemical treatments is recognized as a significant challenge in today's ever more complex operating environments. For heterogeneous wells and long reach horizontal wells, various factors (including heterogeneity, crossflow and pressure gradients between non-communicating zones within the well) all contribute to uneven placement in the reservoir. Current methods to circumvent these problems often rely on extremely expensive coiled tubing operations, staged diversion (temporary shut-off) treatments or overdosing some zones to gain placement in other (e.g. low permeability) zones. For other very near wellbore treatments e.g. acid stimulation, a number of self-diverting strategies have been applied in field treatments with some success. Unfortunately, the properties which make such treatments applicable for acid stimulation may also make them inappropriate for scale squeeze treatments. Other modified lightly viscosified fluids have however been demonstrated to be of significant importance for improving chemical placement thereby reducing the potential for low permeability/high pressure zones being rapidly denuded of chemical during flowback.Critical to our understanding of such a process is the ability to accurately simulate the effectiveness of such treatments in the laboratory and to use the data to build and validate more effective modelling tools to allow field treatments to be designed. The paper examines the potential benefits of using modified injection fluids, including lightly viscosified and shear thinning fluids to aid uniform scale inhibitor placement in complex wells. Laboratory data using dual linear core flood experiments coupled with mathematical modelling are used to describe cases where such fluids are shown to offer benefit for field application and also those where more minimal benefit would be anticipated, such that the risks associated with the use of modified fluids (e.g. potential formation damage and fines mobilization) would outlay the benefits. The paper therefore describes the effective use and interpretation of detailed laboratory core flood data, mathematical modelling and field evidence to describe the benefits associated with the application of modified lightly viscosified shear thinning fluids in scale inhibitor squeeze treatments.INTRODUCTIONChemical placement for scale inhibitor squeeze and other near wellbore chemical treatments is recognized as a significant challenge in today's ever more complex operating environments, especially if effective chemical placement cannot be achieved through conventional bullhead squeeze treatments.[1-8] For heterogeneous wells and long reach horizontal wells, a combination of factors (such as heterogeneity, crossflow and pressure gradients between non-communicating zones within the well) can contribute to uneven placement of a squeeze treatment in the reservoir. This may result in the majority of the squeeze treatment volume being placed in an inappropriate zone in the near-wellbore, which can result in reduced squeeze lifetimes and inadequate scale protection of vulnerable near-wellbore mixing zones. Heterogeneity in the near-wellbore region will obviously affect the placement of a squeeze treatment under permeability control, with most of the volume of a conventional bullhead squeeze being placed in the higher permeability formation. Pressure gradients or crossflow will also influence the placement of an inhibitor slug, with injection being favoured in the lower pressure zones. The presence of crossflow during shut-in can cause a redistribution of the injected slug, resulting in more placement in a lower pressure zone. Other factors such as wellbore friction, layer pressures, the properties of the fluid in place and differences in mobility ratios between different zones also have an impact on chemical placement but will not be considered in this manuscript.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers

Covel(The Pure Oil Co.),,,,,,API-34-056,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"The use of acid to stimulate oil production from Michigan lime wells has shown a need for a study of acid treatment involving an analysis of the formation to be treated, the selection of a suitable type and amounts of acid, the time of treatments with respect to date of well completion, and an economic analysis of the results.GeneralThere are now about 900 producing oil wells in Michigan, of which number about 700 are producing from limestone formations considered favorable for the stimulation of production by the use of acid. During the past year and one-half over 450 wells have been given more than 1,000 acid treatments, using approximately 1,000,000 gal of hydrochloric acid. The net result of these treatments has been the stimulation and the conservation of oil production that might have otherwise been delayed or never produced because of the economics of operating small wells. While acid treatment of wells has been in progress, laboratory research and field, tests have been continued with a view of obtaining better results by the use of an acid suited to the formation to be treated, the determination of the amounts of acid to .use, the time for initial and successive treatments, and the analysis of the increase or early recovery in oil production.Acid Suited to FormationEven though hydrochloric acid reacts to dissolve pure limestone,1aoperators have found it advisable to furnish to the chemical-treating company for analysis a sample of the producing formation to be treated, particularly if the treatment is to be made on a well in a new area where the pay formation may be dolomitic or partially consist of materials not readily dissolved by acid. The variation in the action of two types of acid on the Traverse limestone is indicated in Table 1. In Table 1, well C is a striking example of the advantages of determining proper acid to use for the formation to be treated. It further develops that the producing formations of a well often vary in acid-soluble materials with depth. Table 2, showing the change in solubility of the pay formation with the depth of a well, indicates that acid B probably will dissolve more material and, thus, offer better possibilities for increasing production by the use of acid. Table 3 shows the wide variation in the percentage of solubility of a well core sample in various blends of acid, indicating the necessity of making analysis to determine the proper acid to obtain best results. The Dundee limestone, which is probably the most prolific oil-producing formation in Michigan, has been found to be about 92 to 97 per cent soluble in a 15-per cent concentration of hydrochloric acid. One 42-gal. barrel of this strength acid2is calculated to dissolve about 0.4 cu. ft. of formation and leave a resultant calcium-chloride solution about 71 per cent saturated. It is considered good practice to use a properly-inhibited acid, which practically eliminates the reaction of acid with steel, and yet does not appreciably retard the action of the acid with limestone.",,American Petroleum Institute
178,320741,,Reduction of Lifting Costs Through Close Inspection of Production and Equipment Records,C.L. Moore(Chanslor-Canfield-Midway Oil Co.)|H.S. Stark(Honolulu Consolidated Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-34-062,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of keeping detailed production and equipment records in order that full advantage ma,' be taken of their interpretation towards lowering lifting costs. The most important question concerning the value of good production records is the expense an operator may incur in keeping records and still show a comfortable margin of profit above the cost of tabulating the data. It is impossible to state definitely just where the dividing line lies between the maintenance of an over-elaborate system of records as compared with the case wherein the lack of pertinent data may lead to incorrect deductions. From the experiences covered in this paper it is concluded that, if proper deductions are made from collected data, the expense required to install a system of keeping the important production records is well warranted. The first part of the paper deals with a group of wells producing light oil and the efforts to maintain production costs at a minimum by keeping various records., The second part of the paper illustrates the necessity of proper individual well gauging on a group of marginal wells producing heavy oil. The producing operations, but more especially the control of direct pumping costs, which are discussed in this paper refer to actual experiences of certain operators in the Buena Vista Hills field in California. The first group consists of some 140 wells, drilled to an average depth of 3,100 ft., from which is pumped ,27-28 gravity oil through 21/2 -in. tubing. In the majority, of cases this production is recovered by the common California type of cast-iron liner and steel plunger pump. The surface equipment consists of 122-ft. derricks with two-speed oil-well motors driving the walking beams through the conventional standard end by means of flat belts and countershafts. Oil production averages approximately 25 per cent water; but the water is not markedly corrosive, and no difficulties are encountered on account of emulsion. Sand trouble is not excessive, and the wells in general need bailing only at one- to two-year intervals. Gas-oil ratios range from 1,000 to 5,000 cu. ft. per bbl. of oil. All wells have individual traps, and tank facilities are so arranged that each well can be gauged at least part of every 24 hours.Pump Repair Shop RecordsIt has been the practice of the operator to employ a full-time pump repairman to re-fit, clean ,up, and keep records of all the new and used pumps. His employment has been amply justified by the greatly reduced yearly cost for replacement of slightly 'worn pump fittings, which were formerly discarded by the commercial shops and replaced with new parts. Each worn pump brought in for dismantling is carefully micrometered for plunger and liner wear. A card showing the original fit, date of installation, and well number enables the repairman to send out a new plunger of the correct over-size when necessary, and to credit each worn pump or plunger with the total barrels of fluid that it produced before wearing down to a point where it needed replacing.",,American Petroleum Institute

Heretofore in the old shallow fields of the East the shooting of oil wells was a comparatively simple procedure, generally productive of more or less gratifying results if oil or gas was present at the horizon shot. The first wells were shot with nitroglycerin in the 1860's, and the practice soon became more or less standardized as to mode and equipment. After the novelty wore off and the practice became common, the shooting of wells became a matter of routine; and the size of the shot rep-mined about the only feature of the operation with which the producer concerned himself-supervision of the operation being often left to some subordinate field official whose main concern was to get the shot safely into the well and exploded. The results were in most cases accepted in a spirit of fatalism. If the shot made a good well, everyone concerned was happy. If the results were nil, it was considered just too bad ; and if successive shots did no better, the result was accepted as inevitable-regretfully, of course, but with the good grace and admirable nonchalance which is so characteristic of the oil men. The crude shooting practices of those early days traveled westward with the industry. The technique of drilling gradually improved. As productive horizons were found at lower levels, producers and operators have been ever willing and eager to spend money for research and experimentation to improve their efficiency in drilling and producing, until present practice has been reduced to almost an exact science. Strange to say, during this period apparently very little, if any, thought or attention was given to the improvement of shooting technique. We find few people even today who have more than a nodding acquaintance with explosives or who seem to be at all curious about what they are, or what they can accomplish with intelligent use. It was not until considerable information recently became available on oil-well explosives, illustrating how explosive energy could be harnessed to do useful work, that forward-looking producers came to realize that there is more to the shooting of a well than the mere mechanical lowering of a certain quantity of explosive and getting it exploded along lines of least resistance. Any statement on physical results of a shot in the pay stratum is of necessity purely conjectural and academic; consequently, we must at least to a large extent gage our conclusions by the known effects on the productivity of the well and on results of different explosives on various types of rock in quarrying or mining practice, where the peculiar characteristics of nearly every type of explosive are studied and understood, and where their effects are visible and can be analyzed.",,American Petroleum Institute

The experimental methods used in their measurement are described in principle. Illustrative data are shown in graphical form. A number of applications of such information to the problems of petroleum production arc suggested.Physical ChangesThroughout the whole series of steps involved in the production and transportation of crude petroleum and natural gas, the conditions under which the hydrocarbon materials find themselves are almost continually changing. These changes of temperature, pressure, elevation or velocity may be gradual or abrupt; but in either case they result in corresponding changes in the properties of the complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. Since these processes involve changes in the volumes occupied, as well as changes in the pressures and temperatures prevailing, they must inevitably result in energy transfers as well. For these reasons the study of the fundamental principles of petroleum and natural-gas production and transportation leads directly to that branch of physical science called thermodynamics, which deals with transformations of energy between its various forms. The contents of petroleum pools are endowed with large amounts of energy due to the pressures and temperatures under which the fluids exist. This energy should -be utilized, as far as is economically possible, in doing many useful tasks. However, even by ideal operations, 'we could not hope to get benefits from all of this energy store, and that portion which should be readily available is easy to lose and dissipate in forms which are economically useless. If this tremendous endowment is to be properly utilized, it stands to reason that we must know something of, the behavior of these liquids and gases under changes of pressure and temperature- with particular reference to energy quantities. Only that portion of thermodynamics is needed which relates to the evaluation of energy transformations accompanyingphysicalchanges in systems consisting of liquids, gases, or both liquids and gases.Thermodynamic ValuesThe principal quantities with which one is concerned may ,be listed as follows, giving convenient symbols and units:Pressure, P, lb. per sq. in. absolute.Temperature, T, deg. F., absolute (called deg. Rankine).Volume, V, cu. ft.Heat content, H. b.t.u..Entropy, S, b.t.u.. per deg. RankineThe quantity called heat content is also known as total heat and as enthalpy. It is a very useful quantity, because changes in it indicate directly the amount of heat gained (or lost) by a system of constant mass during a change occurring at constant pressure, or the equivalent of the work done during a continuous- flow adiabatic expansion. Furthermore, throttling processes without addition of heat-such as often occur at valves where the pressure drop is large-are characterized by the heat content of the system remaining constant. The quantity called entropy serves to indicate how any given change in a system affects the ability of the system to dousefulwork. In a frictionless continuous flow process, the entropy change involved may be used to determine the amount of heat absorbed or given off.",,American Petroleum Institute

Reistle Jr.(East Texas Engineering Assoc.),,,,,,API-34-096,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"IntroductionThe East Texas field, the largest oil field under development in the world, is located in Smith, Rusk, Gregg, Upshur, and Cherokee Counties in the state of Texas. The discovery well, drilled by C. M. Joiner, was completed September 8, 1930, and is located approximately 7 miles north of the city of Henderson, near the eastern limit of the field. Within less than one year the new field became the predominant factor of the petroleum industry. On August 16, eleven months after completion of the discovery well, there were 1,644 wells producing 584,475 bbl. of oil per day. At that time (August 16, 1931) the field was placed under military control, and production ceased entirely until September 6, 1931. On January 29, 1934 there were 12,170 producing wells in the field, approximately 70 new wells were being completed each week, and the average well spacing was approximately one well to l.5 acres. Of these 12,170 producing wells on January 29, 1934, 1,702 were classified as marginal wells, and were allowed to produce 20 bbl. per day; the remaining 10,468 wells were allowed to produce 5 per cent of their one-hour potential. The total allowable production of the field on January 29, 1934 was 399,095 bbl. F. H. Lahee1ain a paper before the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers in 1931, described the conditions existing in the East Texas field at that time: We all know that, through the ignorance of some and the greed of others here in East Texas, the whole industry was swept towards the brink of ruin. Efforts towards proration, efforts towards any reasonable form of cooperation, failed. No matter what plan was proposed, its practical application seemed impossible of attainment-principally because of the diversity of opinion of those concerned and the fear of some operators that their -rights would be infringed upon by others. Similar conditions have prevailed during several periods since that time. Fortunately, by compromise on the part of the different schools of thought within the oil industry methods have been adopted that are perhaps far from ideal, but which, nevertheless, have enabled the Texas Railroad Commission to establish some measure of orderly control, and prevented a complete demoralization of the industry. On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that the potential danger of demoralization still exists, as demonstrated by recent court attacks on the proration powers of the railroad commission. Nevertheless, I believe I am safe in saying that the majority of companies and individuals in any way associated with the oil industry realize the necessity for orderly production, and that they are hopeful of interpreting our present laws or, if necessary, of developing new laws that will insure equitable proration and effect its permanent enforcement.",,American Petroleum Institute

The stratigraphic position of the deep sands of the eastern region and their productivity are mentioned, and the status of recent developments in the Oriskany sand in Pennsylvania and New York is outlined. Prospects for future developments in the Oriskany of Pennsylvania are discussed from the standpoint of structure; regional favorability, and known characteristics of the sand.INTRODUCTIONIt is proposed here to review briefly the eastern deep sand situation, referring especially to the Oriskany sand in Pennsylvania. In this region the term deep sands commonly refers to the Oriskany and Medina sandstones, but may also include the Trenton limestone. The stratigraphic position of these sands relative to the Bradford Venango, and other well known shallow sand horizons is shown in Fig. 1. In general the Oriskany occurs something like 2,500 ft. below the shallow sand zone, the Medina 1,000 ft. to 2,000 ft. below the Oriskany, and the Trenton something like 1,800 ft. to 2,000 ft. below the Medina. Briefly stated thus, these figures are meant to indicate order of magnitude only. Of these deep sands the Trenton has produced some gas in New York, but we know of only one, well1athat is believed to have reached the Trenton in Pennsylvania, and it is dry. The Medina in New York is productive throughout a larger area than any other formation; but in Pennsylvania it has been tested by only a few scattered wells, and is not commercially important. Prior to 1930 there was no commercial production from the Oriskany sand either in New York or Pennsylvania. Active interest in this sand dates from March 1930, when a 6,000,000-cu.-ft. gas well was completed in the Oriskany at Tyrone, New York (Fig. 2). This discovery, close to an eastern industrial market, naturally led to an intensive leasing campaign, am). exploration of the adjacent region soon was under way. In September 1930 discovery was made' at Tioga field, Tioga County (Pennsylvania), and in November 1931 at Hebron field, Potter County. In addition the Oriskany is productive at two other localities in Potter County, and at Anen and Greenwood fields (New York).",,American Petroleum Institute

Hammar(American Petroleum Institute),,,,,,API-34-117,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"This report is a summary of recent work on a research project relating to source beds of petroleum that is being undertaken under the auspices of the U. S. Geological Survey and the American Petroleum Institute. The paper reviews briefly the methods of determining the organic content of sediments, particularly the method of estimating the organic content by means of the degree of oxidation of the sediments; bur its main object is to present a preliminary, statement of the organic content of 120 formations, or parts of formations, based on more than 25,000 samples from oil-producing areas in California, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Sediments, in general, contain little organic mailer. The organic content of very few formations is more than 4 per cent, and the general average is about 1.5 per cent. Many formations in which the organic content is comparatively high, i. e., more than 2 per cent, are associated with oil horizons. This feature seems to indicate that richness in organic content is a favorable indication of source beds. However, the content of organic matter is not an absolute index of source beds, as some rich sediments are not associated with oil horizons; and some oil horizons are not associated with' rich sediments. Evidently, other factors have to be considered. Some of the data that have been obtained seem to indicate that a comparatively high volatility or low degree of oxidation of the sediments may be favorable indications of source beds.INTRODUCTIONThe American Petroleum Institute for the past eight years has been sponsoring an investigation of source beds of petroleum. During the last three years it has had the financial cooperation of the U. S. Geological Survey in this work. Source beds are the substances in the ground that generate petroleum. If no 'source beds are present in an area, there can be no oil field. Consequently, in the exploration for oil in unproven territory it is highly desirable for the oil operator to know the extent to which source beds occur in the area; for, if adequate source beds are not present, there is no object in his wasting money by futile drilling. The purpose of this research project is to ascertain the diagnostic characteristics of source beds in order to aid the geologist in advising the oil operator most effectively to prospect unknown areas for petroleum. As petroleum consists of compounds in which carbon is the principal component, its origin must be intimately associated with the carbon compounds that have been preserved in the sediments. These carbon compounds are, derived from the remains of plants and animals that lived in the water at the time the sediments were deposited. Consequently, in order to trace the changes that have taken place in the sediments during the millions of years they have lain buried in the ground, the investigation of the problem began with recent sediments. Five years were devoted to the study of recent sediments, and a comprehensive report of the work has been published.1a",,American Petroleum Institute
184,320747,,Recent Developments in Joint Designs of Tubular Goods,W.C. Shutts(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-132,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"Considerable development is under way to develop joint strength in both casing and drill pipe. It has been necessary to set casing with consistently lowering safety factors in both collapse and tensile strength of the joint due to increasing drilling depths. Common practice now is to use safety factors of 1% in collapse and 2% in tensile strength of the joint. It is necessary to set casing with lower safety factors than the above for 10,000. ft. wells using our present A.P.I. pipe. Sever 1 new type joints are now being used on casing to increase the joint efficiency, and on drill pipe to overcome the fatiguing action within the threaded joint; and others are in the development stage.FOREWORDDuring the past few years there has been a decided trend toward the development and use of casing and drill pipe with joints other than the present conventional A.P.I. design. This trend is brought about by the use of flush-joint or semi-flush joint pipe and a search for joints of higher strength caused by the increasing drilling depths in the search for oil. The selection of casing and drill pipe is an item of major importance in the development of an oil well, both from a monetary consideration and from the viewpoint of good practice, when it is realized that from 25 to 35 per cent of the initial well investment is in casing cost and that other factors such as sizes, weights, setting depths, and casing combinations affect the success of the well from its beginning to the depletion of the producing zones.ProblemThe increasing depths to which wells are now being drilled have brought about the need and use of casing and drill pipe of much greater strength, both in collapse and joint strength, than that required but a few years ago. Wells are now being drilled' below 10,000 ft., and it is not uncommon practice to set 8,500 ft. or more of casing. These increasing depths have caused considerable discussion as to our pipe requirements for 10,000-ft. wells, and it is the purpose of this paper to call attention to the limitations of our present standard tubular goods and to recent developments in joint design. A survey indicates that safety factors as used in actual practice a few years ago were about 2.5 in collapse and 3.5 in tensile strength of joint for 3,500-ft. wells, and about 1.5 to 2.0 in collapse and 3.0 in joint strength for 5,500-ft. to 6,500-ft. wells; whereas casing has recently been set with as low a safety factor as 0.67 in collapse and 2.2 in joint strength. However, it is not the practice to select casing with the exact wall thickness or weight to resist the theoretical collapsing and pull-out loads, but to provide the greatest safety factor within the limits of economical consideration. This is logical practice because of the indeterminable factors in the stresses to which casing will be subjected. Although casing is being set with consistently lowering safety factors, it is the writer's opinion (substantiated by the opinions of a large number of operators and manufacturers) that good practice dictates that casing should not be run beyond a safety factor of 1.5 in collapse and 2.5 in joint strength-and these safety factors are used as an arbitrary basis in this paper.",,American Petroleum Institute
185,320748,,"A Study of the Composition and Behavior of Drilling Mud, the Qtiantities Required for Circulation, and the Reduction of Friction Losses by the Use of Full-Hole Tool Joints",Roy Silent(Petroleum Securities Co.),,,,,,API-34-140,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"In this paper consideration is given to the composition and properties of drilling mud and the problems encountered in the circulation system, with special reference to frictional resistance offered by the restricted diameters through the present A.P.I. tool joints. It is pointed out how the colloidal content of the mud affects the viscosity and the rate of shear, thus affecting the debris-carrying capacity of the mud. Generally, the tendency of the mud to set or jell increases with the viscosity, bin with ordinary mud the mixing action of the pump, etc., is sufficient to maintain a satisfactory state of shear. Further, it has been found that viscosity and shear can be controlled by the use of reducers, and that best practice requires that mud be maintained at such viscosities and rates of shear that the cuttings can be properly separated to minimize abrasive action in the pumps and other portions of the system. Due to the low rate of settling of excavated particles caused by so-called hindered settling, the velocity of the ascending column of fluid in the well ma)' be relatively low and still produce satisfactory results. From data obtained from pump manufacturers and from field observation, it is found that a high value for the ordinary flow of liquid through the circulation system is 1 % cu. ft. per sec., with velocities of 8.4 ft. through the drill pipe and 0.5 ft. in the annular space outside. It is further pointed out that the velocity heads required for observed velocities are negligible, and almost the entire pump pressure goes to overcome the friction in the drill pile and tool joints. Of this friction, that caused by the tool joints may amount to three and a half times that of the drill pipe proper. This additional friction may be almost entirely removed by utilizing full-hole tool joints. Further, that when this element of friction is thus removed, adequate amounts of fluid can be circulated with a fraction of the present effort. With scientifically proportioned and conditioned mud, arid attention to the combined factors entering into the problems of mud circulation, it will be found that the now hectic scramble for higher boiler and pump pressures is unnecessary, as the effects of such pressures are now mostly wasted in a vain attempt to overcome the vicious circle induced by remediable fractional resistance.Scope of PaperIt is the purpose of this paper to consider the composition and properties of rotary-drilling mud and their relation to the problems encountered in pumping it through the circulation system of drilling oil wells, together with special consideration of the effect of full hole tool joints in mitigating frictional resistance. This paper is presented in connection with the paper prepared by an associate author who will deal with the mechanical construction and proportioning of full-hole tool joints and the problems attendant thereto.",,American Petroleum Institute

Gignoux(Reed Roller Bit Co.),,,,,,API-34-149,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"The purpose of this paper is to acquaint those who may be interested with full-hole tool joints and the mechanical development thereof. The introduction deals with the brief history of tool joints in general and patents thereon. The evolution of the full-hole feature is shown by reference to various designs and standards adopted by the American Petroleum Institute. Metallurgical development of tool-joint steel is briefly outlined, and present-day practice of heat-treatment results and alloy selection is shown. A description of the recently adopted A.P.I. full-hole tool joints is given, and comparative dimensions are shown on the regular and A.P.I. full-hole joints. A condensed list of advantageous uses of full-hole joints is given, and a conclusion is made to the effect that the A.P.I. full-hole-joint design is logical, and joints made to these dimensional specifications will show the user economy and satisfaction. The paper is closed with an appendix, giving the details of a calculation which proves that a full-hole joint is designed to offer a reliable safety factor in strength when subjected to extreme torsion.IntroductionLike many indispensable drilling appliances, the rotary tool joint was conceived not by accident but by virtue of urgent necessity. When one turns back the pages of history of rotary drilling to the era before the use of tool joints, he can visualize the tedious process of making, a bit change in a well being drilled. In those days the drill pipe was connected entirely with couplings, a method which was mechanically and economically unsatisfactory. In the early part of the year 1908, Mericos H. Whittier, then a driller, conceived the idea of the tool joint. It is said that one day, after his drilling crew had disconnected stand after stand of drill pipe, which was joined by means of ordinary pipe couplings, he sat down on the derrick floor and visualized a coupling with a coarse-pitch substantially-tapered thread which might be connected or disconnected by only a few turns. Mr. Whittier soon after had the Bunting Iron Works of Coalinga, California, construct his idea by boring out the axis of some cable-tool joints and threading these joints permanently on the ends of drill pipe. So successful was the experiment that Whittier, on July 1, 1908, applied for a patent on this method of connecting drill pipe together. A patent was granted him on July 12, 1910 on what he termed a rotary well-boring box and pin. Following in the footsteps of the Whittier patented tool joint came several patented modifications, many of which have proved to be of questionable merit. In the early part of 1924 the development was started of a joint having a bore greater than any of the conventional joints then being produced. Primarily such a joint was developed to accommodate the use of a drilling bit, invented by John C. Stokes, which bit could be changed without removing the drill stem from the well. Also, it was then pointed out that because of the large-diameter hole the flow of slush through the drill stem is not restricted.",,American Petroleum Institute

Super 13% Cr combines low carbon content with increased Ni and Mo content, and particular heat treatment processes, in order to achieve its superior properties. To date, the literature available on this material is limited, with most articles concentrating on the explanation and remedies to major line-pipe failures that occurred on welds.This paper summarizes tests to assess the role of chloride content in PH2S and pH testing solution. The negative effect of H2S saturation of the solution was observed, leading to a decrease of the passivation stage of the steel. Taking into account electrochemical parameters such as current densities and corrosion potentials, various environments (pH, chloride content and H2S) where SSC is likely to occur were investigated. The influence of the three parameters led to the creation of a 3-Dimensional mapping of SSC susceptibility with regard to the use of Super 13% Cr Stainless Steels. The Fit-For-Purpose philosophy of the new edition of NACE MR0175/ISO 15156 standard was used to develop this map.Key wordsSuper 13% Cr, Super Martensitic Stainless Steel, modified 13% Cr, Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC), depassivation pH, permeation, diffusion, electrochemistry, current density.ForewordThe terms conventional, alloyed or super 13% Cr martensitic Stainless Steels (SS) are commonly used as material denominations in the literature. Conventional 13% Cr martensitic SS refers to AISI 420 like steels with carbon wt. % between 0.15 and 0.22 and chromium wt. % between 12 and 14. Modified or Super 13% Cr martensitic SS include steels with a wt. % of carbon lower than 0.03 and additions of molybdenum and nickel. A wide range of terminology requires clarification with respect to the alloying content especially such as C, Cr, Ni and Mo: &quot;lean?? (13Cr-&lt;2.5Ni-&lt;1Mo), &quot;medium?? (13Cr-&lt;4.5Ni-&lt;2Mo such as 13-4-1 martensitic SS) and &quot;fat?? (13Cr-&lt;6.5Ni-&gt;2Mo such as 13-5-2 martensitic SS) have also been proposed for specific applications (see UNS 41425-41426 and 41427). The units adopted in the significant number of publications vary considerably as well: pressure (MPa, bar, atm, psi) but also temperature (&deg;C, &deg;F) or concentrations (mol eq., vol. %, wt. %, ppm or g/L) and so on. This is why, units of data presented in this paper will be expressed essentially in MPa or bar (0.1 MPa = 1 bar) for pressure, &deg;C for temperature and g/L or ppm for concentrations.IntroductionThe growing demand for energy has resulted in a general need to produce fields with a significant CO2 content. The presence of corrosive species (among them CO2, H2S and chlorides) has a pronounced effect on corrosion in producing wells. Carbon dioxide is almost always present and its effect on corrosion is primarily by decreasing the pH of the water phase. Carbon dioxide promotes general corrosion, localized corrosion or formation of hard iron carbonate scales. For the last 25 years, the use of 13% Cr seamless steel pipes has been the most cost effective solution to protect against sweet wet CO2 corrosion.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers
188,320750,,The Well-Spacing Problem-Low Well Density Increases Ultimate Recovery,John R. Suman(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-34-158,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"It has long been assumed that, in the development of an oil field, maximum ultimate recovery can be obtained with a maximum density of wells. The author states that, on the contrary, the greatest ultimate recovery results from relatively wide spacing of wells, because it permits the most efficient utilization of the reservoir energy in moving oil from the pore spaces into the well bore and up to the surface of the ground. In common producing practices, reservoir energy has often been carelessly and wastefully depleted long before the oil content of the reservoir was removed. In such cases the ultimate recovery has been pitifully low; and the oil still remaining in the reservoir, amounting to one-half or, in some cases, as high as 90 per cent of the original content, can now be recovered only in negligibly small proportions. The author cites cases where old abandoned fields have been repressured and have produced a worthwhile additional volume of oil. Data are given on several representative fields showing the estimated recoverable reserve, the well density, the production rate, the total years of productive life, at the so-called allowable rate, at the maximum possible rate, and at the most efficient rate of production.It has long been assumed among petroleum engineers that, in the development of an oil field, maximum ultimate recovery results from a maximum density of producing ells: that is to say, the larger the number of producing wells per unit area, the greater the ultimate recovery of oil from a given field. Cutler, for example, in a classic analysis of producing practice in the United States, concluded that quadrupling the number of wells per unit area doubled the ultimate production from that area. It is the thesis of this paper that greatest ultimate recovery results not from closest well spacing; but, on the contrary, greatest ultimate recovery results from relatively wide well spacing, as compared with common producing practice in this country. There are other advantages, of course, in spacing wells widely. These advantages have often been noted, and -some discussion of them will follow, but the real theme of this argument is the fact-not so generally realized, nor even generally accepted-that actually more oil is recovered from the typical oil field by wide spacing of wells (within reasonable limits), than by the extremely close spacing which the producing industry has accepted as good practice in the past.Full Use of Reservoir EnergyThe secret (if it be a secret) of obtaining the largest possible recovery from an oil-field reservoir lies in making the most efficient use of the so-called reservoir energy of that field. Reservoir energy is the principal agency, and practically the only agency, for expelling oil from the pore spaces of a natural reservoir into the wells and for lifting oil through the wells to the surface. Reservoir energy is susceptible of rapid and pre-proportions. The author cites cases where old abandoned fields have been repressured and have produced a worthwhile additional volume of oil. Data are given on several representative fields showing the estimated recoverable reserve, the well density, the production rate, the total years of productive life, at the so-called allowable rate, at the maximum possible rate, and at the most efficient rate of production.",,American Petroleum Institute
189,320751,,Probabilities and Wildcats,J.T. Hayward(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-34-167,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"INTRODUCTIONThe mathematical theory of probabilities was originally developed in connection with games of chance. Nowadays it has been applied to biology, physics, engineering, and too many business problems; and it is, of course, of fundamental importance in insurance. Decisions whether to drill or not to drill a wildcat well, or to purchase or not to purchase a p!1rt interest in royalty under wildcat acreage, have 'constantly to be made by executives in the land and geological and in the production departments of oil companies. The conclusions depend upon a number of things, among them the cost of the operation, expected return if a successful result is obtained, the capital available for the venture, and the probability of a successful result. Unless concrete numerical values are assigned to all these quantities, only dubious conclusions can he arrived at; but once numerical values have been assigned, they can be used in a number of simple equations that will facilitate the decisions to he made and place them upon an arithmetical basis. The primary object of this paper is to discuss the derivation of these equations and their manipulation. A subsidiary and independent object is to outline plans for the classification of wildcat-well data in such a manner that they will be available and handy for use in the equations. Needless to say, it is not suggested that an)' mechanical manipulation of formulas can replace expert knowledge and judgment, but it is maintained that the methods outlined in this paper can assist the expert in arriving at his conclusions and in demonstrating to others how he arrived at them.By way of illustration, let us consider a lottery in which there is a single prize of $60, and for which six tickets are sold. It is obvious that anybody purchasing all six tickets will win $60; and that, therefore, the six tickets are together worth $60. Since the lottery is presupposed to be fair, anyone ticket is worth $10. The purchaser of a ticket has a one-in-six &sect; chance of winning $60, and his expectation, therefore, is $10. Expressed an equation, we have:(mathematical equation available in full paper)Again, suppose a die is rolled, and that every time an ace turns up the player is to receive $60. Here also there is a one-in-six chance of winning $60, and each throw is consequently worth $10. There is, nevertheless, an important difference between these two games. In the case of the lottery a purchaser who took all six tickets would be certain of the prize of $60; but the player with the die might pay for, and play, six or more throws without being certain of winning anything. Nevertheless, this does not alter the mathematical value of the expectation. In mathematical calculations it is customary to express a probability in the form of a ratio in which the numerator corresponds to the number of favorable (or unfavorable) outcomes, and the denominator to the total possible number 'of outcomes. The probability of a die turning up an ace in a single throw is, for instance, one in six, written 1/6; and of it?s not turning up an ace, five chances in six, or 5/6. Certainty is under this convention represented by unity. This corresponds with everyday language, ninety-nine chances out of (or in) a hundred denoting nearly certain, and one hundred out of a hundred (100/100=1) corresponding to certainty.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hightower(Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Co.),,,,,,API-34-176,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1934,"The author states that accidental injuries in producing operations constitute an unnecessary waste, and are an indication of inefficiencies in operating methods; therefore, accident prevention constitutes a major problem for consideration by operating executives and workers alike. He recommends:The preparation and adoption of state petroleum safety orders to compel the negligent operator to provide safe equipment and adopt safe operating methods.That accident prevention be made a definite part of all operating programs, as the elimination of mistakes prevents the mishaps which damage equipment or injure workers.That closer 'attention be given to the selection of workers and the placing of applicants on jobs according to their qualifications.Greater effort in instructing the new man concerning his work, his company, and the industry-thereby increasing his interest in, and understanding of, his work.Development of standard operating procedures to go along with A.P.I. equipment standards (reference is made to the A.P.I. accident-prevention manuals and production codes).Continuous inspection of properties by interested and experienced workers.That fire and accident-prevention protective equipment be provided, and workers instructed in it care and use.Compensation CostsAs executives and engineers of the production division of the petroleum industry, your primary interest is that of getting oil to the surface at the lowest possible cost. Your purpose here today is to discuss your mutual problems, exchange experiences and develop ways and means of reducing costs and improving efficiency. The interest of the accident-prevention engineer in the petroleum industry is not foreign to your own interests. He also is concerned with lowering costs and improving efficiency through the elimination of waste and the reduction of mishaps which bring about injury to workmen and damage to equipment. Accident prevention makes no special claim to virtue on the ground that the work is humanitarian. It is well, of course, that industry is human enough to spend money and to plan work so that its employees will be spared the physical pain and the financial loss which follow in the wake of accidents. This personal interest in the welfare of its workers on the part of industry, within itself, pays good dividends; but accident-prevention work produces a more direct return than this. It justifies itself and pays its own way by reducing insurance costs, 'lessening absenteeism, saving equipment, and increasing efficiency. Proof of these facts may be found in the records of hundreds of oil companies, in the reports of the National Safety Council, and in the office of the Institute's own Accident-Prevention Department. In 1927 one worker out of each unit group of' six in the production division of our industry suffered a lost time accident. For the year 1933 this record had been improved to a point where only one worker out of seventeen sustained a lost-time injury. Viewing it strictly from a dollar-and-cents standpoint, this reduction in disabling injuries has meant thousands of dollars to the industry.",,American Petroleum Institute
191,320753,,Cementing Methods for Excluding Water from Producing Wells,R.E. Watson(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-35-008,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"This paper is presented as a supplement to previous papers in order to cover recent developments along the lines of oil-well cementing. Three cementing methods have been developed and utilized successfully for plugging off water. One method consists of plugging off bottom water in producing wells by means of an especially-designed tubing plug and placing the cement under pressure. The second method pertains to under-reaming and cementing of oil-string casing to shut off water occurring only a few feet above the oil-producing horizon. The third method is a refinement of the old squeeze job, and requires, first, ascertaining the pressure necessary to pump water into the formation being cemented, followed by the proper cement slurry under pressure.PLUGGING OFF BOTTOM WATERThe plugging back of wells with cement is general practice; and in drilling wells, where the plugs are large, the placing of the cement by the equalized-column method has been uniformly successful. However, considerable difficulty has been encountered in accurately and effectively setting short (10 ft. or less) cement plugs by this method; the preference previously had been for expanding lead or lead-wool plugs. In the Salt Flat and Darst Creek fields at Caldwell and Guadalupe Counties, Texas, there has been developed a method of placing short cement plugs which, so far as the mechanical placing of the cement is concerned, is entirely satisfactory; and cement is now being generally used for plugging off water. In the Edwards Lime fields considerable water has always been produced with the oil. This is due to the movement of the water up the fault-plane and into the reservoir from the high side of the structure. The problem of water disposal is an expensive and troublesome one; so that any reduction of the water-oil ratio is very much to be desired. By selective abandonment and systematic' and continuous plugging back, the water percentage has been kept at its economic minimum. The first method of placing the cement was that developed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines in the Powell field, and it has been used in the Salt Flat field until recently- when the present method was developed. The U. S. Bureau of Mines method included: 1, washing the well with a blank string of tubing until clean; 2, introduction of a wooden plug about 2 ft. long into the tubing; 3, the spacing of the tubing about 1 ft. frol11 bottom; 4, pumping the mixed cement into the tubing, forcing the plug down; 5, pumping water on top of the cement until the plug-striking bottom causes increase in pressure; 6, raising the tubing the requisite number of feet to be plugged, after corrections had been made for pump wash and distance tubing had been spaced from bottom; 7, washing excess cement from the well. The equipment used in these operations included the following:(mathematical equation available in full paper)Considerable difficulty was encountered in catching the instant when the plug hit bottom, with the attendant possibility of washing the cement from the bottom of die well.",,American Petroleum Institute
192,320754,,Methods for Determining How Much of a Frozen or Cemented Column of Pipe Is Free,J.T. Hayward(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-35-016,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Drill pipe and casing sometimes accidentally become stuck in the hole. Some method of finding out where the pipe is frozen is then desirable, so that decisions can be made as to whether to make further efforts to free it, or to cut or shoot it off and side track. In the latter case what we require to know is how much is frozen so that a shot can be properly placed, or the knife run a minimum n number of times and yet recover as much as possible. The object of the present paper is to outline methods for determining where the pipe is stuck, or conversely how much is free. There is another direction in which this information may be useful. It is becoming of increasing importance, when casing is cemented, to know how far up the column is actually cemented. There are, for instance, occasions when it is important that the cement should not come up beyond a certain height and cover an upper show that could be later exploited by cutting and pulling the pipe or perforating with the gun. At other times, it is wished to bring the cement above a certain level, so that water may be shut off from oil sands behind the pipe, and the latter later produced through perforations. It is also probable that too much cement is often used on a job on account of the uncertainty, leading to unnecessary expenditure on cement, excessive back pressure on the producing formation where this has already been drilled, and the loss of pipe if and when the well is abandoned. The assumptions, made when calculating the number of sacks of cement required to reach to a given height behind a column of casing, contain a number of possibilities of error. It is suggested that, after a column of pipe has been cemented and before drilling is resumed, the height to which the cement has actually risen and formed a bond be checked and recorded for future reference. The following two methods for determining the amount of pipe that is free have been worked out and used with success in practice.First MethodThis depends upon the weight indicator, the underlying principle being to change the longitudinal stress in the column while measuring the change in stretch, and from the data so obtained to calculate the free length. This method is not new, but the manner in which it is carried out and the precautions taken to minimize errors due to friction are, the writer believes, published for the first time. If the weight indicator does not read in pounds, the readings in points must be converted to pounds; and if the indicator is on the dead line and indicates the line pull, the readings converted to pounds must be multiplied by the number of lines going to the traveling block, the product giving the pounds pull exerted by the hook. Examine the weight indicator, and make the adjustments recommended by its maker to insure proper working.",,American Petroleum Institute

Babson(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-35-022,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Apparatus used in studying the flow characteristics of muds and the performance of muds when circulated against artificial formations are described. The apparatus used to study flow characteristics is an adaptation of the MacMichael rotary viscosimeter. The results of a number of tests with this instrument are shown and discussed. The results of tests in the performance testing apparatus show that in most cases neither the pressure differential between the circulating mud and formations nor the apparent viscosity of the mud is of great importance in determining the rate at which mud will lose water to formations or in determining the thickness of mud cakes deposited. Temperature, however, has a marked effect: the higher the temperature, the more rapid will be the loss of water from mud to formations. A single test in the performance testing apparatus will serve to evaluate a mud with sufficient precision to make the results of practical value in selecting and controlling muds for use in difficult drilling projects.The quality of drilling mud is now generally recognized as being of vital concern in rotary-drilling operations, particularly-where deep wells or wells drilled in caving formations are involved. Many operators are of the opinion that mild quality is a dominant factor, influencing the practicability of drilling wells in caving formations and limiting depths to which wells can be drilled. In spite of this situation, there appears to be a dearth of satisfactory methods for evaluating rotary muds, particularly with respect to their performance under operating conditions. This paper presents testing methods which have been developed in an effort to define and evaluate the properties of drilling muds that are of importance in actual drilling operations. The data presented were obtained in the course of all investigation which is now in progress; and it is hoped that a discussion of the methods of attack used, and some of the results obtained, may stimulate interest and cooperative effort to the end that drilling muds can be developed which will be superior to those now in general use. For convenience, this report is divided into two parts: the first dealing with the flow characteristics of muds; and the second with the performance of muds when circulated against artificially-prepared formations under conditions simulating those that exist in actual drilling operations.FLOW CHARACTERISTICS OF DRILLING MUDSThe flow characteristics of muds are of importance in that they influence not only the suspension and release of cuttings from the mud, but also the circulation rates attainable. It is generally assumed that rotary muds behave as plastics when subjected to shearing stresses. The accepted theory of plastic flow, which has been developed largely by Bingham,1astates that the stress required to shear such a material is a straight-line function of the velocity gradient. The intercept of this line on the shearing stress axis is known as the yield point; while its slope, the counterpart of viscosity in fluids, will, for lack of a better term, be designated as the immobility (the reciprocal of Bingham's mobility ).",,American Petroleum Institute

March(Shell Oil Co.),,,,,,API-35-034,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Effects on the fluid-circulating systems of drilling wells produced by substituting full-hole for regular tool joints are discussed. The test data introduced compare 'use of the two types of joints in drilling strings of the 4 1/2-in. and 5 9/16-in. A.P.I. sizes. Results show that resistances are materially reduced by using full-hole joints. The advantages, either in the form of lower pumping pressures and reduced power costs, or in the form of increased circulation rates, are graphically indicated.Purpose of PaperThe full-hole Joint has been, in general, accepted by the industry as an improvement over the regular joint, and its future use is apparently assured. However, some of the advantages ascribed to the full-hole joint have ,been accepted either on the basis of theoretical considerations' or on the -basis of limited tests, and more definite information is desirable for determining the actual economies which may be realized. This is particularly true regarding differences in rates of flow and pumping pressures effected by using full-hole joints, and regarding corollary effects on drilling rates and costs. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of tests conducted to obtain comparable flow data under average field conditions which, it is hoped, will be of value to others in determining policies of tool joint replacement during the transition period while stocks of regular joints are still available at lower cost than full-hole joints.Test ConditionsIn obtaining data for both the full-hole and regular tool joints of '4 1/2- and 5 9/16-in. size, the procedure was simply to gage rates of flow and record pump pressures at several depths, with each of the four drilling strings used. For brevity, the test conditions are summarized in Table 1. In testing the 4 1/2-in. drill pipe,' the string was first run in the hole to 6,014 ft. of depth and the maximum rate of flow was maintained for 20 min., during which time mud pressures were recorded, pump strokes counted, and gages taken of the quantity of mud pumped. Observations were also made of the unit weight of the mud, and of its viscosity in centipoises as determined by use of a Stormer viscosimeter run at a constant cup speed of 600 r.p.m. Three other 20min. runs were made at this depth with pumping rates successively decreased until the fourth run, at minimum rate, was completed. The bit was then raised to depths of 4,007 ft. and 1,986 ft., and the same procedure repeated. Finally, a run was made with the drill collar directly connected to the kelly. The string of drill pipe with full-hole joints was then set back into the derrick, and a similar series of observations was made using a 4 1/2-in. string of drill pipe equipped with regular joints. The same bit and the same drill collar were used in testing the two strings. Testing of the 5 9/16-in. drilling strings was carried out in the same manner, care being observed in duplicating conditions. Measurements also were made of the length of pump stroke for each rate of flow, and by this means tank-gage readings for each 20-min.",,American Petroleum Institute
195,320757,,Drilling Barges,G.I. McBride(The Texas Co.),,,,,,API-35-040,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The author describes briefly the construction and operation of seven twin-hull drilling barges used in drilling oil wells in locations where water stands not more than 10 ft. deep. The two hulls of the barges are separated about 8 fl., drilling being carried on between the two hulls which are submerged and rest on bottom during drilling operations. To dale, 25 wells have been drilled with these barges. It is stated that 6 wells call be drilled per year per barge, al a total saving over ordinary pipe-supported structures, of about $600,000 per year.The company with which the author is affiliated expects to realize a net cash saving of $600,000 during the year 1935 with the fleet of seven drilling barges which is now operating in the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The first of these units is now almost three years old; to date 25 wells have been completed in what one might call -marine fashion. It is believed that sufficient information is now available to present a complete picture of these operations. Articles have appeared in oil-field periodicals which have been descriptive, mainly of some of the earlier types of floating drilling barges. No attempt will here be made to describe these to any great extent; while they are satisfactory for certain specialized types of work, we consider them inadequate for customary oil well drilling. In our preliminary plans, originated in the fall of -1931, for the present type of twin-hull drilling barge, it was decided to build the unit of sufficient capacity that it could be sunk solidly upon lake bottom. This type of construction and operation possesses the following decided advantages:It is unaffected by tides, wind, and waves. Considering adequate blowout control, this becomes an important feature.With increasing depth the load on the pipe rack varies, as does also the amount and weight of mud in the ditch and pits. Experience has shown that a slight disturbance of the center of gravity of a floating barge pulls the derrick enormously out of plumb. With submerged barges it is found that the 136-ft. derricks remain truly vertical during all drilling operations.Submergence provides unusual stability, as was proved in a severe hurricane on June 16 of last year. One derrick was blown over; two steel barges carrying a load Of fresh water were blown a mile inland a 30,000bbl. tanker, which had been settled well into the lake bottom as permanent storage, shifted 4 ft. The twin hull drilling barge, less than 2,000 ft. away, did not move (as far as could be determined) a fraction of an inch.So much for the comparison between floating and submersible equipment. The first decision made in the design and construction of our first twin-hull drilling barge was to establish such elements as to what constituted a pipe rack of convenient yet minimum length, what was desirable for a mud ditch, and the size of the slush pit and reserve mud pits.",,American Petroleum Institute

Leonardon(Schlumberger Well Survey Corp. of Texas.),,,,,,API-35-047,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Electrical exploration of drill holes is a recent geophysical technique, reduced to practice only about seven years ago. It is often referred to as the Schlumberger test and sometimes as electrical coring by analogy with mechanical coring. This latter expression, however, is easily confusing in view of the fact that, in technical papers and practice, mechanical coring and electrical measurements are often involved. The terms electrical surveys and electrical logs seem quite adequately to characterize the new process, and their use is advised. &sect;The process is a French invention imported by the Societe de Prospection Electrique, Paris, and discovered and perfected by Messrs. C. and M. Schlumberger and their associates. There is no need to emphasize the absolute necessity of gathering reliable and complete information on all the formations encountered in the course of drilling. From the early days, when drilling relied almost entirely on the driller's feelings, up to the present time, the oil industry has witnessed a continuous improvement in the manner of securing sub-surface information. Drilling- speed charts, driller's logs based on examination of cuttings, mechanical coring, paleontological analysis, wire-line coring, etc.--each furnishes some valuable data. But there is a constant urge to develop new means of investigation for the purpose of reducing the cost of drilling and obtaining, however, more complete and reliable data. Today, electrical measurements constitute a new step forward towards achieving this end. They supplement the other sources of information to a great extent and, in some instances, replace them.ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY OF THE ROCKSAmong the parameters which can be utilized for differentiating geological formations, electrical resistance of the rocks is one of the most efficient, because it varies within large limits from one formation to another. Furthermore, it can be measured easily at depth. We shall recall here that rocks are capable of transmitting the electric current only by means of the absorbed water which they contain. Were they entirely dry, they would be entirely non-conductive. This absorbed water contains dissolved salts, and thus constitutes the electrolyte necessary for the conduction of the, current. The more electrolyte contained in a rock, and the richer this electrolyte is in dissolved salts, the greater is the conductivity of the rock. In practice, the parameter which is measured is not the conductivity, but its reciprocal value-the electrical resistivity. For practical purposes, the resistivity is expressed in ohms per meter-meter square (resistivity of a cube of 1 meter on all sides). This gives figures comprised between one and several thousand ohms, according to the constitution of the rocks. If a rock is very compact, the quantity of moisture it contains is exceedingly small and, consequently, the resistivity is high. This is true for dense and massive hard rocks like granite, quartzite, gneiss, and marble. Among the softer rocks, gypsum, rock salt, and coal are also very resistant on account of their minute water content. The unconsolidated formations are generally rich in water, and normally possess good electrical conductivity. It is necessary, however, to establish a definite distinction among the pervious and the impervious soft rocks.",,American Petroleum Institute
197,320759,,Value of Oil-Well Surveying and Applications of Controlled Directional Drilling,James D. Hughes(Eastman Oil Well Survey Co.),,,,,,API-35-060,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The author first discusses briefly the value of constant surveys to determine verticality of well bore; then discusses controlled directional drilling, how accomplished, and where used.The purpose of this paper is to bring out the importance of well surveying and the economic applications of directional drilling. In fact, the two are so closely related that to discuss one necessarily includes the other. Years ago, the only persons giving much thought to the verticality of oil wells were the geologists who were sometimes distressed over the lack of uniform correlation, and production men who reasoned that the excessive weal on rods and tubing might possibly be due to their being in a crooked hole. This, added to some spectacular twist-offs and other drilling worries, resulted in an extensive engineering study, of crooked holes and their causes, which in turn led to the now almost universal practice of conducting some type of verticality surveys during the course of drilling. The objective is now a vertical hole. Until recently, the only economical means of judging the degree of verticality has been through the use of such recording methods as the acid bottle, the ink syphon, and a number of plumb-bob devices which pricked on a concentrically-ringed disc the number of degrees a well was off vertical. A well that remained within 3 deg. was, and is now, considered a reasonably vertical hole; if over 3 deg., it was probably plugged back to the point of excessive deflection and straightened. The angle at which a well is drilling is most often regarded more as a figure, a quantity to stay within, like the red line on the weight indicator, and not in its trigonometric sense where the degree of inclination is directly related to the number of feet the bottom of the hole will be away from the center of the derrick on the ground. Not a great many people have taken time to figure that a well which is within 2 deg. or 3 deg. of vertical for 5,000 ft. can have its bottom from 175 ft. to 261 ft. away from the point where it was spudded in at the surface. The earlier surveying methods failed to show these facts. The operator had no indication of the direction; he had only an unrelated quantitative measure. The deviation as indicated by this series of vertical angles might be cumulative in any direction along a line radial from the derrick; it might be along a spiral, or it might reverse upon itself; the actual course of the hole was impossible to determine without elaborate orientation of the drill pipe. That holes do so wander around is common knowledge, and has in the past been illustrated by such competent observers as Lahee, Anderson, Judson and Murphy, and many others. Directional surveys were mostly taken after the well had reached its total depth; and besides being rather expensive, the survey showed only the results of the drilling operations. Without using this expensive method from time to time during the course of drilling, the final location of the bottom came as a surprise, and often an unpleasant one.",,American Petroleum Institute
198,320760,,Paraffin Production Problems,C.E. Reistle Jr.(East Texas Engineering Association),,,,,,API-35-072,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"INTRODUCTIONOne of the problems often encountered in the production of paraffin and mixed-base crudes that contain a high percentage of wax is the accumulation of these hydrocarbons, generally called paraffin, in the producing string, flow lines, tank batteries, and in some cases on the face of the sand. In this report the available information on these production problems has been summarized briefly.CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPOSITION OF PARAFFINThe principal constituent of this so-called paraffin is the higher-melting-point waxes found in petroleum. These waxes separate from solution in the crude oil in the form of very fine crystals that tend to agglomerate and form granular particles of wax about the size of ordinary table salt. Deposited paraffin also contains gums, resins, asphaltic material, crude oil, sand silt, and in some instances water in addition to the was crystals. Because the oil gradually sweats or drains from the wax particles, the hardness of the paraffin and the quantity of oil associated with the wax depend upon the length of time during which accumulation has taken place and the manner in which it was deposited. The compositions of several paraffins are given in Table 1. The wax found in paraffin may range from the lowest to the highest melting-point waxes present in the oil. In a laboratory study of paraffins from different fields, waxes were found with melting points ranging from 100 to 191 deg. F.1aThe paraffin accumulations in wells in the same field will differ in percentages of wax of given melting points, since the conditions governing precipitation vary with each individual well.FACTORS GOVERNING THE SOLUBILITY OF PARAFFINThese waxes, gums, resins, and asphaltic material which compose the deposited paraffin are in true solution in the crude oil as it originally exists in the reservoir. If the alteration of certain conditions during the production or transportation destroys this equilibrium of the solution, separation and deposition of these less soluble constituents results. The most important factor affecting the stability of the solution of these constituents in the crude oil is temperature. Natural waxes are soluble in the liquid constituents of crude oil in all proportions, a t their melting-point temperature; however, as the temperature is lowered, the solubility rapidly decreases.1The solubility of several different melting-point waxes in two different crude oils are illustrated by the curves in Fig. l. In most cases crude oil contains only a relatively small quantity of the higher-melting-point waxes, and the temperature of the oil must be lowered appreciably below the normal reservoir temperature before any wax is precipitated from the solution. The reservoir temperature in the East Texas field, for example, is between 140 and 150 deg. F., and wax does not start to separate from the East Texas crude oil until the oil is cooled to a temperature of from 95 to 98 deg. F; However, there are exceptions where wax separates from the oil if it is cooled only a few degrees below the reservoir temperature; the temperature of the Second Wall Creek sand in the Salt Creek field, Wyoming, varies from 103 to 108 deg. F. Was separates from this crude oil when it is cooled to a temperature ranging from 95 to 98 deg. F.",,American Petroleum Institute

Cobberly(KobeInc.),,,,,,API-35-079,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Hydraulic-power transmission, which has been applied in other industries, is adapted 10 oil-well pumping. Oil is used as the hydraulic fluid. The equipment includes means for separating gas, water, and solids from the operating fluid and a pump for supplying fluid under high pressure. The sub-surface unit is a reciprocating engine direct-connected 10 a double-acting reciprocating pump. The unit is carried by a macaroni siring of tubing and inserts within the regular production tubing. High efficiencies and low operating costs are attained. Fluid levels may be determined or automatically controlled.IntroductionHydraulic-power transmission is finding wide application in various industries-particularly in the machine tool industry-where it is desired to obtain large directly-applied forces or a convenient and wide range of speed control. The application to the pumping of oil, which has both of these requirements, seems logical and highly advantageous. The method of power transmissions being used with high efficiency for both shallow and deep production, and may be extended to handle both extremely small or extremely large production from any depth. Hydraulic pumping offers a means for economical lifting of oil under normal conditions, and answers many problems encountered under special conditions. Devices for this purpose may be divided into two general classes:Hydraulic-power heads which are located aboveground and are used to actuate sucker-rod pumps.Hydraulic-power devices which are located below the fluid level in the well and to which power is transmitted by means of a fluid.The first classification includes various forms of machines which utilize hydraulic power, either independently or in combination with pneumatic power, for the purpose of obtaining a long polish-rod stroke and a velocity cycle that will permit a high mean velocity without large acceleration forces. Considerable effort has been directed to developing machines of this type1ain the past, and further work is in progress which it is hoped will result in their commercial application. The second class of devices may be further sub-divided into:Those which transfer energy, by first converting the potential energy of the power fluid into kinetic energy and transferring this energy directly to the pumped fluid as in the ejector, or by means of an intermediate mechanical transfer such as an impulse or reaction turbine motor, direct-connected with a centrifugal or turbine pump.Machines which transfer potential energy of the power fluid to the pumped fluid through the medium of a rotary positive-displacement engine, direct-connected with a rotary positive-displacement pump, or a , reciprocating engine direct-connected with a reciprocating pump.Devices in which the p-hydraulic fluid is a pressure transmitting medium and the pump is made to reciprocate by an intermittent application of pressure to a fluid column or a pair of fluid columns.This paper will not attempt to describe or compare the various means .for utilizing hydraulic transmission of power for the pumping of oil wells, but will be limited to the description and the discussion of one particular type.",,American Petroleum Institute

Robinson(General Petroleum Corp. of California),,,,,,API-35-091,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Regardless of the sometimes regrettable effect upon ultimate recovery, both the character of proration plans in most fields and the absence of proration in other fields generally require pumping at the maximum practicable rate. Maximum production rate is secured by:Deep tubing.Adequate pump capacity.Elimination of free gas from the pump.Low casing head pressure.Minimum lifting cost is secured by:A suitable pumping machine which must be adequately strong, flexible in speed, and high in efficiency as well as moderate in cost.Below-ground equipment and methods of operation which require a minimum of servicing expense both for number of repairs and cost of individual jobs.Power economy and use of prime movers suitable for the location-first cost, operation, and maintenance costs considered.In the absence of curtailment, protection against drainage dictates a policy of pumping at the maximum practical rate; while under curtailment, which is generally based upon potential, ability to demonstrate potential is unfortunately obligatory. Fortunately for ultimate recovery, maximum practical pumping rates are generally less than drastically-curtailed flowing rates were during the early life of the field. Moreover, during the late life of a well, maximum pumping rate increases ultimate recovery by postponing abandonment.A. MAXIMUM PRODUCTION1. Pump DepthLowering tubing always tends to increase production, although there are wells with bad pipe and wells in which troublesome sand conditions are aggravated by increased depth-and in such cases the benefits of deep. tubing cannot be realized. One of the latest tools of the production man is the bottom-hole pressure gage, which makes it possible to evaluate the effect of deep tubing in advance of trial. With the pressure gage, productivity factors are determined. Productivity factor is defined as the number of barrels per day that are produced per pound differential pressure between the formation and the well. Factors range from 0.1 bbl. up to about 10 bbl. per pound of differential. Oil of 30~deg. A.P.I. exerts a pressure of 38 lb. per sq. in. for each' 100 ft. of fluid column, so that each reduction of the fluid level by 100 ft. above the formation will tend to increase production as follows:(mathematical equation available in full paper)As an actual example, in a Los Angeles Basin well the tubing was lowered from 4,576 ft. to 4,606 ft. Production increased from 20 bbl. per day to 80 bbl. per day, a high return for the cost of 30 ft. of tubing and rods. In addition to the direct advantage of deep tubing, lowering will occasionally place the pump below oil froth. Froths are common in the more viscous oils; and, although more unusual, may also be found in wells producing higher gravities. Frothy oil is rarely found near the bottom of a well, but may occur higher up. One of the deeper wells at Santa Fe Springs gave considerable pump trouble and small production at first. Tubing was fairly close to bottom; and, although various combinations of pumps and pumping speeds were tried, production could not be increased.",,American Petroleum Institute

Newcombe(Associated Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-35-097,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The subject of acid treating, or acidation as it is now commonly known, has been broadly discussed numerous times from many angles in both trade journals and technical publications. This paper can, therefore, be little more than a review of its development and use, but will touch upon some of the experiences with acid treatment in Michigan and some of the new experimentation which actual local field conditions has brought about. The development of acid treatment for increasing oil and gas production started in Michigan between four and five years ago by cooperative research of The Pure Oil Company and the Dow Chemical Company. The commercial use of acid treatment: has spread to nearly every field of this country, Canada, and Mexico where the producing horizons are in limestones and dolomitic rocks and to several where reservoir sandstones are held together by calcite or limey cements. The mechanics of acid treating involve three principal factors: 1, the type of acid; 2, the amount of acid; and, 3, the method of introduction into the hole.Type of AcidThe first consideration in choosing the type of acid is the kind chemically that best suits the conditions existent in the producing formation and in the hole. Although it is generally established that hydrochloric (muriatic) acid is most adaptable, a number of other acids, both inorganic and organic, have been considered and tried. The use of sulfuric acid is highly impracticable, because the insoluble calcium sulfate formed in the reaction clogs the producing horizon and closes as many openings as the solvent action forms. Hydrofluoric acid presents practical difficulties in dangers of handling; and the fluorides formed from the reaction, even in small quantities, would be injurious to health. Moreover, the products resulting from its reaction are insoluble in water and in hydrochloric acid, and. gelatinous insoluble salts precipitate out when they come in contact with the calcium and magnesium salts of oilfield brines. For this reason, it is at present considered advisable to limit the amount of hydrofluoric acid used or to restrict treatments containing it to formations in which silicates are but a minor constituent. Nitric acid could be used ill treating wells, but it has several objectionable qualities, and cannot be inhibited against metals because of the liberation of nitrogen dioxide instead of hydrogen. This is a very obnoxious, poisonous, corrosive gas; and, because of being a strong oxidizing agent, mill oxidize ,certain constituents in the crude oil and gum up the pores in the formation. Tests with mixtures of hydrochloric and nitric acids show conclusively that the rate of reaction of the former is not speeded up by the addition of the latter, either with dry or wet dolomite, no matter what the proportions used of each. Although the quickening of the action of hydrochloric acid on dolomite by accessory chemicals is questioned by some of its competing concerns, Dowell, Inc. (Dow Chemical Company) now uses intensified acid for treating dolomitic rocks. This is made by adding chemicals to the regular inhibited hydrochloric-acid solution to give a solution which has a faster rate of reaction with dolomitic limestones.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lacey(California Institude of Technology.),,,,,,API-35-107,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"INTRODUCTIONIn any attack upon the problems presented by the flow of fluids through pipes or porous media, a knowledge of the properties of the fluids involved is a primary requisite. In the case of fluids whose properties undergo large changes during the flowing process, these properties must be known over the ranges of conditions which may be encountered in practice. The properties whose ,values must be measured for this purpose will depend upon the method of attack upon the problem. One method which offers some promise in dealing with the complicated case of the flow of complex mixtures of naturally-occurring hydrocarbons involves the use of those fundamental energy relations which are dealt with in thermodynamics. Properties which appear to be most useful in this connection are specific volume, heat content, and entropy; and they must be known as functions of temperature and pressure throughout the range of conditions likely to be met in field practice. These three properties are well known to engineers dealing with steam-power equipment, compressors, and refrigeration machinery. The work of these men is predicated upon a knowledge of the values of these properties, for the fluids with which they deal, resulting front experimental determinations. The time tried and practically-tested benefits of this method of study can be utilized by the petroleum-production engineer to equal advantage if he has available the results of the proper experimental measurements upon those materials in which he is particularly interested. His situation, however, is complicated by the great variations of composition of these materials, requiring a much greater volume of information than is needed to deal with single or pure substances. It is the purpose of this paper to present some experimental results for a particular case, and to indicate how they may be used to analyze the energy relations involved in flow through the tubing of a producing well. The necessary steps in the investigation include field measurements and procurement of suitable samples, laboratory measurements upon the samples thus obtained, and the necessary calculations based upon both sets of measurements. The field measurements and the sampling for this paper have been carried out through the courtesy of the technical and research department of the Humble Oil and Refining Company under the supervision of T. V. Moore and R. J. Schilthuis. The laboratory studies and calculations have been prosecuted as a part of the work of Research Project 37 of the American Petroleum Institute.Procurement of SampleThe problem of procuring a representative sample of the fluid flowing in the well is not an easy one. One possible method is to take depth or sub-surface samples near the bottom of the well, while another is to obtain the samples at the other end of the system, viz., at the surface. The first method, depth sampling, requires special equipment and technique, and to a certain extent interferes with normal production operations. One of the least satisfactory features, however, is the great difficulty of designing a sampling device which will obtain a representative and useful sample from a me chemical mixture of gas and liquid phases, unless such a mixture is a very intimate one.",,American Petroleum Institute

Barlow(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-35-116,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Bottom-hole pressure measurements are shown to assist in producing crude oil more economically by increasing the ultimate recovery of oil, by decreasing the equipment investment, and by making reserve estimates of oil and gas more reliable. Shut-in bottom-hole pressure measurements have been used to control production of water-drive pools in a planner such that the ultimate recovery is increased and the flowing life lengthened. Pressure measurements make it possible to predict lifting methods and oil and gas reserves on gas-drive pools. The decrease in bottom-hole pressure while wells are being pumped may be used to insure operators that the pumping equipment is suitable to any particular well.The study of bottom-hole pressures has become of increasing importance since its beginning during the last decade. Many instruments have been developed and numerous articles written describing bottom-hole pressure measurements and utilization of this information.1aThe purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the present phases of activity in making bottom-hole pressures useful tools in the production of crude oil. Pressure is the motivating force for the movement of oil into the well, and is the chief regulating condition for the solution of gas in crude oil. Therefore, any measurements of pressure in the process of moving oil and gas mixtures from producing formation to the surface is important information for interpreting the behavior of the mixture of oil and gas in the reservoir and flow string. The statement that the bottom-hole pressure of a well is 500 lb. gives very little information unless one states that this is the maximum pressure a well would reach upon being shut-in, or that the well was being produced at a known rate at the time of the measurement. This pressure also might be taken during the time the pressure in a well is building up to its maximum, and in this case would be useful only as one of the points of a curve showing pressure build-up with time. These three types of bottom-hole pressures will be referred to as shut-in or bottom-hole pressures, flowing pressures, and build-up pressures, respectively. It is always necessary to indicate the level at which the pressure is measured or to which it is referred. The major ways in which bottom-hole pressures assist in producing crude oil more economically are increase in ultimate recovery, decrease in equipment investment, and estimation of oil and gas reserves. The specific applications of bottom-hole-pressure information to these larger problems will be treated in two parts: natural-flowing wells and wells produced by artificial lift.",,American Petroleum Institute

If the problems involved in the process are to be understood, it is necessary that information be had concerning both the physical and energy transformations occurring with changing pressures and temperatures. The laws for perfect gases and solutions are inadequate to express the behavior of oil and gas under high pressure. At the present time insufficient fundamental data are available to permit prediction, with certainty, of the physical changes which complex hydrocarbon mixtures undergo in high-pressure oil and gas reservoirs. In spite of the lack of fundamental data, it seems that one approach to the problem is through the examination of samples of the oil and/or gas secured in as near their original condition as possible. Apparatus designed to obtain such samples from within wells, and to examine them in the laboratory, is described. The technique involved in the examination and the type of data which may be obtained are discussed.Many production problems, particularly those concerned with the flow of oil and gas through the reservoir to the wells, through the well bores to the surface, and the transportation of oil and gas on the surface, require for their solution a knowledge of both the physical transformations and energy changes occurring with changing pressures and temperatures. Such information is also essential in the study of problems dealing with the prediction of reservoir-pressure decline, the effect of rate of production upon rate of reservoir-pressure decline, the efficiency of reservoir-energy utilization, the estimation of underground reserves, production methods for very high-pressure reservoirs where the pressures and temperatures encountered are likely to be higher than the critical pressures and temperatures of the hydrocarbon mixtures contained therein, extraction of natural gasoline, and related problems. The study of problems involving the performance of oil and gas reservoirs is usually hampered by a lack of proper information concerning the physical nature and behavior of the fluids contained therein under the high pressures encountered. With the development of instruments for measuring sub-surface pressures, much information has been collected during the past three or four years on the operation of a number of oil and gas reservoirs. Although these data have been of considerable interest and value, it has been difficult in most instances to utilize them to the fullest extent on account of the limited knowledge having to do with the behavior of complex hydrocarbon mixtures under the high pressures encountered in the reservoirs. It is well known that the laws for perfect gases and perfect solutions, without modification, do not adequately express the behavior of oil and/or gas mixtures, even at moderately high pressures. Much valuable work of a fundamental nature has been done, and is now in progress, to investigate the properties of both pure hydrocarbons, and mixtures of hydrocarbons and to devise methods of expressing their deviations from the laws for ideal gases and solutions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Garrison(Rice Institute),,,,,,API-35-130,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Recent investigations in the field of colloid chemistry have made it possible to state, with some certainty, the magnitude of the interfacial or film forces acting within the capillary spaces of reservoir rock. A review of the literature leading to this information is presented. The effect of these interfacial forces on the distribution of oil and water in porous material is shown. Phases of the problem bearing on current ideas of production economy and effective recovery are discussed. It is concluded that oil and water cannot separate completely into layers in the reservoir, but must set up a definite equilibrium in which waterfalls all the pores having sizes below a certain magnitude. This critical size depends on chemical nature, on elevation, and on the, physical constants of the oil and water. In order that a well shall produce nothing but oil, it is necessary that the oil flow to the well bore through the larger pores at such a rate that it does not cause the water to advance from its equilibrium position in the smaller capillaries to a point where it is forced along with the oil. It is shown that the advancing position of the water into the larger capillaries and, thus, into a position where it is more likely to be transported along with the oil is dependent on: the interfacial tension of the oil-water contact, the wettability of the reservoir materials by water and oil, the relative densities of the liquids, the elevation, as well as the shape and dimensions of the pores. It is shown that a high rate of production causes the water to move from its static equilibrium position to a new position where larger pores formerly occupied by oil are filled with water. This conception of water as a network of capillaries in equilibrium with the oil throughout the reservoir is contrasted with that of definite levels of oil-water contact connoted in the terms, edge water, coning, or nosing of water.INTRODUCTIONThe surface tension of a liquid is a measure of the tensile strength of its surface film. It is expressed in dynes per centimeter length of the film. The interfacial tension between two liquids is likewise the tensile strength of the films separating the liquids, and is also expressed in dynes per centimeter length.

The data presented can be used to illustrate the changes in fluid volume and to indicate what volume a unit quantity of crude oil at the surface of the ground and the gas produced with it most probably occupied in the sands of the oil formation. Corresponding values for the solubility of the gas in the oil are also included. Experimental determinations of the viscosity of the liquid portion of these same mixtures have been made throughout the same ranges of temperature and pressure.A knowledge of the volume occupied by oil and gas under the conditions existing in the sands of producing oil pools has a number of possible applications in connection with the major problems facing the production engineer. Notable examples of such problems are those of estimation of reserves underground and of proration of the production from different properties in the same pool. The viscosity of the liquid phase, under the conditions prevailing in the sands, has important bearing upon the mobility of the oil toward the well. Experimental studies related to these subjects are here presented for the case of oil and gas from Dominguez field in California. The term formation volume as used in this paper refers to the volume in cubic feet occupied by one cubic foot of oil (as measured at the surface at 60 deg. F. and at 14.73 lb. per sq. in., absolute) and the corresponding amount of gas to give a specified gas-oil ratio, when they have been brought to equilibrium at a specified temperature and pressure. Gas-oil ratios are given in terms of the cubic feet of gas associated with one barrel of oil, both the gas and the oil being measured at 60 deg. F. and at 14.73 lb. per sq. in., absolutely. The ranges of equilibrium temperatures and pressures used in the study were chosen to cover those most likely to be met in producing sands. The temperature has been varied from 70 deg. F. to 220 deg.

The samples of oil and gas used for the investigation were obtained from the surface traps of a well producing from the fifth Callendar zone. Gas samples were obtained from both the high-pressure and atmospheric traps, and were then blended in the same proportion as produced to give a composite sample corresponding to the total gas production of the well at the time of sampling.

FLetcher(Hughes Tool Co.),,,,,,API-35-150,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Early rotary wells were drilled with low-carbon lap-welded drill stem; and difficulties arising from cross-threading, galling, rapid thread wear, and slow handling forced the development of the rotary tool joint-while increasing loads encountered, as well depths increased, led to the introduction of medium-carbon seamless drill pipe with heavy upset and special thread form, together with heat-treated alloy joints. Recent changes in drilling practice adopted to decrease deviation of hole from vertical have emphasized certain factors which cause types of failure not previously general. The apparently simple drill-stem structure contains complicated design. problems not susceptible of exact mathematical solution. The, predominating type of failure is definitely fatigue, possibly accelerated by corrosion. Vibration, both torsional and transverse, is prob. ably the principal destructive factor. Marked reduction of failures through metallurgical improvement is at present unlikely in the light of present knowledge. Some advantage may be secured through changes of design although only by sacrifice in other directions, at the present less important. Much can be accomplished by greater care in the use of drill stem with special attention to those factors influenced by light weight and high rotative speed.HistoryThe drill stem used with rotary rigs, from the first application of the rotary system to the drilling of oil wells in about 1900 to the introduction of the Whittier tool joint about 1910, consisted of low-carbon lap-welded line pipe joined with rather short couplings of a similar material. Wells were relatively shallow, and the use of the rotary was limited to regions of unconsolidated formations-under which conditions fairly satisfactory performance was possible with a stem of this character. The Whittier tool joint was developed in an effort, to eliminate galling difficulties encountered in making up and breaking out the somewhat delicate pipe threads, and to reduce the labor involved of screwing up the joint when going into the hole. Early tool joints were made of machinery steel unheat-treated; and in spite of the coarser threads employed in the pin and box, still gave some trouble from galling. In addition, jumped pins were not uncommon, and thread damage during stabbing was encountered. Some decrease in the galling difficulty was accomplished by cyaniding the threads of the pin, leaving the box threads soft. The combination of the shoulder with the tapered thread, similar to the cable-tool joint, very materially increased the difficulty of making interchangeable joints; and in an effort to solve this problem, the Hickman joint was introduced in North Texas and Louisiana. This joint consisted of a coarse-threaded, steep-tapered pin and box, but without a shoulder-and while readily interchangeable, gave so much trouble from galling, it was eventually abandoned. The Acme form of thread was introduced for use in tool joints in 1918, and at the same time a heat-treated alloy steel was used with much higher physical properties than formerly employed and less subject to galling. The Acme form of thread is well adapted to resist the impact resulting from stabbing the pin in the box, and has a greater amount of metal available to resist wear above the pitch line than is the case with the V-thread.",,American Petroleum Institute

Graham(Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-35-162,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The first form of rotary drill pipe was welded merchant pipe, but early in the use of this system merchant pipe was replaced by seamless tubes. The introduction of seamless tubes was followed in rapid steps by increasing carbon content and tensile strength, concurrent with interior upsetting. Upsetting introduced weaknesses which can be eliminated by full length normalizing of the drill-pipe tube. The threaded connection of drill pipe to tool joint is responsible for many failures, in that the thread acts as a notch in the root of which a crack progressively deepens under conditions of corrosive fatigue. This type of failure can be overcome by eliminating the threaded connection by forging an upset on the drill pipe to act as a tool joint.IntroductionAt few places in all the manifold activities of modern industry is there to be found a tool upon which so much depends as upon rotary drill pipe in modern deep-well oil production. Drill pipe is at once a hazard to the well driller and a problem to the steel maker. To drilling crews who struggle turn after turn in fishing for a broken stem, it may seem a rather remote fact that in steel mills- thousands of miles away engineers, steel makers, and metallurgists have been engaged for years in a struggle to improve the mechanical and metallurgical features of drill pipe. Such a struggle is, however, on; and it will be continued until a point is reached where drill pipe can be used, under proper operating conditions, for a period of long service life, with twist offs reduced to the point of rare instances.Early HistoryBefore beginning an account of the present-day status of this struggle for better drill pipe, we shall very briefly review the early types of pipe used in this method of drilling. When rotary drilling was originally devised, supposedly the pipe first used was that form of pipe easily available; i.e., some small diameter of welded steel pipe, probably butt-welded, and perhaps of bessemer steel (see Fig. 1). Probably wrought iron was also used in some of the first instances of rotary drilling, or at least we have been so informed (see Fig. 2). Very early in working out the rotary method of drilling, the benefits of larger diameters must have been recognized; and the use of such diameters must have extended into the field of lap-welded open-hearth steel (see Fig. 3). The welding method of manufacturing pipe necessitated low-carbon contents, which means that the early rotary drill pipe was of this analysis. When the seamless or piercing method of making pipe was introduced, the low-carbon analysis was at first still adhered to (see Fig. 4); but failures in drilling and greater depths of hole brought recognition of the possibilities of the seamless method for making drill pipe of higher carbon content and, consequently, of greater strength (see Fig. 5). Concurrently with this change in analysis and method of manufacture, there was proceeding a development in method of coupling.",,American Petroleum Institute

The authors present a formula, including an alignment chart for graphical solution, for determining the work done by drilling lines in terms of ton-miles. Tabular values of drill-pipe weights and similar variables are given, followed by a discussion of safety factors, line speed, loading, methods of attaching rope to drums, drum sizes, lubrication, etc. A chart shows graphically the service due to drill-pipe movements .while drilling; another chart provides a method whereby rotary-drilling lines may be retired from service as based on amount of wear and number of broken wires. A table is included showing a summary of operating conditions based upon replies to a questionnaire.Rotary-drilling lines have been developed, with respect to grade of material and construction, to such an extent as to assure reasonably uniform performance under normal operating conditions. And yet-mostly due to the extremely complex and variable nature of static and dynamic forces involved, and partly due to the lack of a uniform system of evaluating same-the available service records have been very erratic, and the results most inconsistent. This subject is now being reviewed in order to correlate, if possible, the various forms now in use, and to recommend a uniform system for evaluating drilling-line service. It is not expected, of course, that every wire-rope user will find it expedient to keep field-service records; neither do we believe it practical to formulate all the forces to which rotary-drilling lines are subjected in the course of drilling an oil well. All that it is hoped to accomplish is that, when and if service records are kept, standard forms will be followed in order that the information so obtained may permit reasonably fair comparison. As a basis for this work, a questionnaire was forwarded to a representative group of wire-rope manufacturers and users. A summary of the questionnaire is appended hereto as Exhibit A. In answering the questionnaire, practically all operators expressed a desire to have a uniform system established. It also became apparent that, with the exception of three operators who use footage drilled as a yardstick for evaluating the line service, all others keeping service records are using the Anderson ton-mile formula or a modified form thereof. We see no reason why footage drilled should not prove a suitable unit in drilling shallow wells in familiar territory, with standardized equipment and uniform drilling methods. Obviously, however, the system is inadequate to meet general drilling conditions. The Anderson formula,&sect; as introduced by H. H. Anderson, of the Shell Oil Company, deals with static loads only. The work performed by the drilling line is expressed in formula (1), where:(mathematical equation available in full paper)By assigning the proper figures for weight and length and dividing by 2, the above formula will express the work done in setting casings. The application of this formula and the underlying principles have been generally accepted by the industry, and any modification or simplification adopted or proposed by individual operators has been in the nature of assigning empirical values to certain indeterminate factors-or an attempt to simplify field and office work.",,American Petroleum Institute

Flaherty(Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-35-190,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The manufacture of steel begins with iron making, which consists of reduction of the iron-oxide ores into metallic iron containing as impurities an appreciable percentage of metalloids. The steel making proper involves the oxidation of the metalloid impurities, the greatest possible degree of elimination of the resulting oxides, and the adjustment of the carbon content and the alloying of added elements with the steel to produce in the finished product the required characteristics. The characteristics of steel are a function of the behavior of carbon and other elements with respect to the various allotropic forms of iron under various thermal conditions. This behavior results in varied characteristics evident in the size and distribution of various phases and constituents in a microstructure. These characteristics, in turn, impart physical properties measurable in terms of strength, ductility, hardness, and similar standards.1. BLAST-FURNACE PIG IRONThe occurrence in nature of pure iron as a metal is a rarity of little commercial significance. Iron occurs, however, in great profusion as ores, high in iron-oxide contents. The extraction of iron from these ores consists primarily in the reduction of these oxides to metallic iron, using carbon in the form of coke as fuel and reducing element, and limestone as a flux to slag off impurities. The reduction process is carried on in the blast furnace. The typical furnace (Fig. 1) is a vertical, roughly-cylindrical shaft about 90 ft. high, which is about three quarters filled with alternating layers of ore, limestone, and coke, and through which is blown a blast of air preheated in stoves to a temperature of 900-1,200 deg. F. (482-650 deg. C.), and at a pressure of 18 lb. per sq. in. A region' near the bottom, called the hearth, attains a temperature of about 2,700-2,800 deg. F. (1,482-1,538 deg. C.), and here the reduction is completed., About 200 tons of iron and 125 tons of slag are drawn off through an opening at the bottom of the furnace about every five (5) hours. The liquid iron is then cast in the form of pigs for charging cold into open-hearth or foundry furnaces, or taken to mixers- where it is stored in a molten state pending charging into the open-hearth furnace or bessemer converter.Blast-Furnace Plant. FIG. 1(available in full paper)Grades of Pig IronIt should be appreciated that blast-furnace iron is, in practically all cases, an intermediate product composed of about 93 per cent iron and 7 Per cent metalloids and impurities. This 7 per cent must be cut down by oxidation and fluxing to meet the ordinary specifications for steel products. Depending on analysis of ore burden, there are, in general, three types of steel-making iron produced in American blast furnaces, as shown in Table 1.Quality of Pig IronOld as the blast-furnace process is, there is still considerable speculation as to the exact mechanism of the chemical, physic-chemical, and thermal reactions that take place in the furnace. It is generally recognized, however, that control of the slag is of major importance in controlling not only the quality of the iron, but also the operation of the furnace.",,American Petroleum Institute

Davenport(United State Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-35-209,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The elements of the metallurgy of alloy steels are discussed 'briefly, in as simple terms as possible. Technical terms are defined in the text, and heat-treating terms are defined in an appendix. The author believes that there are a small number of fairly simple basic principles which determine the behavior and properties of any steel, and that a proper grasp of these principles is necessary if steels are to be selected and used intelligently over the very wide range of conditions of actual service. The most important of these principles are outlined and illustrated; few specific applications are mentioned, although it is hoped that the discussion will be found applicable to some of the current metallurgical problems of the industry.INTRODUCTIONIn common with most of our basic industries, the petroleum industry is a large consumer of steel; perhaps, on a tonnage basis, next in importance only to the automobile and railroad industries. Steel is, without doubt, the industry's most important structural material, and there is no phase of the vast and manifold activities involved in petroleum technology in which ferrous alloys in one form or another do not play a vital part. The growth and development of petroleum technology has been rapid, particularly since the invention of the internal-combustion engine and the exploitation of the motor car. The crude equipment of the early days was soon found inadequate for the demands put upon it, and the introduction of iron and steel structures began at an early date. Plain-carbon steel, in its various grades, was employed during this period-largely because it was the only material of its kind economically available in the tonnages required. With the rapid expansion of the automotive industry a corresponding development occurred in petroleum technology; the increased demand for motor fuels and lubricants led to the drilling of deeper and deeper wells and the opening up of new oil fields-involving, in many locations, corrosive, briny waters and the more corrosive sour crudes. At about the same time refinery methods were undergoing radical changes as a result of the development of various cracking processes, practically all of which employ either higher operating temperatures ,or pressures than previously had been found necessary. This trend toward increasingly severe operating conditions, in both the production and refining divisions of the industry, soon began to tax the capacity of plain-carbon- steel equipment and to reveal its inherent limitations. The drilling of deeper wells demanded higher strength steels capable of being used in lighter sections with resultant saving in weight; the sour crudes and corrosive brines required materials with increased resistance to corrosion for both production and refinery equipment; increased temperatures and pressures in distillation processes demanded structural materials which possessed not only increased resistance to oxidation and corrosion, but improved strength and resistance to creep at elevated temperatures. Hence, for the past several years the engineers and metallurgists of the petroleum industry have been searching for; and adopting, structural materials which are better suited to modern operating conditions than carbon steel.",,American Petroleum Institute

Byers Co.),,,,,,API-35-226,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"The advance in the manufacture of wrought iron from its beginning thousands of years ago up to the present time is traced. Numerous changes and developments have occurred during this time, hut the product has consistently Maintained certain fundamental properties. Purity of base metal, and more particularly the inclusion within this matrix of an iron-silicate slag, have been basic characteristics of wrought iron in contrast with other ferrous-metal products. To this slag is ascribed a retarding influence to the direct progress of corrosion, and an ability to lower stress concentration and obstruct the path of incipient fatigue failure. The properties and present-day production methods are discussed in detail. There has been much effort expended to meet the economic aspects of competition and to bring about expansion in variety of marketable products. This effort has been applied mainly along the line of so-called mechanical puddling. A brief description of this process, which has had a large commercial development, is given. All that was characteristic of wrought iron quality has been preserved in the newer developments, and the horizon of adaptability has been greatly extended through diversification-both in composition and nature of finished products.IntroductionThe particular purpose and scope of this article is to convey to the reader the place of wrought iron in contemporary engineering. However, this material has been inter-linked with the entire history of the development of the ferrous-metal industry, and a presentation of the highlights in this development will serve to give a proper perspective of events leading to the situation with respect to wrought iron as it exists today. From earliest times, antedating the Christian era by some thousands of years, iron has had a place in the pursuits of man. The characteristics demanded were entirely, and have remained dominantly, those of forge ability and ductility of product. For thousands of years of primitive production, the need was satisfied by direct reduction from the ore in a single stage, at temperatures well below fusion of the product. The material conformed in all essential particulars to that which now has a definite metallurgical classification as wrought iron. From such methods came the noted Pillar of Pelhi and the numerous iron instruments, tools, and weapons linked with the history of Greece, Egypt, India, and early centers of civilization in Europe and Asia. The growth of the iron industry from these beginnings has been marked by steady evolutionary progress in production and in enhancement of quality and physical properties, punctuated by revolutionary developments which have upset the old order of production. One reads of the Catalan forge, the Lancashire hearth, the loup furnace, and the bloomery fire in the intervening era. In 1784 Cort's invention of the puddling process was a noteworthy milestone of progress. It placed the refining of the relatively-crude cast iron of the blast furnace, which had up to that time a quite narrow field of utilization, on a plane which enabled vast extension of the iron industry. It was a two-stage operation-a forerunner in this respect of modern steel making which made possible the use of coal as a fuel, divorced the industry from dependence upon charcoal, and served to place England in the dominant place in the field of manufacture.",,American Petroleum Institute
214,320775,,Corrosion Fatigue of Drill Pipe,F.N. Speller(National Tube Co.),,,,,,API-35-229,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Drill-pipe failures that have been recognized as primarily due to corrosion are a relatively rare occurrence compared with failures front other causes; but occasional cases have been found where corrosion, associated with stress, was the controlling factor. These cases require explanation. It has been proved that the so-called fatigue limit of metal is materially reduced by even a small amount of localized corrosion; so that if this factor is not brought under control, high-tensile steels that normally have a relatively high-endurance limit may fatigue, under the simultaneous action of corrosion and stress, almost as rapidly as steel with lower tensile strength. The water used in making drilling mud is by itself usually corrosive--especially when aerated; and, therefore,' it seemed that the, answer to this problem should be found in a study of variations in mud-laden fluids from the standpoint of corrosion. The present investigation was initiated as a result of the exceptionally short life of 4 1/2-in. grade D seamless drill pipe experienced on one of the properties of the Sun Oil Company at Barbers Hill, Tex. This appeared to be due to corrosion fatigue. The experimental laboratory work referred to in this paper points to mud conditioning as the most promising means of protecting drill pipe against corrosion fatigue. The more important factors involved are discussed briefly, with suggestions for further work that should be done and tentative recommendations for the treatment of mud when corrosive conditions are anticipated or encountered.MECHANISM OF CORROSIONCorrosion, in general, is the result of reaction between the metal and its environment. The mechanism of corrosion is usually electrochemical. Without going into technical details, it may be said that, in general, corrosion of metals in the presence of water involves two principal chemical reactions:The solution of a small portion of the metal in water accompanied by a proportional deposit of hydrogen on cathodic areas, which tends to stop the reaction by polarizing the couple. The driving force that governs the rate of this initial reaction, or tendency to corrode, is the effective electrical potential of the metal to the solution. This effective potential varies with a number of factors having to do with the environment, particularly the concentration of ions in the solution, and any external electromotive force impressed on the system.The removal of the hydrogen film by: a, oxidation or depolarization; or, b, its removal as bubbles of gas. These open the way for reaction (1) to continue. In the absence of free oxygen or other oxidizing agencies, the initial reaction in solutions that are not decidedly acid is soon stifled by polarization before any considerable damage is done.Protective films and other factors listed on the right hand side of Table 2 play an important part in determining the actual and relative rate of corrosion and the distribution of the attack on the metal-and, as a rule, have much more influence on the course of corrosion than the initial driving force that causes the metal to enter solution.",,American Petroleum Institute
215,320776,,The Degrees of Reduction and Volatility as Indices of Source Beds,Parker D. Trask(U.S. Geological Survey)|Harald E. Hammar(Research Associate American Petroleum Institute.),,,,,,API-35-250,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1935,"Petroleum is composed of compounds that are highly reduced and rich in volatile matter. It would, therefore, seem as if the organic substances of sediments that generate oil similarly would be characterized by reduced and volatile constituents. Consequently, it is possible that the source sediments, even though they already have generated oil, may still retain some indication of their once having contained relatively large quantities of reduced and volatile organic substances. In order, to ascertain the extent to which this hypothesis may be true, the degrees of reduction and volatility, of a large number of Cretaceous sediments in several oil-producing and barren areas in Wyoming and Colorado were investigated. The measure of the degree of reduction that was used is the ratio of the organic-carbon content of the sediments to the quantity of chromic acid of given strength that can be reduced by a standard quantity of sediment. The lower this ratio is, the greater is the degree of reduction. The ratio of the nitrogen content to the quantity of chromic acid that is reduced by the sediment was also used to indicate the degree of reduction. The ratio of nitrogen to the reducing power of sediments is determined more readily, and with greater reliability, than the preceding ratio; but it is a less satisfactory index of the degree of reduction, as nitrogen is a less reliable index of the organic content of sediments than carbon. The degree of volatility is measured b)' the ratio of the assay number to the quantity of chromic acid that is reduced. The larger this ratio is, the greater the degree of volatility. The assay number is a quantitative measure of the tarry material that condenses on the wall of a narrow test tube when a standard quantity, of sediment is heated. The problem of ascertaining the relationship of the degrees of reduction and volatility to source beds is handicapped by inadequate knowledge of the nature of oil-generating rocks. In the present work the assumption has been made, however, that sediments associated with oil zones are likely to be source beds. This assumption, of course, is by no means invariably true; as oil under some conditions may migrate a considerable distance before being trapped, am the beds directly associated with it may not have generated any oil. Accordingly, even though a particular characteristic of sediments, such as the degree of reduction, may actually be an indication of source beds, it will not everywhere be associated with oil or gas in adjacent zones. Consequently, in an empirical study of an oil area, a number of places may be found where the relationships do not hold. Such, indeed, is true in Wyoming and Colorado where oil in Cretaceous beds-in many but not all places-is associated with sediments having relatively high degrees of reduction and volatility. The preponderance of places in which these relationships do hold over those in which they fail, however, seems sufficiently great to indicate that there is a fairly good chance that the relationships are real.",,American Petroleum Institute
216,320777,,Use of Recording Pressure Gages in Drill-Stem Tests,R.S. Christie(Amerada Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-36-008,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"The author defines briefly the drill-stem test, emphasizing the importance of obtaining a pressure record when making this test, and discusses at length the interpretation of records m obtained.A drill-stem test may be made to obtain indications of the potentialities of a suspected oil or gas sand, to test for water shut-off after cementing pipe or to determine the casing point in a known producing horizon. The drill-stem test is obtained by running, on the bottom of the drill pipe, a valve which can be opened and closed from the surface. All the formations in the hole are packed off with the exception of that section of the hole to be tested. The drill pipe is run into the hole with the testing-tool valve closed. After the packer has been set, the valve is opened; and liquid or gas at the testing point enters the drill pipe. In all cases the success of the test depends on the successful operation of the testing tool. Whether or not the valve functions properly can be quite positively determined on the surface for shallower wells, but becomes less positive with increasing depth. It is important to obtain as much information as possible on each test. In a test for water shut-off there is little or no open hole below the casing in the well close to the point of testing and, consequently, small hazard. On the other hand, a formation test or casing-point test is usually made with several hundred feet of open hole, with resultant danger of sticking the drill pipe by settling cuttings or caving. If it becomes necessary to run the test several times, the walls may be weakened and cause trouble when drilling is resumed. A record of the changes in pressure below the testing tool will make more positive the information ordinarily obtained by such a test, and frequently give information that could not otherwise be obtained. A recording pressure gage can be placed into a special container, which can be a part of the anchor of the testing tool. Fig. 1 shows one type of container.Purpose of TestThe primary purpose of a drill-stem test is to determine whether a given formation contains gas, oil, or water. The test may give negative results in the face of other positive indications. This is particularly true in deep holes, as it is not always possible to ascertain whether the packer is holding and the valve functioning properly. When the valve is opened and the fluid does not lower appreciably at the top of the hole, it is assumed the test is successful; but this is not always true, because the fluid may drop due to leaky tool joints or because of loss into some formation, or may fluctuate due to gas or air pockets-all despite the fact that the packer may have held and the valve opened to give a test. To eliminate any doubt as to the mechanical operations of the tester, a recording pressure gags below the tester will record differences in pressures occasioned by the operation of the tester.",,American Petroleum Institute

Barnes(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-36-191,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"Prefacing his paper with a brief statement regarding the application of porosity, saturation, and permeability tests of cores to old and new fields, the author describes the taking of cores; then describes various methods of laboratory analysis, identifying the retort method as the preferred method for making saturation tests. Several methods for determining. porosity are described; typical calculations are included, with comments on interpretation of results.The widespread interest in, and the increased use of various physical tests made on oil-sand cores in the past few years has arisen chiefly through the wider application of secondary recovery methods, and in the more careful attention given to obtaining basic data for use in various oil-production problems in the flushfield category. Considering the secondary recovery methods, since the advent of five-spot water-flood development in the shallow Mid Continent fields about two years ago, it is today an established practice to drill exploratory holes to core the oil sand at key locations on a property and to analyze the core for oil content, porosity, and permeability. The future development of the property in large part is predicated on the values obtained, as the calculations on probable future profits, the engineering data to judge well spacings, pressure plant needs, and water demands, all originate from the core tests. Later, during development, more wells are cored-usually not less than 1 to 40 acres, and often closer-to supply more data and to permit closer scrutiny of the immediate area. This procedure likewise is commonly followed in gas-repressuring work of the pattern type where close well spacings are used. Porosity and saturation tests enter into such flushfield problems as the estimation of oil reserves, porosity for calculating gas reserve, saturation tests in detecting productive oil sands in wildcatting, and in the determination of casing points and water levels. The common core tests are porosity, saturation, and permeability. The unit value of permeability, the darcy, and the test procedure, apparatuses and calculation are well known, due to the efforts of members of the American Petroleum Institute, several colleges and universities, and various oil companies. Much of the recent scientific work on permeability has been specifically devoted to oil sands. In contradistinction, the development of porosity methods has originated as much in other industrial fields as in the oil- and gas-production industry. These porosity methods have all more or less been adapted to the work on oil sands, with both satisfactory and unsatisfactory results. In regard to porosity, this paper will in part set forth the results and experiences of various laboratories in testing Mid Continent sands, and give the specific details of several proven test methods, rather than to present ally basically new methods. The paper likewise will have the same purpose in the discussion of saturation tests, and for both tests is a continuation of the work of the Mid Continent Sub-committee on Saturation Tests, of the Institute's Topical Committee on Production Technology. This sub-committee, appointed in 1935, has published two reports of its work to date.1a,2",,American Petroleum Institute
218,320779,,Tests Indicate Sucker-Rod Loads May Be Reduced,J.F. Eaton(Jarecki Afanufacturing Co.),,,,,,API-36-234,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"Economic factors in the production of many wells by the walking-bean pumping method often require the sucker rods to be so highly stressed that almost no safety factor over their endurance limit is allowed, and an excessively high rate of failure results. By floating the rods on rubber cushions, the author effected a reduction in polished-rod load and, hence, a reduction in rod stress, without sacrificing production. The author infers that further reductions in rod stress might be obtained, without reducing pumping speed or length of stroke, if polished-rod motion could be made independent of walking-beam motion, and if polished-rock velocity could vary inversely as the rod load.INTRODUCTIONThe maximum depth from which oil may be lifted by the sucker-rod pumping method is limited by the maximum allowable .working stress in the sucker rods. In pumping very deep wells, or in Producing large volumes of fluid from moderate depths, this maximum allowable working or fatigue stress may be reached before the rate of production of oil is sufficient to make operation of the well profitable, or even to Pay lifting costs. Although the fatigue limit of sucker rods has been considerably increased, and remarkable performance attained by the application of special alloy rods to meet individual pumping conditions, it remains a fact that, in many Mid Continent fields, sucker rods are operated above their maximum allowable fatigue limit. This condition must exist in order to produce enough oil to pay operating costs, and the resulting excessive rod breakage is to be expected. The present practice in some fields of computing daily allowable production from the results of a potential test requires sucker rods to operate almost at the breaking point during the test. It is a well-known fact that sucker-rod loads and, hence, rod failures can be reduced by reducing the Pumping speed or by reducing the length of stroke, or both. Reduction in load will also be obtained if the Pump-plunger diameter is reduced. However, reduction of speed, stroke or plunger diameter also has the effect reducing the production of the well. Recently a series of dynamometer tests has been made on pumping wells having the sucker rods supported on rubber cushions, so that the rods were in reality floating on rubber. The rubber cushions were originally intended merely to cushion shock loads and to dampen vibrations, but further study revealed that they had an important effect on the motion imparted to the sucker rods by the walking beam, and that rod loads were reduced without loss of production. With present walking-beam pumping units used to actuate sucker rods, the polished-rod motion is forced to coincide with the motion of the end of the walking beam. This motion is approximately simple-harmonic; but, due to pitman angularity and to the fact that the crank seldom, if ever, rotates at constant angular velocity the polished rod does not have true simple harmonic motion. However, since the following discussion concerns only the effect of small momentary variations of the polished-rod from the general reciprocating motion of the beam, it is not important that the walking-beam motion be exactly defined, and for the purposes of the present discussion it will be referred to as approximate simple-harmonic motion.

219,320780,,Importance of Compression Yield Strength in Establishing Setting Depths for Casing,T. McLean Jasper(A.O . Smith Corp.),,,,,,API-36-250,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"Higher compression yield strength in the transverse direction means increased collapse resistance and setting depth of casing. Higher tension yield strength in the longitudinal direction, coupled with this higher compression yield strength, means increased pull-out strength of threaded and coupled casing. This paper outlines the importance of these higher yield strengths, and describes methods for obtaining them. This paper also shows the need for revision of A.P.I. setting depths for casing as published in Supplement NO. 1 (January 1934) to A.P.I. Code No. 5. ? Correct setting-depth values are indicated in Fig. 4 of the paper. This key chart is based on mathematical analysis, and corroborated by some 500 collapse and correlated tests.The production of suitable casing for deep-well operation is a problem which has become increasingly important to the oil-producing industry, because greater depths of drilling have brought to light large increases in the available oil supply both in the United States and in other countries. The pressure on the outside of casing in oil wells is considered to be directly proportional to the depth of the well, and anything which will economically increase the collapse strength of the casing without increasing the thickness will add to the economical depth to which such casing can be set into the ground. The most important physical property of casing in resisting collapsing pressure is the compression yield point of the steel in the direction transverse to the axis of the casing. The most important dimensional properties in resisting the collapsing pressure are the diameter and thickness of the casing. These properties may be combined in the ratio D/t, or the outside diameter divided by the thickness. As the setting depth is increased by raising the collapse value of the casing, it becomes imperative that the pull-oat strength also be increased. The generally-accepted setting-depth values, based on collapse, which are accepted by the American Petroleum Institute are in the opinion of the author in need of revision. These values do not conform to the test results obtained for the higher D/t ratios, and do not accommodate all the various compression-yield-point steels for the lower D/t ratios. This paper contains a general discussion of the theory of collapse, some indications of the methods whereby the collapse resistance of casing can be increased, arid outlines the method for arriving at appropriate setting depths for casing. High compression yield strength in casing can be obtained by any one of the following methods: 1, using a steel with a high natural compression yield strength; 2, using an alloy steel susceptible to having the yield strength increased by heat treatment; or, 3, by using steels as now applied to the industry and raising the yield strength by mechanical means. This increased compression yield strength, obtained by any of the above methods, is accompanied by a correspondingly increased tensile yield strength in the longitudinal direction. The higher compression yield strength in the transverse direction is equivalent to a greater collapse setting depth.",,American Petroleum Institute

The development of deeper drilling .establishes a trend toward the use of casing of smaller diameter, the safe depth of which is limited by the joint rather than the collapse strength. This condition will permit the use of a thinner wall to resist collapse, but in turn it will require a joint of higher efficiency in tension than that of the regular A.P.I. design. The need of better joints for casing is further substantiated by experience in several areas where oil strings, set to a depth of approximately 9,000 ft. and under internal pressures higher than 3,000 Ib. per sq. in., consistently obtain considerable leakage through the threaded couplings. To meet these conditions the several manufacturers offer improved joints, mostly designed to obtain advantages offered by an upset, shouldered joint with a heavy power thread. To use an often repeated expression, the ideal joint to meet these conditions would be one of a flush design with 100 per cent joint strength. Such a requirement suggests the welded joint; and while neither operating technique nor welding material has advanced near to the point of perfection, from the experience in the field and in consideration of its economic advantage, it is believed that the welded joint has excellent prospects, and its development should be encouraged.FOREWORDThe development of new methods and materials following shortly after the demand for them has been the course in the development of tubular goods for service in oil wells. Conditions demanding the use of casing have varied from setting depths of somewhat less than 100 ft. in earlier times to depths of somewhat over 10,000 ft. at the present time. Similarly, the development of casing has progressed from the earlier times when it was fabricated from thin sheets of low-tensile material, rolled and riveted by hand in the local tinner's shop, to recent times when it is fabricated from high-tensile material under the precisely-controlled processes of the great mills. Although the development of casing has kept abreast of the demands, it is generally admitted that the present production trends have presented a problem in casing couplings that has not been adequately solved. There are on the market a number of designs for couplings which possess definite improvements over the A.P.I. couplings, and on which further development should be encouraged. However, in a search for a joint of flush design with 100 per cent efficiency, it is plausible to turn to welding with the hope that the success of welding pipe joints in associated industries will be repeated in the oil-production department. The purpose of this discussion is to point out the need for and the possibilities of the development of welded joints for casing, and also some of the problems to be encountered in that development.DATADesigns of Threaded CouplingsThe A.P.I. threaded coupling ? theretofore has adequately met the demands from the service conditions imposed upon it and, in addition, it has the economic advantage of simplicity in design which readily allows it to be reconditioned in local service shops.",,American Petroleum Institute

It has been beneficial to the equipment manufacturer as well as to the oil producer.It is probable that the standardization of working stresses, by the American Petroleum Institute, for design purposes has done more to insure correctly designed derricks than any other factor. This adoption of judicious formulas not only safeguards the ultimate user of steel derricks, but protects reputable manufacturers against unscrupulous or incompetent engineering design.Discussion of Column FormulasIn reviewing the method of arriving at the safe load capacity of a derrick, we quote from A.P.I. specifications for standard rigs and derrick, ?- as follows: . . . . The A.P.I. safe load capacity of an A.P.I. derrick . . . . shall be determined by computing the sum of the strengths of the four leg membersat their weakest section. These leg members must be designed in accordance with the A.P.I. column formulas.? The maximum unsupported length L of the leg (column) is designated as 7 ft.?The A.P.I. column formula, for regular structural steel, is the same as the American Institute of Steel Construction column formula (prior to the 1936 revision). This is a Rankine-Gordon type of formula, and during the past few years it has been generally accepted for structural-steel design-with the exception of the 1935 specifications of the American Railway Engineering Association and the practice of a prominent fabricating company, who favor a parabolic type of formulasuch as the following:(mathematical equation available in full paper)The progress in manufacturing processes during the last decade has brought about the production of steels of much higher quality than that produced in former years. As a result, the American Institute of Steel Construction has recently published, in pamphlet form,&sect; a 1936 revision to their specifications. This revision is a supplement to the latest issue of the A.I.S.C.Handbook: Steel Construction. The new specifications call for a basic unit tensile stress (on net section) of 20,000 lb. per sq. in.

The author would discourage the tendency of steel salesmen to emphasize the superior mechanical properties of their brands of machinery steel. The various mechanical properties of a large number of these alloy steels are compared; and it is shown that the differences in average values of any one property, such as yield point, is much less than the variation from average which may occur in any one type of steel. The uncertainty regarding the. physical factors which determine yielding is discussed. Various types of failure are then listed, and it is shown that the mechanical properties of the steel give us an incomplete picture regarding each type' of failure. Finally, the author makes a plea for a rating of the various steels on a basis ofdependabilityin which a high coefficient of dependability would correspond to a narrow range of variation in some particular property after the steel has been heat-treated to give a desired value of that property. The most certain evidence of the behavior of metals under a given set of working conditions consists in the accumulated results of many trials under those conditions. Jeffries and Archer,Science of Metals.Is there a best steel to use for a given service? Is there a best steel for elevator links or drill pipe or sucker rods? If so, are there any ways of determining this steel other than the expensive and time-consuming one of trial and error? To what extent are the results of mechanical testing an index of performance? These questions have an importance today which was little realized a few years ago. Oil wells are spudded in today to tap sands some two miles below the surface. Soon it may be necessary to pump from these depths. In spite of the improvement in engineering steels, equipment is being forced closer and closer to the limits of performance.For uses where the service is especially severe there is a wide diversity of opinion as to the best type of steel to be used. Steel users are confused by the rival claims of enthusiastic steel salesmen and by the contradictory conclusions arrived at by different operators. If a steel is being worked close to the limits of its performance, a dozen steel salesmen are at hand to assure you that they have a steel made especially to meet this particular situation and to talk learnedly of improved physicals and the proper proportioning of alloying elements. Sometimes a change to a different type of steel results in improved performance; frequently a change to a more expensive steel results in even poorer performance. Why this is so, nobody seems to know; but the new steel gets a black eye, and the general confusion deepens. We need a clearer picture of the relative importance of those factors upon which the selection of a steel is usually based. If our present knowledge of the mechanical properties of a steel gives us an incomplete picture of its performance, it will be worth something to know that.",,American Petroleum Institute

Demmler(Vanadium Corp. of America),,,,,,API-36-322,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"The authors present briefly the characteristics of vanadium steels and irons used in, or available for use in the oil industry, giving data on chemical and physical properties. They indicate that the uniformity of these steels and their contribution to useful strength and ability to withstand abuse warrant their greater utilization. Applications of various vanadium alloy steels to the various types of oil-field equipment are given.INTRODUCTIONThe consumption of ferrous metals in the oil and gas industry has been increasing practically without interruption for many years, and today represents an appreciable percentage of the total iron and steel consumed by all industries. Of this tonnage only a small proportion is alloy steel, and yet it appears that this small volume is growing at an even more rapid rate than the total of carbon and alloy iron and steel combined. In this alloy-steel tonnage, vanadium steels have always been included; and it is, therefore, of interest to point out those applications for which these steels with a vanadium content are especially suited. In spite of the rapid growth of rotary drilling during recent years, the older cable-tool drilling rigs are still in quite wide use. Each year a considerable quantity of steel is consumed for drill bits, stems, jars, crown blocks, etc., in this earlier or percussion-drilling method. In the rotary practice, there are also drill bits, collars, tool joints, kellys, crown and traveling blocks, etc. To keep these items working requires drilling engines, drawworks, rotary tables, mud pumps, etc. Add drill pipe and casings for these wells, and the complete story is still not told. Statistics indicate that there are more than 275,000 pumping wells in the United States alone; all these require sucker rods as well a s pull rods in many instances where the wells are pumped in groups from one engine. In flowing wells these parts are not needed; but, in a sense, valves replace-them. Once the oil is above ground, the refinery and its metal requirements must be considered. Here pumps, valves, pressure vessels, cracking stills, heat exchangers, etc., command major attention. Operating temperatures range from perhaps -75 deg. F. to more than 1,400 deg. F., while pressures may be from partial vacuum to 2,000 Ib. per sq. in., or higher. Aside, from these limitations, corrosion is often a serious detail, and in the refinery this is much more serious than in the field. This initial brief review serves as a reminder of, the multiplicity of conditions under which' metals must serve the oil and gas industry, and as a warning that the solution of a problem is often not simple; and that, further, no small number of metals can satisfactorily meet all the varied needs.Drill Jars and BitsIn percussion drilling, saving of weight is of no great importance .except in the engine and the crown block. Consequently, higher-strength materials in the tool parts, with their somewhat higher price per pound, cannot reinforce their position by a corresponding weight reduction.",,American Petroleum Institute

Combinations of highstatic and, dynamic stresses involving fatigue, impact, shear or bending are often encountered simultaneously even under normal conditions; and when emergencies arise, their severity may be increased several-fold.The nickel-alloy steels, through their ability to meet these unusual requirements, have gained an excellent reputation in this field. Their toughness at extreme hardness, and their ability to resist high-fatigue and impact stresses, under conditions which often involve severe over-stressing, have characterized them, as being well fitted for the grueling service encountered in the oil fields. Some of these steels and their typical applications are described in the following paragraphs.Drilling ToolsSince compactness is an essential feature in the design of drilling tools, the unit stresses imposed on these parts in service are usually great and frequently accompanied by over-stressing. Rock bits are subjected to severe abrasion accompanied by high-shear, torsional, and impact stresses. In order to satisfy these requirements modern rotary rock bits, coring heads, and reamers are designed as composite units, made up of three or more types of steel each selected for its adaptability to meet some particular phase of this service.On these tools the bodies function as supporting heads for the cutters, and are often made of nickel-alloy steel castings containing 0.35-0.40 .per cent carbon, 1.00-1.25 per cent nickel, 0.40-0.60 per cent chromium. Typical mechanical properties after oil quenching and tempering are as follows:(available in full paper)A water-hardened cast-nickel-molybdenuin steel, containing approximately 0.25-0.30 per cent carbon, 0.60-0.80 per cent manganese, 1.00-1.50 per cent nickel, and 0.25-0.30 per cent molybdenum, is also used by some manufacturers who claim that this steel offers advantages from the standpoint of welding. This is important where it is the practice to re-dress or re-build tools by welding. After water quenching and tempering, mechanical properties similar to those quoted for the oil-quenched nickel-chromium steel just described are obtained.Reamer bodies are usually forged from an alloy steel such as SAE 3140. To insure sufficient hardenability in the heavier sections, however, a modified composition known as SAE X-3140 is coming into extensive use. This steel is similar .in composition to SAE 3140, except that the chromium limits have been raised to 0.60-0.90 per cent. Data showing mechanical properties of these steels will be found in Table 2.Rock-bit cutters are generally of the movable type, i.e., toothed cones or serrated cylinders or discs mounted on the head or body by means of suitable pins or bushings. These cutters are usually machined from low carbon nickel-alloy steel forgings (SAE 3115, 4615, 2315) and subsequently case-hardened to impart the necessary wear resistance.",,American Petroleum Institute
225,320786,,Molybdenum in Modern Oil-Drilling and -Production Equipment,John E. Wilson(Climax Blolybdenum Co.),,,,,,API-36-340,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"The trend to deeper oil wells has necessitated an improvement in the physical properties of oil-drilling and -production equipment. In many instances an improvement has been obtained through the use of molybdenum. This paper discusses the effect of mo1ybdenum in cast iron and steel, together with its application in oil-well equipment.INTRODUCTIONThe modern trend to deep-well drilling has placed increasing demands on both the drilling and production equipment. Greater loads and speeds encountered in both the surface and the sub-surface equipment, resulting from the longer strings and demand for reduction in drilling time, have made necessary increases in the yield strength, fatigue strength, shock resistance, and wear resistance of the equipment. When corrosion has become a problem in the deep wells (either from brine or sulfur compounds) there has been a demand for increased resistance to corrosion fatigue; likewise increased pressures, which are encountered both in drilling and flowing wells, have required pressure valves and fittings of increased strength and resistance to impact. In many instances a ' modification of design has overcome the ensuing problems. Due to the nature of the operations, however, the designer has had very definite limitations; and, accordingly, a great deal of attention has been given to the nature of the material employed. Attempts were first made to meet those conditions demanding increased strength by varying the carbon content and by changing the heat treatment. In many cases the resultant increase in strength was insufficient to cope with the situation. In others, it was soon noticed that the increases in strength were gained at the expense of toughness and ductility as measured by impact properties, elongation, and reduction of area. It has been the place of alloys to obtain these combinations of properties in steel, as well as to improve in some cases a single property not obtainable by plain carbon steel. Among those alloys that received rapid recognition because of their noticeable improvement over unalloyed steel and cast iron have been the alloys of molybdenum. To understand better the part molybdenum has assumed, it is necessary to have a general knowledge of its effect in steel and cast iron.STEELMolybdenum as an alloying element in the iron-carbon system is soluble in both a and &iquest; iron, and forms the carbide Mo2C. The critical points are raised slightly on heating, and are lowered markedly on cooling. This sluggishness which molybdenum imparts to steel, permitting the use of higher temperatures during heat treating and the use of less drastic quenching operations, is likewise responsible for the grain refinement and depth hardness that is obtained through its application. The effect of molybdenum additions to steel is reflected in a marked increase in the ultimate and yield strengths, without a corresponding loss in elongation and reduction of area. A comparison of the physical properties of a water-quenched SAE 1040 steel with a water-quenched carbon-molybdenum steel is shown by the curves A and B in Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4. It can be noticed in the plain carbon steel (curve B) that there is a marked loss in the ductility with a corresponding increase in the ultimate and yield strengths; while the addition of molybdenum, illustrated by curve A, increases the tensile strength approximately 30 per cent for the same elongation, and approximately 42 per cent for the same reduction of area.",,American Petroleum Institute

Ross Keyte(Marathon Oil Co.),,,,,,API-36-360,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"The research project on source beds, sponsored jointly by the U. S. Geological Survey and the American Petroleum Institute, for the past 18 months has undertaken a study of the degree of reduction as an index of source beds. As indicated in a previous paper on this same subject presented before the Institute at the Los Angeles meeting, this index has to be tested in several petroliferous provinces before its value can be definitely ascertained. Thus far it has been found to prevail in two petroliferous regions, viz., the Rocky Mountains and the Mid Continent; as sediments regarded as source beds in these areas have been observed commonly to have a relatively high degree of reduction. In this paper this relationship is extended to the East Texas basin, as most of the sediments associated with oil zones there in general have been found to have a comparatively high-degree of reduction. The relationship, as in other areas, however, has not been observed to hold invariably. Each succeeding area in which the relationship is found to prevail strengthens the probability that it is real and not anomalous. If it is found to hold in the three remaining petroliferous provinces that are now being studied, viz., California, Gulf Coast, and Appalachian, the probability will be strong that it is a true relationship, with the result that it can be recommended to geologists for consideration in prospecting for oil.INTRODUCTIONThe American Petroleum Institute and the U. S. Geological Survey for the past several years have been undertaking an investigation of source beds. Source beds are the rocks in the ground that contain substances from which petroleum has been or can be generated. In prospecting for oil it is of distinct financial advantage to the oil operator to know the extent to which oil-forming rocks are present in the areas in which he is interested. The main object of this investigation on source beds is to develop criteria which will enable a geologist to recognize oil-forming rocks and thus help in lessening the cost of finding oil. In this work several possible means of recognizing source beds have been considered,1abut for the past 18 months attention has been concentrated on the degree of reduction of the sediments. The degree of reduction is a rough index of the oxygen content of the organic matter in the sediments. Petroleum consists of compounds low in oxygen and high in hydrogen. The materials from which it is generated, accordingly, may be expected to be relatively rich in reduced substances, i.e., in substances of relatively low oxygen content. An attempt is being made at present to ascertain if the state of reduction of sediments may be used as an index of source beds. In such work it would be highly desirable to analyze sediments definitely known to be source beds to see if they actually are reduced in comparison with ordinary sediments, but unfortunately no beds are known with absolute certainty to be source beds.",,American Petroleum Institute

This in turn perturbs the density and P- and S-wave velocities in the near-wellbore region. This study focuses on two wells in a gas reservoir. The radial saturation distribution of mud filtrate and connate formation fluids is first obtained by simulating the mud-filtrate invasion process in the near-wellbore region. Subsequently, radial profiles of the elastic properties are calculated by applying a Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution model. By making use of the radial profiles of density and P- and S-wave velocities, monopole and dipole acoustic array waveforms are simulated. An industry standard Slowness-Time-Coherence (STC) method is then used to extract P- and S-wave velocities from the simulated waveforms. Velocities from STC processing show that a sharp interface model does not reflect the true radial profiles of the near-wellbore elastic properties and a radially multi-layered model represents the invaded zone correctly. We also show that log correction with the Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution model for the deeply invaded well is valid.",,Society of Exploration Geophysicists

Whitman Patnode(U.S. Geological Surrey),,,,,,API-36-368,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"Eight characteristics of sediments are considered as possible means of recognizing source beds: 1, quantity of organic matter in the sediments; 2, reducing power, which is a measure of ability of the sediments to reduce chromic acid; 3, color of sediments4; , volatility of sediments; 5, degree of volatility, which is a measure of the volatility with respect to the organic content; 6, ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the sediments; 7, oxidation factor, which is an index of the state of oxidation of the sediments, and is the ratio of the carbon content to the reducing power; and, 8, the nitrogen-reduction ratio, which is the ratio of the nitrogen content to the reducing power. Several thousand determinations of these characteristics have been made and averaged from more than 800 lithologic units from many areas in the California, Rocky Mountain, Mid-continent, East Texas, and Gulf Coast oil regions. The thickness of these units ranges from 50 ft. to 500 ft. Each of them has been classified according to its probable richness in source material of petroleum. Nearness to producing zones has been the basis of classification, as it seems more reasonable to assume that oil in general accumulates near where it is generated than to assume that it ordinarily accumulates far from where it is made. Three classes were made: 1, lithologic units within 250 ft. stratigraphically above or below an oil zone and less than 2 miles from an oil field; 2, (a) units within 500 ft. above or below an oil zone and within 15 miles of an oil field (excluding, of course, those that belong to the first class) and (b) units within 250 ft. stratigraphically of a horizon and more than 15 miles distant from an oil field, provided the unit is located within a region in which the horizon is generally productive of oil or yields significant quantity of oily substances when extracted with ether; and, 3, all other beds, viz., those more than 500 ft. above or below an oil horizon or more than 15 miles distant from an oil field and beds at greater distance if they are within 250 ft. of horizons that generally contain oil in the area. These three classes are designated in this report as productive, questionably productive, and barren. Productive units naturally may contain some beds that are poor in source material, and barren units may contain beds that are rich in source material ; but, on the whole, the productive units-because of their nearness to oil zones are more likely to be richer in mother substances of petroleum than are the barren units. Each of the eight characteristics was averaged for each of the three classes of productivity, for each of the five oil areas: California, Rocky Mountains, Mid Continent, East Texas, and Gulf Coast. The average organic content, of the productive and barren units was found to be approximately the same in each region studied, from which it is inferred that the quantity of organic matter in a sediment probably is not a reliable guide of the ability of the sediments to generate oil.",,American Petroleum Institute
229,320789,,Present Status of the Hypothesis of Biogenesis of Petroleum,Lewis A. Thayer(American Petroleum Institute),,,,,,API-36-385,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"The Engler-Hofer theory postulates that organic material is transformed into petroleum by, purely physical-chemical processes such as destructive distillation rather than by bacterial action. To this the author objects: because this theory assumes that fatty materials are but little subject to bacterial destruction; whereas fats, being rich in energy, theoretically should have many microbiological attackers. The author then presents new experimental evidence to show the correctness of his contention. He states that the results of these experiments, while giving little direct evidence that hydrocarbons are formed by bacterial action, do not vitiate the reasons for believing that petroleum has been formed biogenetically, since many possibilities remain untested-adding that critical examination of data available leads to the conclusion that future experiments should include substrates other than fats, and should be conducted with high substrate concentrations, both aerobically and anaerobically.BIOGENESIS VS. DESTRUCTIVE DISTILLATIONThe theory of biogenesis as applied to petroleum is that the transformation of organic material to petroleum has been brought about by bacterial action rather than by purely physical-chemical processes such as destructive distillation, as is postulated by the Engler-Hofer theory.1aThe latter theory is grounded chiefly in the laboratory experiments on pyolysis which establish well enough the fact that, under conditions of high temperatures and pressures, fatty or waxy materials from any source can be transformed into a liquid resembling petroleum in appearance and containing many constituents found in petroleum.2The laboratory experiments, however, fail to duplicate nature in at least two respects, i.e., time and temperature; and it has never been conclusively shown that the short-time high-temperature conditions of the laboratory are exactly equivalent to the long-time low-temperature conditions of nature.3Taking a number of factors into consideration,4the writer has come to the conclusion that such a slow process of destructive distillation isprobablytheoretically possible; there is, however, a much more serious objection to the theory. Considerable pressure is admittedly necessary for the conduct of a destructive-distillation process, which pressure is provided in nature by the burial of source materials beneath considerable depths of superimposed sediments. The accumulation of these overlying sediments requires ages; what is happening to their organic contents in the meantime? Organic matter ordinarily decays within a few months, at most; why should organic matter destined to become petroleum be granted a special dispensation of Providence to protect it from destruction by bacteria? It is true that the Engler- Hofer theory does indeed take cognizance of bacterial action by supposing it to lower the oxygen, nitrogen, and perhaps sulfur contents of the organic material;5it has been explained that the carbohydrate constituents were mostly decomposed completely, -the proteins transformed into optically-active fatty acids-and the latter, together with the fatty constituents of the original protoplasm, simply were not subject to much bacterial action. At the time this scheme was first proposed, comparatively little was known of the action of microorganisms upon fats. From the theoretical standpoint, however, fats and hydrocarbons contain a wealth of energy and, in general, micro-organisms are good safecrackers ; subsequently, it should be expected that some of them would be able to decompose fats where-ever found.",,American Petroleum Institute
230,320790,,Louisiana Petroleum Stratigraphy,Henry V. Howe(Louisiana State University),,,,,,API-36-405,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"INTRODUCTIONSuccess in finding petroleum is dependent upon accurate stratigraphic information. The, recent discovery of the Rodessa field in north Louisiana and of the Bosco, Roanoke, Lafitte, Tepetate, St. Martinsville, Jeanerelle, and Willow Lake (Big Lake) fields in South Louisiana has focused attention upon the state as a great potential source of new petroleum. The production at Rodessa comes from around 6,000 ft., in the other fields it has been obtained at depths ranging from 5,000 to nearly 10,000 ft. These fields have opened up production from many new horizons. The stratigraphic information which they afford will lead to the finding of additional fields-which, in, turn, should supply data helpful in locating yet more sources of production. The concept that the northern border of the Gulf of Mexico is the landward side of the greatest and most actively growing geosyncline on the North American Continent is a development largely of the past 10 years.1aIt has resulted in part from geophysical data, in part from the comparatively new study of micropaleontology. All of the 30,000 ft. to 40,000 ft. of sediments which compose this great geosyncline have been laid down as near shore deposits, and their combined weight has depressed the northern border of the Gulf of Mexico to perhaps three times its maximum depth of 12,000 ft. It is not unreasonable to assume that the next few years will see production obtained from late Tertiary beds in south Louisiana at depths in excess of that figure. Ideas govern actions, and in the petroleum industry most wells are drilled with the idea of reaching known producing horizons. In Louisiana the petroleum industry has developed around two main centers of activity,: the salt dome region of southern Louisiana, and the Cretaceous fields in the northern part of the state. Most of the companies operating in the former area have had their headquarters at Houston; those operating in the latter have had Shreveport as their base. The ideas developed in these two petroleum centers have largely governed the exploration and development of their respective areas. Significant events which have affected the petroleum history of Louisiana may be summarized as follows: The earliest activity, in south Louisiana was started at Jennings (1901) where prolific production was found at relatively shallow depth in sands overlying the salt core. This development followed shortly after the epochal Lucas gusher at Spindletop, Tex., where production was obtained from shallow cap rock. In the ensuing 15 years practically all wells drilled in south Louisiana had cap rock or shallow super-dome sands as their objective. A second epoch in the petroleum development of south Louisiana followed the finding in 1914, of flank production in the sands about the sides of the Sour Lake and Humble domes of coastal Texas. The search for flank production has continued steadily since that date, but acquired added momentum in 1926 by the finding of production below 5,000 ft. on the sides of, the old Spindletop dome, and by the recognition of sah-overhang at Barbers Hill, Tex., in 1929, which was followed shortly after by a similar development on the southeast flank of the Jennings dome, where, production was found below 7,000 ft.",,American Petroleum Institute

As of April 1, 1936, there were 120 oil wells and 20 gas wells in the field. As of the same date, 4,689,000 bbl. of oil had been produced. This was paraffin-base oil, with a gravity of 43 deg. API. At the present time about 6,500 acres may be considered as proven oil and gas acreage. The accumulation of oil and gas occurs on the upthrown side of the main Rodessa fault, in horizons underlying the Massive Anhydrite member of the Glen Rose formation at a depth of about 6,000 ft. The structure. is typically fault-line. Heavy-duty rotary rigs are used for drilling the wells, which are completed in approximately 45 days. Sticking and twisting-off of drill pipe, washouts, and sticking of casing and liner have been the principal drilling difficulties encountered. The major production problem has been in connection with the excessive gas-oil ratios resulting from the inability to land and cement the production string below the gas-oil contact, which occurs at a depth of approximately 5,725 ft. below sea level.IntroductionThe Rodessa Field, illustrated in Fig. 1, was discovered August 3, 1930, upon the completion of the R. W. Norton Hill No. 1 as a gas well at a total depth of 5,505 ft. Previously numerous wells had been drilled on the structure by other operators, but none had reached a sufficient depth to penetrate the Basal Anhydrite reservoirs which had been productive of oil and gas at Pine Island and cotton Valley, and which had produced gas at Sligo, Sugar Creek, and Bethany. After the completion of the discovery gas well, the field was developed for gas until July 7, 1935, on which date the discovery oil well was completed by the United Gas Public Service Company on the I. L. Young lease at a total depth of 6,048 ft. At that time a total of 20 gas wells had been drilled and completed in the field, proving its linear extent for about six miles. As of April 1, 1936, 120 oil wells had been completed in the field and approximately 4,689,000 bbl. of oil produced. As of the same date, there were about 62 active locations. At the present time about 6,500 acres may be regarded as having been proved for oil and gas production, and an additional 3,500 acres for the production of gas. Prior to the discovery of gas in the horizon immediately underlying the anhydrite, the Rodessa Field was generally not believed to be potential for production due to the absence of accumulation of either oil or gas in the reservoirs of the Upper Cketaceous formations such as the Nacatoch, Chalk, and the Buckrange, which formations had been productive in the closely adjacent Caddo Field and Pine Island Field, as well as in other fields of northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas.",,American Petroleum Institute

Meier(The Atlantic Refining Co.),,,,,,API-36-431,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1936,"After defining briefly the scope of vocational training, the author gives the advantages to oil-field workers, with a concise outline of the history of vocational training under the Smith-Hughes act, together with the Institute's part in this work, with statistics on enrollment, etc.Scope of Vocational TrainingThis paper is not a dissertation on how to achieve success in 10 lessons, or even that many subjects. The author's endeavor is to present briefly why vocational education is worthwhile, how it may be obtained, and the benefits from it that may accrue to both employee and employer in our industry. Webster's, dictionary states that the main purpose of a vocational school is to provide training for an occupation or appropriate employment. Vocational courses are not intended to be a substitute for the curricula of grade or high schools, nor are they intended to be collegiate or liberal in scope. These few words explain the object of vocational education, and also its limitations. Almost every normal person has a desire to progress, to better his station in life, to achieve success in business, to be more than just another worker. Of course, it is impossible for all to become foremen, general superintendents, or vice presidents, but it is certainly worth trying. Nevertheless, systematic study will enable anyone to learn more about his particular occupation and those occupations allied or related to it. This broadening of one's vocational education not only better fits the individual to perform his job; but, if the opportunity to advance presents itself, he stands a better chance for promotion than the man who has not taken advantage of increasing his vocational knowledge. Oil-field workers today realize that injuries resulting from accidents are not only expensive to the employer, but are expensive to the worker. They also realize that accidents which may cause injuries to workmen or damage to equipment are the result of mistakes usually due to the lack of understanding of some phase of the job. The vocational-training courses are bringing about a better understanding and appreciation of the work to be done and, therefore, should be of material benefit in reducing the accident rate and in keeping the worker on the job.Smith-Hughes ActAny man who has been employed in the petroleum industry for the past 10 years can attest to the fact that vast changes have taken place in all branches. New methods have been adopted, and the technique of their application has greatly improved. Standards of workmanship have been raised, and the individual worker finds that study and earnest application of his talents are required not only to keep pace with progress, but to better himself. While there is a place in the oil industry for the strong back, brain is more important than brawn to meet modern conditions. No man can stand still very long in any occupation. The man who does not grow with his job will eventually be outdistanced by his fellow worker, and gradually forced to give way to the man who has acquired knowledge and improved his ability through study and training.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hayward(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-37-008,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author describes laboratory apparatus designed to simulate, on a small scale, conditions at the wells; and shows that tests with this apparatus can be used to elucidate problems met with in the field. Various causes of stuck drill pipe and casing are described, together with recommended practices for prevention and cure.One of the most serious accidents that can happen to a well is the sticking of casing, drill pipe, or tubing. Very little has been published regarding the cause and prevention of these accidents, and even less about overcoming them when they have occurred. The writer believes that much is to be learned both regarding prevention and cure, and in; this paper attempts a beginning of this task. During the last several months scraps of information and case histories have been collected as they came to hand. It is realized that the value of the material here presented varies widely, and it has been difficult to arrange in a coherent manner. When a string of drill pipe sticks, the usual thing is to start pulling and slacking off-although these operations are seldom successful. In territories such as Oklahoma City, oil spotting offers a good chance of success, but even on this there is no general agreement regarding the best method of procedure. Should the pipe be held in tension, or should it be alternately pulled and slacked off? What is the best oil to use? How much should be used? The problem may be attacked along two principal lines: 1, research with small-scale apparatus in laboratories; 2, the recording and studying of actual field case histories. Regarding the latter, the Institute's Topical Committee on Drilling Practice recently circulated a questionnaire regarding causes and cures of stuck pipe. A few replies have already been received, and contain a great deal of valuable information indicating great interest in the matter under discussion. Although this is far too extensive for inclusion here, a few quotations are given where they help the discussion. The selection of the quotations used was made by the writer of this paper, and covers but a very small fraction of the valuable information contained in the replies.? The opinions expressed in connection with them are also personal, and do not necessarily represent the majority opinion contained in the replies. A short while ago a liner and screen were being set in a Gulf Coast well. The back of the screen and the face of the sand were being washed by pumping water down the tubing and up behind the screen, which was suspended from the tubing preparatory to setting the packer. Just about the time that it was decided to set the packer, the liner was found to be stuck; and, as the screen was 10 ft. off bottom, it was too high up to make the completion. Alternate pulling and slacking off were resorted to without success. The pumps, which were already compounded, were speeded up, as circulation had not been altogether lost-and this also was unsuccessful. When there appeared to be no prospect of freeing the liner, it was decided to turn loose from it, mud the hole, and extract the tubing in order to go back in with the drill pipe to cut and fish out the liner.",,American Petroleum Institute
234,320794,,Field Control of Drilling Mud,P.H. Jones(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-37-024,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author discusses in detail the apparatus and procedure used in California in making field tests of drilling muds to determine weight, viscosity, sand content, yield point, and static performance (tendency to prevent loss of water into formation); the equipment is simple, rugged, and can be used successfully by the drilling crew with proper supervision. In addition, a short discussion is included on centralized control of drilling muds where several drilling wells are close together.The quality of drilling mud needed for any drilling project, and the testing procedures required for the maintenance of this quality are dependent upon the drilling conditions encountered. However, the organizations required for the field control of drilling mud fall naturally into two categories. The first involves the control of mud in individual wells located far from other drilling projects and established laboratory facilities, and the second has to do with control where a number of wells are being drilled in the same field or in fields sufficiently close together to permit the establishment of a single field laboratory for making mud tests.Mud Balance. FIG. 1(available in full paper)Routine Mud Control for Isolated WellsIn the control of mud used in isolated wells, it has been found advisable to provide, a t the wells, instruments for making routine tests covering the weight, apparent viscosity, and sand content of the mud. The responsibility for making these routine tests can be delegated satisfactorily to members of the drilling crew, but in so doing it must be recognized that the prime function and major interest of the crew are to make hole. It is necessary, therefore, that particular attention be given to training the crew both as to methods of testing and the importance of mud control. Furthermore, it is necessary that the mud-testing apparatus be durable, simple to operate, and reasonably accurate. -41~i0t has been found advisable to provide, at each well, a simple cabinet for housing the testing instruments.Weight of MudThe apparatus used for determining the density or weight of the drilling mud can be the well-known mud-weight hydrometer or the constant-volume bucket-and-spring balance. Both of these instruments have been used widely, and have rendered valuable service. However, it has been found that both are damaged easily or thrown out of adjustment, so that unreliable results are obtained occasionally. In order to overcome these difficulties, a simple mud-weight balance was developed, which is illustrated in Fig. 1. This instrument consists essentially of a constant-volume cup that is attached rigidly to a graduated arm, the arm and sup being free to rotate in a plane perpendicular to a horizontal supporting knife edge. The position of a slide on the arm can be adjusted to bring the cup and arm in balance, the arm being grooved to fit a V-shaped projection on the slide in such a manner that when the slide is once attached to the apparatus it cannot be lost. The instrument is so constructed and calibrated that, when the system is in balance with mud in the cup, the position of the slide shows the relative density or weight of the mud as compared with water.",,American Petroleum Institute
235,320795,,Bottom-Hole Well-Completion Methods in the Gulf Coast,I.W. Alcorn(The Pure Oil Co.)|J.U. Teague(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-37-030,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Three methods of bottom-hole well completion are in general use in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast:The oil string is set and cemented through the producing horizon, and then gun-perforated opposite the section from which it is desired to produce. Screen may or may not be set at the option of the operator.The oil string is set and cemented on top of the producing section, and screen or slotted pipe with blank liner and packer is set opposite the section to be produced. This method is the one commonly used.Screen is run on the oil string with a full-hole cementing device above the screen. This device allows casing to be cemented after the screen has been washed on the outside to some degree.Due to the wide variation of sand conditions encountered in this area, the method which best suits a particular condition must be determined by the operator. Results obtained in the field indicate that cementation of producing sand has a definite bearing on the size of screen openings to be used.HISTORYThe use of wire screen in the completion of wells in the Gulf Coast dates back to the early days of Spindletop, in the early 1900's. From the crude methods employed a t that time the science and development of bottom- hole well-completion methods have continually advanced, although even today exact data on underground well conditions are lacking in many particulars. There are numerous differences of opinion on the subject, and much yet remains to bring this particular phase of production on the Gulf Coast to the advanced stages of development achieved in many other phases of the business.CONVENTIONAL METHODS IN USE TODAYThe various ideas and methods being adopted in present-day practice may be listed as follows: 1. Full-gage hole is drilled to bottom with blank casing run to bottom, and then cemented and perforated. Optional procedure from this point may be to hang tubing free in hole without setting screen and packer (Fig. 1) or to complete with screen or slotted pipe and packer (Fig. 2). In the latter case the tubing, instead of hanging free, may be sealed on top of the liner or pack-off between tubing and liner. While the majority of completions follow method No. 2, method No. 1 is no doubt gaining much favor and is, of course, the more recent development. As a matter of interest, it will be noted that during the period August 15, 1934 to December 31, 1936 there were performed 3,223 perforation jobs, for 431 different customers. All of these, of course, were not initial completions, but include many work-over jobs. This distribution of the gun-perforating jobs done during December 1936 and January 1937 is shown in Table 1. It will be observed that the majority of these jobs were made in the Texas Gulf Coast, principally in the Corpus Christi area-which, incidentally, is an area quite difficult to handle from the standpoint of well completions, inasmuch as the sand sections are thin and the gas-oil",,American Petroleum Institute
236,320796,,Selection of Size of Oil Strings for Wells in California,Ernest K. Parks(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-37-041,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Costs of larger oil strings are easily estimated, but economic justification involves detailed appraisal of functions which vary with size. Well preservation is fundamental. Pipe must resist bending, and larger and heavier casing gives greater bending strength per pound of steel. Perforations are discussed, and it is shown that the vertical slot reduces the section modulus, and hence the bending strength, the least. Detailed practice is not reviewed, but a summary of casing used in California in 1936 shows that the 8 5/8-in. water string and the 6 5/8-in. liner was the most common program. Tables show the limiting effect of small casings upon suitable pump diameters, and factors which facilitate well cleaning in larger-sized casings. Simple formulas are developed to illustrate that a very slight bend requires a large clearance for free passage of bailers or other internal pipe sections. The size of hole as related to production rate is discussed with reference to the familiar kinetic pressure gradient, and other considerations which indicate a great restriction of flow near the well bore. It is concluded that:Economics of well design involve consideration of production practice.Investigation of effect of hole size is warranted.Perforations deserve continued study.Advantages of additional oil-string size may possibly be evaluated early in the development state.INTRODUCTIONIn the systematic development of proved oil lands there often is enough latitude in the possible casing program to allow the operator a reasonable choice of oil-string size.? There must be some basis for a decision. Obviously, one cannot prescribe that this should be a minimum. On the other hand, a maximum might be equally absurd. How then can a size be chosen which shall be an economic selection? The first consideration of proposed casing programs is the cost, which will not be discussed because it is best determined in each case by those who are responsible for drilling. The larger the oil string, the more the cost. It then follows that to determine and appraise the advantages of larger sizes is the most pressing problem. The solution involves a definition of the functions of the oil string, a review of their operating features during the productive life of the well, and a special study of those functions which vary with size. It is realized that the peculiarities are innumerable, and that important factors are difficult to evaluate. Nevertheless, an attempt is made to present the problem within limits of experience.FUNCTIONS OF THE OIL STRINGAlthough hundreds of wells in other oil-producing regions are completed with open hole throughout the productive horizon, California operators use oil strings because they cannot get along without them. To preserve the well is the primary object. The oil string must be strong enough to withstand the variously-applied forces of caving formations; it should act as a screen to restrain solids from entering the well; it should be of material which resists the corrosion of oil-field waters, and the erosion caused by the flow of fluids; and it must also endure internal hazards such as tubingwear, fishing, and operations necessary in alterations or repairs.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-37-049,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author first outlines the early development of control equipment; then gives fundamental principles of efficient blowout control devices, and a classification of types followed by the chronological development and improvement of mechanical control-citing cases in which specific blowouts led to particular improvements. The author emphasizes systematic training of personnel to combat blowouts. He states that marked development in flow-line control equipment has come about only quite recently; then gives an outline of methods used to control the opening through the drilling string. The author concludes that modern control equipment when intelligently maintained and operated, together with proper utilization of the drilling fluid, will prevent blowouts.INTRODUCTIONAlthough the author has not been able to locate published records showing the origin or subsequent development of mechanical well, control equipment, any research on the subject will reveal that since 1882 necessity to blowouts on drilling oil wells has been , the mother of very prolific invention. Innumerable patents, bear witness to the unending search for new or improved methods of controlling well pressures at the surface. Inasmuch a limited time has been allotted for discussion of the subject in hand, this paper makes no attempt to deal with the development and use of synthetic weight materials as a factor in the control of drilling oil 'wells, which has been discussed in previous Institute papers;1,2,3anor is the matter of flanged vs. threaded connections discussed herein. Further, although many interesting and effective methods involving ingenious apparatus have been devised for the purpose of capping or oil wells once they got out of control, it has been judged that this type of equipment falls outside the scope of a paper dealing with control Obviously, the task of wild wells involves a technique and special equipment, required only when drilling control equipment has failed.Early Blowout Control DevicesInsofar as can be determined, the earliest device that may be classified under the general heading of blowout preventers is one patented by M.A. Lanagan, bearing the patent serial number 267,903, and dated November 21, 1882 (see Fig. 1). This device was designed to serve as a means of shearing the drilling cable in a cable-tool well and to the seal the well bore. As indicated in Fig. 1, when the movable shear block was pulled to the closed position, two horizontal ports came to rest opposite two flow lines leading from the housing of the device. In the intervening 55 years there have been granted approximately 10,000 patents covering various forms of well control apparatus. Almost all of these inventions and improvements have striven to embody the fundamental principles of blowout control as recited in the letters patent of the Lanagan invention to wit: If the flow of oil or gas from the well can be quickly stopped or diverted... it is a comparatively easy matter to arrest their progress... An apparatus which, when not in use, will not interfere with the boring of the well... but which, when the occasion requires, can be instantly operated from a safe distance...

238,320798,,Vibration Problems in Oil Wells,J.C. Slonneger(The Continental Supply Co.),,,,,,API-37-179,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author discusses a simplified method of calculating vibration frequencies as applied to sucker rods and cable tools, and shows ready reference charts for these frequencies. In the discussion of the effects of vibration on oil well pumping, it is disclosed that the vibration of the rods has a profound effect upon the contour of the dynanionieter card. This is shown by the development of n series of theoretical cards from the standpoint of vibration and well loads which have characteristic contours, easily recognized in the actual dynaniometer card. Numerous dynaniometer cards, taken from operating wells and covering a variety of well conditions, are shown which confirm the theoretical consideration. Cable tooling is also briefly discussed. There are, however, no hard and fast conclusions. The author leaves the subject open to further study and discussion.Every dynamic system has a definite fundamental natural frequency of vibration. This is true because all materials possess mass and elasticity and, therefore, are subject to vibration. Sometimes these vibrations are essential and desirable, sometimes of no consequence, and sometimes they are troublesome and not wanted. Usually it is desirable to know what the natural frequency of a system is, so that the design or operation, or both, may be governed to make use of or to avoid these vibrations as best suits the purpose. It is apparent that in every-day engineering practice vibration problems are not given the consideration which is their just due. This is largely due to the fact that vibration problems have not been very well understood in the past. This need no longer be true; for the great work of Timoshenko,Vibration Problems in Engineering, is quite simple and clear. His exposition of the theoretical mathematics involved is unusually complete, and leaves little to be desired. Most vibration problems need only a wise application of the theory for their solution. It is the purpose of this paper to encourage a wider application of this engineering aspect to problems in the petroleum industry, and to present certain definite information for ready reference to that end.Pendulum FormulaFor the purpose of clarity in following the discussion, some of the fundamental principles of vibration will first be reviewed. In order to get at the simplicity of the problem, we must go to simple illustrations and analogies. First, the fact must be kept in mind that all vibrations, regardless of their nature, have their root in the fundamental principle that pure vibrations are simple harmonic motion. Hence, any simple harmonic motion may be used for a study of the fundamental principles. The simple pendulum serves this purpose admirably. The formula for the time of one complete vibration of a simple pendulum is given by:(mathematical equation available in full paper)Thus we see, for a fixed value of g, the time and the frequency are a function of the square root of the length l. In the general equation for vibrations, we have:(mathematical equation available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Coberly(Kobe Inc.),,,,,,API-37-189,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Free entrance of oil with exclusion of sand is the function of screen pipe. To perform this function properly, the screen opening, regardless of type, must bear a definite relation to the grain size of the sand. Tests under simple, ideal conditions, using spherical grains of one diameter, show that a stable bridge is established when the width of a rectangular slot is two times the grain size or when the diameter of a circular opening is three times the grain size. With openings exceeding these values by approximately 25 per cent, no bridge will form. Angular grains will form a stable bridge under the same conditions as spherical grains. Due to the angularity of the grains, the point at which bridging ceases is extended to openings approximately 50 per cent in excess of these values for the samples investigated. Tests with mixtures containing two sizes show that the bridging influence of the larger grain is great in relation to the amount present. Unconsolidated oil sands with typical grain distribution will form stable bridges if the opening in the screen which retains 10 per cent of the sample is taken as the diameter of the bridging grain and the rules for uniform spherical grains applied. Methods and apparatus used for making these determinations are discussed.INTRODUCTIONThe proper functioning of screen casing is important to the production of oil, as it materially affects the pressure gradient in the immediate vicinity of the well, and it controls the production of sand with the oil. There has been some research and considerable speculation about the shape, size, position, and arrangement of openings in screen and perforated casing; yet little published data on which-to base their selection have been available.PREVIOUS WORKAt the time the first experimental work reported in this paper was performed (1929-1930) work had been done by E. A. Carr1aon the study of core analyses as related to the mesh of wire-wrapped screen casing. Some research had also been conducted by F. G. Tickell at Stanford University, on the bridging action of sand grains of a single classification and of one-to-one mixtures of grains of two classifications. Work on the behavior of core sands in bridging slots had also been performed by F. A. Graser2under the direction of Lester C. Uren at the University of California. Most of this work has remained unpublished, so was not and still is not generally available. C. S. Wilson3presented an excellent paper on the Selection and Use of Screen Pipe, covering especially the allowable width of rectangular openings as related to screen analyses of formation samples. The methods of approach and the range of conditions investigated varied considerably. Variation in results as recorded as recorded by these observers was probably due to the degree of stability of bridging which each selected as a standard. Also the grain shape and angularity were not recorded or controlled, nor were their effects established. Therefore, a basis for correlation was not worked out.",,American Petroleum Institute

Smith(Tide Water Associated Oil Co.),,,,,,API-37-279,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"After recommending that the Institute'sCode on Field Care and Use of Pipebe followed, the author discusses improper methods of handling pipe from mill to consumer and in use of the pipe-giving in detail the damage resulting, which often causes unnecessary expense in well completions. Detailed suggestions are given regarding loading, unloading, field handling by truck, and protection of threads against sand and grit. The author gives torque and speed to be used when making up pipe Joints in the field, with cautions on removing grit, in use of lubricants to prevent galling, use of worn elevators, and in force to be used in handling long strings of pipe in a well. The paper is profusely illustrated with photographs showing damage that can be prevented by proper handling.Oil-country tubular goods have been abused so much in handling as to render of prime importance an immediate improvement in handling practices-which, if adopted, will effect a vast saving, to the petroleum industry. In furthering this interest, this paper is designed to present and illustrate the wrong methods employed, with resulting damage to pipe, rather than to lay down rules to be followed to accomplish good results- the published recommendations of the American Petroleum Institute Code No. 5: Recommended Field Practice for the Care and Use of Oil-Country Tubular Goods, dated July 1929, together with proposed revisions pending at the present time, in this regard being sufficient. Improper handling of tubular goods may rightly be covered under three heads : transportation, storage, and use. In the first two, both supplier and consumer are involved; in the third only the user is responsible.Transportation AbusesLoading and Unloading and in TransitThe abuse in handling tubular goods begins at the mills. In the loading and unloading of cars and ships, due care is not exercised to avoid damage to the threads or to the body of the pipe. There is, however, as we all know, a marked improvement as compared to conditions a few years ago. The threads of oil-country tubular goods are made to very close tolerances, the taper variation permitted being +0.0052 in. and -0.0026 in. per inch; and the American Petroleum Institute is considering the adoption of a pitch tolerance of &plusmn; 0.002 in. per inch. To insure a tight joint, it is also required that threads have full accurate form and height. It can be readily seen, therefore, that a very moderate blow on the threaded portion will result in a distortion of the thread to an extent greater than the variation allowed. Thread protectors are a necessary adjunct to the preservation of undamaged threads; however, experience shows that the threads can easily become damaged with the protector in position. In the loading of railroad cars, spacers or bracing are at times carelessly placed. Under such condition the load may shift longitudinally, allowing the end of the pipe to strike or rub against the end of the car, or even reach the nest car, with serious damage to the threads.",,American Petroleum Institute
241,320801,,Plant Pipe Reclamation,K.C. Hayes(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-37-288,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author discusses the reclamation of pipe and other oil-field tubular goods in established plants, as differentiated from the reconditioning of pipe lines in place stating that reclamation plants maintain an organized factory system in which the pipe is torch-heated internally to remove oil and protective coatings; furnace heated on continuous conveyors; then rust removed by steel-grit blast; then beveled for welding, and threaded for couplings; pits are filled by electric welding; then the pipe is straightened and sorted into four grades, the first being considered equal to new pipe, and the fourth being considered suitable for working pressures of approximately one-half those to which new pipe can be subjected.INTRODUCTIONThis paper covers the subject of reclamation of pipe and other oil-field tubular products, as carried out in regularly-established plants, but differentiated from the somewhat better-known practice of reconditioning pipe lines in place. The object of each method of reclamation is the same-to restore the usefulness of the material and to prolong the life. The plant method of reconditioning has proved to be very efficient, and the information given here is abstracted from practices now in use in plant operations. Severe corrosive conditions in existing pipe lines and the age of the material led the writer's organization, almost 10 years ago, to concentrate to a greater degree on the plant method, and to lessen the amount of reconditioning work done in place. Several rough semiportable installations were made that were capable of handling a considerable quantity of pipe during the reconditioning season; and, finally, a fixed plant was established, so located that pipe could be moved economically from any point in the system. Later changes in pipe lines, resulting in a decrease in oil conveyed in the original system, made available large amounts of pipe, and thereby emphasized the necessity of the plant method of reclamation in order to restore the full usefulness of this material. This additional available pipe made it necessary to enlarge the plant facilities and finally re-locate in more suitable locations to correspond with changing activities. Since the start of the plant method of reclamation, the total amount of pipe thus reconditioned has probably reached a total of 1,000 miles.IMPORTANCE OF OIL-INDUSTRY PIPEPipe occupies an extremely important position in oil-industry operations. This being a well-established fact, it is natural to assume that simple and efficient methods of reclaiming pipe would result in enormous savings. From time to time in the past quantities of used pipe had been periodically accumulated, necessitating disposal of some sort. The pipe often presented a very poor appearance; was very dirty, crooked, and rarely fit for use in the existing condition; and it had no apparent utility value to an oil company. The culling-out process, in an attempt to secure usable pipe without reclaiming, was very difficult, and often hazardous-resulting in sales at very low figures to scrap dealers. Development of these culling-out processes and repair methods has resulted in reducing the scarp sales to a very small percentage of the throughput.",,American Petroleum Institute

The program includes the development of standard instruments and practice for gaging tubular goods. This paper presents a critical discussion of the various instruments available for the purpose, and offers suggestions for incorporation in the proposed standard gaging practice.FOREWORDThe prevalence recently of deep-drilling operations in the exploration for and development of needed, additional supplies of crude oil has introduced new problems in the completion of wells. One of the most frequently- occurring and more serious of these is the setting of long strings of casing without leaks. As much as any other factor, this is responsible for the rapidly increasing tendency towards welded joints for casing; and, unless effective corrective measures are adopted, the welded joint, where it can be used without danger from fire, will most certainly replace the conventional threaded joint for casing as completely as it has already replaced it for line pipe. It has been quite definitely shown that part, at least, of the unsatisfactory performance of the threaded joints has been caused by variations in one or more of the dimensional elements of the threads greater than the permissible maximum tolerances. Undecided, however, is whether the present standard threaded joint, when in compliance with existing requirements, can satisfy the more exacting needs of current operations, or whether it will be necessary to increase them, include additional tolerances, or even make basic changes in the joint design. These points are now being investigated &sect; jointly by the engineers and manufacturers subcommittees of the tubular goods committee of the American Petroleum Institute, and this paper has been prepared to aid in standardization of methods for gaging pipe and in arriving at new tolerances that this joint investigation will undoubtedly prove are needed. The current importance of this problem to the oil industry provides the reason for the inclusion of numerous illustrations and descriptions which to many are undoubtedly common knowledge. For the same reason critical discussions of the relative accuracies and scope of application of the various instruments have been included.MASTER GAGES AND WORKING GAGESA brief consideration of the method by which sizes of pipe and couplings are established through the medium of master gages and various transfer gages will promote, perhaps, a clearer understanding of the problems involved in the gaging of pipe, and a better appreciation of the accuracy that may be expected from such instruments. The plug gage is the master gage, and it is a physical duplicate of the theoretically-correct pipe threads except for the substitution of a square-shouldered groove for the vanishing threads; it is made, therefore, to specified dimensions for pitch diameter, thread form, taper, pitch, etc. The inside face of the groove represents the location of the last scratch of imperfect pipe threads.",,American Petroleum Institute

Kitchel(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-37-323,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"In the past several years the steam demand of the drilling rig has increased appreciably, and manufacturers of steam equipment and auxiliaries have made many improvements in an effort to keep the power plant abreast of the demand. Inasmuch as economy is now of greater importance, the over-all economic operation of the steam plant is being given more consideration. In some cases improvements and new developments were accompanied by difficulties which have been, or are now being, eliminated. Manufacturers have been hindered to some extent in making improvements because of the misconception, on the part of some operators, of the term boiler horsepower and its determination on the basis of 10 sq. ft. of heating surface being equal to one boiler horsepower.INTRODUCTIONSteam, due to its flexibility in being readily adapted to all of the power operations coincident with drilling, has long been recognized as the most desirable form of power drilling service. During the past years the steam demand of the drilling rig has increased appreciably, and manufacturers of steam equipment have had constantly to make improvements to meet this demand and at the same time ward off competition from other forms of power. New developments, such as the integral superheater boiler and the separately-fired superheater, have been introduced; also improvements have been made in the saturated boiler and in auxiliary equipment. In order that some of these improvements might be better appreciated, and some of the difficulties arising with the use of this more modern equipment be better understood, it is perhaps worthwhile to analyze and discuss the most important of these developments. Some of the points considered have been dealt with in previous papers by other authors, and many are well understood by the majority of operators: however. as steam will probably remain the most commonly-used source of power for drilling service, a review of these points might be beneficial. Prior to 1929-which year marked the advent of superheated steam for drilling service-few changes, other than a gradual increase in the size and rated working pressure of the boiler, were being made toward improving the steam-generating plant. In most cases the steam demand was low, and a reasonable number of. boilers would supply an abundance of steam to the rig; consequently, little attention was paid to the steam generating capacity or the economic operation of the plant. Occasionally, as the manufacturers felt that a larger boiler was needed, they made a boiler with longer flues to obtain more heating surface upon which its size was rated, and working pressure. Since each enlargement of this nature resulted in a noticeable increase in power at the rig, it was not apparent at the time that there was probably a limit to beneficial flue length with the available draft, and that the noticeable increase in power was largely due to the higher pressure. From the standpoint of cost and weight, it was much more advantageous to add heating surface by increasing the length and, in some cases, the number of flues than by increasing the size of the firebox.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hogaboom(Petroleum Equipment Co.),,,,,,API-37-336,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"This paper presents the recommendations of the California Subcommittee on Multi-cylinder Gas-Engine Maintenance, and is a summary of detailed discussion held during the course of eight sessions during the year 1936-37 under the chairmanship of Henry Grinnell. The recommendations made herein may be easily applied in the oil fields. Control of cooling-water temperatures is claimed to be a major iten1 in maintenance--higher temperatures being recommended. Lubricating difficulties are minimized by the higher operating temperatures; oil sludging is eliminated. Starting difficulties are carefully analyzed, with recommended procedure in locating trouble. Ignition and carburetion demand the bulk of field maintenance, and detailed procedure is outlined to minimize the cost of this work. Personnel requirements are briefly discussed, and figures presented on operating costs as established by experience to date.INTRODUCTIONThis paper compiles the results of discussions on the operation and maintenance of multi-cylinder gas engines as recently developed after 28 years of meetings on this subject in a committee of 11 members, assisted by others in sessions with an attendance of from 45 to 60 interested operators and suppliers. Prior to affiliating with the American Petroleum Institute, the committee had done a large amount of work to determine the effectiveness of the intake manifold-vacuum gage as a measure of engine horsepower. Inasmuch as correlation of engine horsepower with actual loads is an important item affecting field maintenance, it has been decided to present the conclusions before proceeding with the general topic of this paper. These are:That, with ignition and carburetion properly adjusted, the manifold vacuum can be used in measuring the indicated power of the engine, but not the developed power.That, with a portable Prony brake dynamometer, vacuum gage, and tachometer, a very close approximation can be obtained of the horsepower developed by an engine installed in the field (see Fig. 1). However, repetition of tests of a large number of engines has proved quite conclusively that, due to the various internal and external changes which take place in an engine under continuous operation, a horsepower curve plotted against manifold vacuum and speed cannot be assumed to be at all accurate beyond the limits of a single field test. Thus a permanent installation of a manifold-vacuum gage and tachometer cannot be used to give continuous indications of horsepower output.That, with proper indicating instruments and an especially-developed device to give simultaneous, instantaneous readings of speed, manifold vacuum, Prony brake scale and polish-rod position, it is possible to plot very good curves of the horsepower output of the engine during the complete pumping cycle of the well (see Fig. 2).Brake Horsepower-Manifold Vacuum4-Cylinder Engine, 350-Cu.-In.

It was finally decided not to be concerned with selection or design but, assuming that the engine has been properly selected for the required load, to concentrate upon forming a practical guide for operation and maintenance. ?",,American Petroleum Institute

Anderson(Texas Creosoting Co.),,,,,,API-37-347,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The extension of oil-field activities into the marsh and shallow-water areas along the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast has developed the problem of special foundations to serve drilling, production, and pipe-line operations. This paper discusses the classification of marshes; the types of foundations in use; the factors governing the design of foundations and their limitations; and the selection of timber materials and treatment for use in these foundations. The authors endeavor to point out the limitations of present-day practices and the need for concerted efforts on the part of the operators in developing more detailed information for adequately meeting this problem of foundation design.The extension of oil-field activities into the marshy areas along the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast has brought a new and vital problem to the operator's mind, that of designing adequate and economical foundations for supporting drilling and production equipment. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the conditions encountered in this area, and the means now being used to meet these conditions. The term foundations may be defined as any type of material or structure used as the supporting medium for operating equipment. A foundation is that manmade structure used to distribute the imposed load of the equipment and vertical operating forces over the natural supporting effect of the marsh. Marshes may be classified in three. groups: 1, semi-marsh- soft land with grass coverage, subject to frequent overflows by high tides or overflowing streams; soil loading limited to 1,000 lb. per sq. ft.; 2, wet marsh, soft oozy silt, generally covered by high grasses, under water, incapable of supporting man, soil loading limited to 500 lb. per sq. ft.; 3, open water, shallow depth limits the possible use of marine equipment, soil loading limited to 250 Ib. per sq. ft.TYPES OF FOUNDATIONSThree types of foundations may be considered in the selection of the proper type for marsh operations:Earthen fill.Wooden mats and superstructures.PilingCertain characteristics of marshes are valuable in their supporting effects, and are generally considered in the foundation design. The grass and grass roots covering most marshes are of particular value, as they afford a means of holding the loosely-packed silt in place under the mat. For this reason practice dictates that neither the grass nor the grass roots be removed from the location where a mat is to be used; instead, the grass is bent over and the mat laid on top. The second characteristic of value is the freezing effect of loose silt upon piling, particularly in those locations where hardpan is an appreciable distance below the surface. It has been found that piling, which will drive with a minimum drop of the, hammer, is capable of supporting an appreciable load after standing for 24 hours. By this means it has, been possible to keep the length of piling within the limits of supply and at a reasonable cost, whereas to have used piling long enough to reach hardpan would have been prohibitive or impossible.",,American Petroleum Institute

Fleetwood Jr.(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-37-370,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Due to the continuing increase of the number of trials in which oil men must appear as witnesses, it is important that those witnesses familiarize themselves with a few general principles which may be of assistance to them in presenting their testimony. It is almost impossible to find such guide for prospective witnesses, although there are many works having as their objective the assistance of attorneys in presenting their cases. A person expecting to be a witness in a case has the responsibility of becoming acquainted with the entire case and with his part in it by discussing the case in detail with the attorney before trial. In this manner the witness can prepare himself properly for both direct and cross examination. The witness has certain general duties, which are: To testify responsively, audibly, understandably, and respectfully. The principal duty of the witness is to testify with absolute truthfulness. The witness also has certain rights, such as: To depend on the court and counsel for proper protection and guidance; to have questions simply and properly phrased; to refuse to answer in the absence of knowledge; to answer fully and with proper explanation; freely to admit having discussed the case with others; and to deliberate briefly before answering any question. All of the duties and rights mentioned above apply to all witnesses, but particularly in the oil industry the expert witness is of importance. He has even greater responsibilities due to his supposed possession of unusual qualifications which expose him to cross examination of great latitude. By the study and retention of such general rules of guidance, as herein mentioned, the potential witness should be better able to testify with greater credit to himself and to the litigant, and will thereby be able to further the ends of justice.In the ever-rising sea of litigation, the oil industry is constantly becoming more engulfed. The courts of both branches of government, as well as the numerous commissions and bureaus supported by each branch, claim more and more time of the oil executive or technician, and the average man employed in the various offices and field departments of our industry.Privileges and ResponsibilitiesIt is unfortunate that so few of those who must participate in trials and hearings as witnesses have a sufficient understanding of their responsibilities and duties, and of their rights and privileges as such witnesses. Many volumes have been written for the assistance of lawyers in their preparation and presentation of their client's case before a court or commission. It is almost impossible to discover some simple guide for the benefit of the witness, who is just as important as the attorney in the average case. Due to the lack of experience on the part of the witness, and due to the misimpression created by theatre and current literature, there are many competent individuals who experience stage fright and near-fear at the prospect of being subjected to the anticipated whims and caprices of the attorneys in the case. The witness anticipates the merciless cross examination, the stern admonitions of the court, and the amused smiles of the spectators caused by his own embarrassment and confusion.",,American Petroleum Institute
247,320807,,One Way of Finding Oil More Cheaply,Parker D. Trask(U.S. Department of the Interior),,,,,,API-37-382,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Many millions of dollars are spent each year in trying to locate new oil fields. Adequate knowledge of source beds would materially lessen this cost of finding new pools. Source beds are rocks in the ground that contain the materials which generate oil; hence, in drilling for oil it is highly advantageous to know if source beds are present. The American Petroleum Institute since 1926 has been supporting a research project whose object is to develop adequate tests for recognizing these mother substances of petroleum. At present a very promising test has been found. It is called the nitrogen-reduction ratio, and is the ratio of the nitrogen content of rocks to the amount of chromic acid the rocks can reduce. Rocks that have low ratios seem much more likely to be source beds than those with high ratios. This ratio, however, is not an absolute test of source beds; but, as indicated by studies of rocks in Oklahoma and Kansas, it seems to be at least 65 and probably 75 per cent efficient. The ratio is being investigated intensively at present to understand more fully its usefulness and limitations.In the United States we are now taking oil from the ground at a rate of more than one and a quarter billion barrels a year. At present we know where there are about l3 billion barrels of oil that can be produced by current methods of operation. This does not, however, represent our entire supply of oil, as we are finding new fields all the time. Thus far we have been able to locate as much new oil, each year as is taken from the ground during the year. Can we keep this rate up? This year (1937) we shall probably produce about, 200 million more barrels of oil than last year. Shall we find that much more oil than we did last year? If so, we have to discover more oil fields than we did last year. There is just so much oil in the ground. All the oil that will be used in our lifetime has already been formed and is awaiting discovery. Each new field found, therefore, lessens the number of fields yet to be discovered. The fields that are easy to find have already been located. The hard ones remain. Locating new fields costs a great deal of money. Last year at least 80 million dollars alone was spent on dry wells-on wells that yielded no oil (Fig. 1)-not to mention the cost of geological and geophysical exploration before the wells were drilled. This 80 million dollars spent on barren wells is money wasted, unless the information obtained from the dry holes helps in finding favorable locations for the next wells. Any information that will lessen the number of dry wells drilled will decrease the cost of locating new oil pools and thus make it cheaper to find oil. One way of cutting this cost of discovering petroleum is to obtain more adequate knowledge of the occurrence and character of source beds from whose organic matter petroleum has originated.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-37-399,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The history and geology of the Fitts Pool of Pontotoc County are discussed by the authors in considerable detail. Outlining the development of the pool, the authors leave little of importance unsaid; and contribute a mass of information relative to reservoir characteristics, drilling operations, casing and cementing procedure, well completions, producing practices, acidization results, gasoline recovery, proration, water encroachment, brine disposal, and estimation of recoverable reserves.INTRODUCTION AND HISTORYThe Fitts Pool is located in southern Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, and covers the southeast corner of Township 2 North, Range 6 East, and most of the south half of Township 2 North; Range 7 East. The first commercial well in the pool was a gas well drilled by W. A. Delaney, Jr., on the A. J. Harden lease in the Northeast corner of the Southwest quarter of Section 30-2-7. The producing sand was in the Atoka formation, and the initial production was estimated a t thirty million cubic feet per day. This gas production, however, aroused little interest among oil men, and a general doubt was felt of the possibility of oil in commercial quantities in the area. This skepticism was well-grounded in view of the proximity of the area to the tightly folded and faulted Arbuckle mountains. Apprehension regarding the country was dispelled in July 1933, when E. H. Moore's No. 1 Wirick, SE SE SW 29-2-7, flowed 75 bbl. of oil per day from the lower Hunton lime. This well opened the Fitts Pool, and inaugurated a lease play and exploration that has spread to the Arkansas line. W. A. Delaney, Jr., tapped the Bromide reservoir for the first time in his Cradduck No. 2, Northeast corner 25-2-6, in June 1934. Ten months later, with the development of the Bromide horizon progressing rapidly, E. H. Moore added new impetus by the discovery of production in the upper McLish sands in his Mitchell No. 1, NW SW NW 31-2-7. In July 1935 the same interest's Atkins No. 3, SW NW NW 32-2-7, flowed more than 800 bbl. per hour on a pressure drill test to prove prolific production from the basal McLish or Wilcox sand. The Fitts Pool at present covers an area of more than 5,000 acres, and has more than 600 wells producing oil from one or more of the eight horizons (see Fig. 1). The sands and the number of wells producing from them are as follows:(available in full paper)SurfaceShales, sandstones, and sandy limestones of the Boggy formation of lower Pennsylvanian age compose the surface rocks over the Fitts Pool. A microscopic examination of this formation, as provided by well cuttings, shows it to be composed of fine-textured shale, mostly gray-green in color, with some maroon and drab, broken by occasional thin beds of fine-grained silty sandstones.Sub-surface: Pennsylvanian Rocks-Savanna SandstoneThis formation, if present in the Fitts Pool, has never been differentiated.McAlester FormationLying apparently unconformably beneath the Boggy formation and, in turn, overlying unconformably the Atoka beds, is the McAlester formation.",,American Petroleum Institute
249,320809,,Flow of Mixtures of Oil and Water Through Sand,F.B. Plummer(University of Texas)|J.C. Hunter Jr.(University of Texas)|E.H. Timmerman(University of Texas),,,,,,API-37-417,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"This paper reviews briefly the factors which affect the proportions of oil and water produced in wells; describes experiments carried out to test the proportionate yield of water and oil in fine-grained sand and explains how the addition of certain chemicals can reduce the flow of water. Cross-sections of sand cores are exhibited showing the shape of water cones developed around a flowing experimental well, and explanations are offered to account for the shapes of the water cone under different conditions of production. Addition of a soap solution to fresh water reduced the proportion of water produced approximately 70 per cent. The same solution added to salt-water brines reduced the per cent of water only about 10 per cent. It is concluded that the soap solution produces a thin film over the surface of sand grains, which reduces the flow of water. Inasmuch as the soap solution does not mix with the oil, it does not affect the production of oil. The lower result obtained in salt water is thought to be due to the inability of the soap to dissolve in oil-field brines. It is not claimed that the methods employed in the laboratory are directly applicable in field conditions; it is thought that the experiments may possibly lead to an explanation of certain salt-water production problems.Reduction of the percentage of salt water in oil wells is a major problem in oil production. More than twice as much water as oil is produced in the partly-depleted fields of the United States today. The economic loss due to increased pumping costs, handling of emulsified oil, and losses due to unrecoverable oil trapped by water m a sand fully justifies a thorough study of methods of reducing salt-water production. The results of the work by d'Arcy1a; King2; Fancher, Lewis, and Barnes3, Wyckoff, Botset, and Muskat4; and others have shown that, when water alone or oil alone flows through sand, the rate of production increases as the pressure, thickness, and permeability of the sand increases; and It decreases as the viscosity and distance the oil has to flow increases. Accordingly, a sand bearing both water and oil should, under constant conditions, produce water and oil in quantities that are proportional to the viscosities of the two fluids. It is well known, however, that i most fine-gramed sands these proportions do not hold. Due to interfacial tensions between the water and oil, to adhesion tensions between the liquids and the sand, factors commonly referred to as capillary phenomena, a much larger proportion of water than oil is obtained from fine-sand reservoirs It is also well known that in reservoirs having relatively coarse-gramed sand and rapid rates of flow the water cones around the well, and an abnormal percentage of water is produced. If the well in the coarse-grained sand is pinched m and allowed to produce very slowly, the cone is said to be depressed, and the proportion of oil to water is generally increased On the other hand, If a well producing from very fine-gramed sand is pinched in, an increase in the percentage of water production often results.",,American Petroleum Institute

Stalcup(Skelly Oil Co.),,,,,,API-37-422,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"The author first gives a brief description of the Panhandle Oil and Gas Field-which is approximately 125 miles long, with an average width of 20 miles, and which contains more than 1 1/2 million acres. Then follow estimates of oil and gas originally in place, production to date, and a detailed discussion of the waste-gas problem- this covering its magnitude, some of the principal causes, and ill effects. Then is given a resume of legislative and administrative efforts to find solutions of the problem-these covering ratable production and sale of gas, which failed under court actions finally resulting in the passage of House Bill 266 which, with results obtained there under, are discussed briefly, followed by a resume of the improvement to date from a conservation standpoint.Description of the FieldAlong the north flank of a covered, burled granite ridge crossing the Counties of Wheeler, Gray, Carson, Hutchinson, Potter, and Moore, and extending into portions of Hartley and Oldham, lies the great Panhandle oil and Gas Field of Texas. This tremendous reservoir is approximately 125 miles in length, and has an average width of 20 miles-attaining at one point a width of approximately 40 miles; it is approximately 10 miles wide at its narrowest point, it contains 1,510,227 acres. Of this gigantic reservoir, 1,104,283 acres are estimated to be productive of sweet gas, while the balance of 405,944 acres is productive of sour gas. Of the total reservoir, various geologists and engineers have estimated that some 150,000 to 200,000 acres are underlain with oil. The recoverable gas from the reservoir has been variously estimated as between 15 and 25 trillion cubic feet. Since these estimates were mostly made seven or eight years ago, and since that time the proven gas productive acreage has been Increased by nearly 200,000 acres, and considering the known withdrawal of gas to date, In connection with the known decline of 17 per cent in the weighted averaged pressure for the entire gas reservoir, it is probably conservative to say that at least 25 trillion cubic feet of gas is a reasonable estimate of the original volume In place. Approximately 6 trillion cubic feet of this gas had been produced from the reservoir as of January 1,1937, and at that time there were 1,311 producing gas wells with a daily potential capacity of 20,194,857,000 cu. ft. of gas, having a dally allowable of 1,348,955,000 cu. ft. Estimates of the original recoverable oil in place have ranged from 600,000,000 bbl. to 1,000,000,000 bbl , largely depending upon the date on which the estimates were made, or the conservativeness or liberalness of the estimator. Probably an average of these two extreme estimates, or 800,000,000 bbl., may be regarded as a reasonably conservative estimate. As of January 1, 1937, approximately 248,000,000 bbl. of this oil had been produced, and a t that date the field's 2,990 producing oil wells had a daily potentla1 capacity of 827,229 bbl. and a dally allowable of 69,110 bbl. From inception of operations to date, slightly more than 800 oil wells have either been abandoned or plugged back and converted Into gas wells.",,American Petroleum Institute
251,320811,,Proration of Allowable Oil Production,Lyndon L. Foley,,,,,,API-37-427,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1937,"Commercial production of oil as a fuel began in the United States on completion of the Drake well near Titusville, Pa., In 1859. Crude oil from springs and seepages had been used for illumination and lubrication before this time, but had not been developed extensively.Overproduction and CurtailmentThe first overproduction occurred in 1861 on completion of several flowing wells yielding 2,000 bbl. to 2,500 bbl. per day. The price of oil declined to 5 cents per barrel, which was a great hardship to the oil and cooperage industries. A great many similar periods of overproduction, with ruinously low prices, have afflicted the industry, and have led finally to the restriction of production to market demand. This has been done by voluntary agreement of operators, by proration of purchases on the part of pipe-line companies, and by orders of state regulatory bodies. Oil was transported originally in barrels, each producer hauling his own oil to market In wagons. Railroad tank cars were Introduced by the Baltimore and Ohio Rallroad in 1866 Pipe-line development began in 1865. A 60-mile line to Pittsburgh was completed in 1874, and the first pipe line to the Atlantic seaboard was completed In 1879 The development of oil-transportation systems grew beyond the means of small operators, and the control of transportation became an advantage which was sometimes used unfairly to the detriment of small producers of oil. It was inevitable that court decisions would protect small operators, and pipe lines engaged In the transportation of purchased oil were held to be common carriers, thus establishing the principle of ratable takings this led also to proration of purchases by the pipe-line companies in times of overproduction.State Regulatory LawsThe migratory nature of oil and gas in the ground was recognized by the courts,1and the so-called law of capture was applied to the ownership of oil and gas. The courts established In the case of The Ohio Oil Company v. Indiana2that the owners of oil lands could not operate wastefully to the detriment of their neighbors, and so established the police power of the states to prevent physical waste The Corporation Commission of Oklahoma promulgated a proration order ,for the Cushing field in 1914, which was probably the first such order by a state regulatory body.Curtailment by ProrationReservoir EnergyRestriction of production is desirable in many fields in order to prevent physical waste. Many fields utilize their reservoir energy more efficiently under restricted production. Conservation requires that the most efficient rate of production for such fields be determined, and that production be restricted to that rate. This restriction for conservation purposes necessitates an equitable allocation of the allowable production among the operators In the pool.Ownership in PlaceGranting the desirability of curtailing production to meet market demand, and granting that the states have the power to do so, there IS still a wide range of opinion as to what constitutes equity In proration. Many people have held the opinion that proration should give each operator an allowable production proportional to his probable recovery under unrestricted production. This consideration led to the use of well potentials as the basis of proration.",,American Petroleum Institute

Cannon(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-38-020,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"A method of presentation of laboratory filtration data is given, by which the individual factors determining filtration may be isolated and evaluated for any particular mud. The significance of each factor is discussed. Data on typical Gulf Coast muds are presented; and the effects of addition of weighting materials, chemical treatment, and variation of nature and amount of colloidal material are summarized.In view of the importance of filtration of water from muds, particularly in connection with the drilling of deep wells,1,2,3acurrent interest in wall-building properties of various clays, and the significance of the effect of infiltration of water upon oil-bearing formations,4,5it appears timely to introduce a method of interpretation of laboratory data on filtration. A resume of the effects of various substances on the filtration of an average Gulf Coast mud is also presented. Heretofore results of filtration tests have usually been expressed in volume of filtrate in one or more time intervals at a given pressure and temperature, and in thickness of the cake so deposited.2,3While this method of reporting results is of value, particularly with reference to field operations, it is desirable to have a more concise and systematic formulation of laboratory results-particularly if in such a method the various factors influencing filtration are indicated. Based upon Darcy's law, an analytic treatment of filtration in linear flow has been formulated by T. V. Moore.? The equation so developed has been found to express closely the experimental results obtained upon the time-volume of filtrate relation of a large variety of natural and synthetic muds at all pressures. The integrated equation has the form:(mathematical equation available in full paper)The following nomenclature is used (gram, centimeter, second, and atmosphere employed instead of English units for convention of expressing permeability of cake in darcys) :(mathematical equation available in full paper)As will be noted, the volume of filtrate per unit area at a given time is determined by the magnitudes of m and c. At the outset it may be stated that c is important in determining the course of filtration at small values of elapsed time, but its relative effect becomes less as &iquest; increases-until it is of no consequence at large values of &iquest;. Conversely, m is of little interest in the initial filtration, but is the controlling factor once an appreciable amount of cake has been deposited. The magnitude of m is determined by the values of &micro;, v, s, and R'. The viscosity of filtrate, &micro;, is relatively constant for natural muds at a given temperature. In certain cases, as in muds containing sodium silicate, the value of &micro; may affect the rate of filtration greatly; other substances which would increase the viscosity of the liquid phase might bring about this same effect. Inasmuch as m is inversely proportional to &micro;, increase of &micro; decreases amount of filtration in a given time. Increase of v, the sludge-filtrate ratio, also decreases the rate of filtration; however, in practice, for muds from any particular locality, unless the physical properties of the solid phase vary considerably, v usually remains within a narrow range.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-38-029,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The authors discuss the use of pulverized limestone as drilling mud in West Texas and New Mexico in porous dolomitic-limestone formations wherein bottomhole pressure is relatively low. Properties of limestone that favor its use for this purpose are given, as are results of actual drilling tests.In West Texas and New Mexico, where production is obtained from a porous dolomitic limestone, and where bottom-hole pressures are relatively low, it long has been, and is now (February 1938) customary practice to complete wells with cable tools or by rotary, using oil as the circulating medium-retained in the system through satisfactory and proper pressure-control apparatus. In both of these cases the usual practice is to drill down to the top of the producing horizon; then to set the oil string, usually 7-in. casing-after which the pay horizon is drilled. When cable tools are employed, there is additional cost for rigging up the tools and the laborious and dangerous process of drilling in while, in many cases, the well is making oil. When the well is drilled in with rotary tools, there is likewise an additional expense due to the pressure-control equipment and the general nuisance customarily involved when oil is the drilling fluid. Because of these two undesirable and costly methods of drilling in, a new system was sought. The new method, in addition to eliminating the undesirable feature of the systems in general use, likewise must be such that no injury whatsoever will occur to the producing zone. It was concluded that a rotary rig using pulverized chalk as the mud-forming solid would serve the purpose better than any other method, and when pulverized to proper fineness the chalk probably would have sufficient colloidal properties to permit the preparation of a mud-laden fluid that would not settle out too rapidly. Also, in view of the probability that there would be coarser particles that are not held in solution as in the case of ordinary drilling fluids, these coarser particles would cause the formation of bridges in a coarsely porous or cavernous medium which, in turn, would prevent the penetration of the mud-laden fluid into the voids. (This may be backsight.) A colloidal mud, of course, will seal a porous sand and prevent penetration of an appreciable quantity of fluid. Such a mud, however, generally will not seal over a producing medium such as the limestones of West Texas, which carry voids of appreciable size. When necessary, the chalk which had served to seal the pores of the producing zone could be removed later by acid treatment. It further was concluded that probably the material best suited to the purpose was the Selma chalk of Mississippi and Alabama, the nearest source of supply being the cement plant at Demopolis, Ala. In view of high or prohibitive freight rates on such a material from this substantial distance, this source of supply of necessity was eliminated from consideration. Failing this, it was considered that the next most likely material would be pulverized Austin chalk. This material is available at several cement plants in Middle Texas-although, as a matter of economy, it was concluded finally that the kiln-dried and pulverized cement mixture of Austin chalk and shale in the percentages approximating 80 per cent calcium carbonate, 15 per cent acid-soluble oxides and complicated silicates, and about 5 per cent insoluble silicates would serve the purpose.",,American Petroleum Institute

The presence of porous zones and their thickness may be determined on rotary wells by this method. Porous dolomitic limestone drills faster than impervious dolomitic limestone. There is a close relationship between drilling time and well potential in the Goldsmith Pool. The estimation of relative property values is made easier and more accurate by drilling time. Casing points, total depths, method of acidization, and the placing of nitroglycerin shots, may be determined by drilling time. It also furnishes valuable information for remedial work, such as plug-back depths, selection of packer seats, liner positions, and pipe perforations. The drilling-time record should be made an integral part of the information secured on rotary wells in those areas in which it is applicable. When accurately obtained, it furnishes valuable information to the engineer and geologist. The cost of keeping these records is practically nil.INTRODUCTIONDrilling time on rotary wells is being used to advantage by many operators in the Permian Basin. For example, drilling time is helpful in determining certain completion practices, such as the selection of casing seats, manner of acidization, shot positions, and the determination of total depths. Corrective work likewise is made easier. Plug-back depths, packer seats, and casing-perforation zones may be determined in part by drilling time. Due to the variations in the hardness of different formations, drilling time has proved to be a valuable correlative aid; and in the pay section in dolomitic limestone it can be used for the relative evaluation of properties. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate the value of drilling time in the interpretation of the pay section of dolomitic-limestone reservoirs. Other practical applications will be illustrated. All examples are taken from the Goldsmith Pool, Ector County, Texas, which may be considered typical of dolomitic-limestone reservoirs in the Permian Basin.Drilling-Time ProcedureDrilling time may be defined as the time required to drill a certain interval. One-, two-, five,- and ten-foot intervals may be used; however, one-foot intervals in the pay section give a more detailed picture. The kelly is marked off with paint according to the desired interval. The time is recorded as each mark reaches the rotary table, and the number of minutes required in drilling the interval is determined. Each mark on the kelly corresponds to the present drilling depth. Ordinarily, the driller has one of his helpers take care of the drilling-time record. The drillers are asked to maintain a constant weight on the drill stem, and to rotate at an even speed. Usually 5 to 6 points less than the pick-up weight is carried on the drill pipe, and a rotary speed of 50 to 60 r.p.m. is maintained. Mechanical difficulties in some cases will interfere with the results and accuracy of the drilling-time record. Junk or loose iron on the bottom of the hole, or a locked cone on a bit, naturally will result in slow drilling, regardless of the hardness of the formation. Even with certain human and mechanical factors, drilling time is a good indicator of porous and non-porous dolomite.",,American Petroleum Institute

Alcorn(The Pure Oil Co.),,,,,,API-38-040,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The author describes briefly typical drilling locations in submerged areas, including marshland, inland lakes, and in the open gulf; and gives operating difficulties encountered in such operations, with comments on foundations and equipment applicable to the various types of drilling sites, including marine equipment such as houseboats, barges and tugs, the damage to structures by heavy storms, and the difficulties in changing crews during stormy weather. The relative numbers of marine wells in Louisinna and Texas in 1937 are given.I. CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED IN CONTACTING A MARINE LOCATIONThe Gulf Coast area is extremely low and flat, and contains many shallow inland submerged lands. In addition to the submerged lands there are extensive swamps and marshes which are not easily accessible, particularly with heavy drilling machinery. Due to the varying nature of the actual location for a well, it is necessary to analyze thoroughly the topographic conditions of the area in which the well is to be drilled. A recent paper1aby Herbert and Anderson covered in excellent detail the classifications of different structures and their adaptibility to various soil conditions. Foi purposes of illustration, the present writer here cites three specific marine situations with which he is familiar, and which typify extremely varied types of marine operations. In one instance the well was located about 3 miles from the mainland in about one or two feet of water, which rendered it very inaccessible. Obviously, the shallowness of the water was a decided disadvantage, being much too shallow for the movement of boats ant1 barges. In order to render this location accessible, it was necessary to carry on negotiations for the building of a dock and the dredging of a canal from the dock location to the well location. This necessitated the movement of 60,000 cu. yd. of material in dredging the canal, which was 50 ft. wide and 4 ft. deep, measured from mean low tide (Fig. I). Fig. 3 shows a similar condition with Fohs Oil Company, who operate their Lake Long Field in Louisiana via a canal coming off the intracoastal canal. Much of the Bird Island dredging was in hard-packed sand, and a portion of the canal required blasting. Variations of this condition might be a situation in which the well is located in a few inches of water, and wherein the construction of a board road to it would be the most practical way of contacting it (Fig. 4). With the second type of marine location, which is probably the most frequent type, the well location was in one of the inland lakes. These lakes are quite numerous, particularly in the Louisiana Gulf Coast. As a rule, most of the lakes are between 4 ft. and 7 ft. in depth, which is sufficient to carry on a marine-drilling operation with tugs and barges which require a minimum water depth of approximately 4 ft. This type of location, however, represents the easiest and most economical of the marine locations in which to conduct operations, it being necessary to construct a loading dock at some convenient point and handle all of the movement of men and materials with a minimum of effort and expense.",,American Petroleum Institute

Doherty(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-38-047,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"As of January 1, 1938, the Permian Basin proper has produced more than a billion barrels of oil from 10,310 wells-9,411 producing wells as of the same date; it has twice that amount of oil in reserve. The daily production, as of the same date, is 300,000 bbl., with 376 rigs drilling. There are many drilling and production problems peculiar to this area. All drilling is done with rock bits, and the type of reservoirs include combined active water- and gas-drive, gas-drive, and those requiring artificial lift at discovery. The area constitutes one of the most prolific oil reserves of the world.GEOLOGY AND STATISTICS OF THE PERMIAN BASINThe West Texas Permian Basin is roughly an ovate feature some 800 miles long and approximately 300 miles wide. It extends from Kansas on the north to Central Terrell County on the south, and from Tom Green County on the east to the Guadalupe and Sierra Diablo Mountains of Culberson County on the west. This discussion, however, is limited to that portion of the basin south of the Amarillo fold, and is specifically concerned with the south-central part of that area. This southern part of the feature is divided into two portions by the Central Basin platform, a long comparatively- narrow platform-like feature which extends from the Hobbs-Monument producing area of New Mexico to the Yates Field in Pecos County. The Delaware Basin, the center of which is in Reeves County, lies west of this platform, and the main or Midland Basin is situated to the east of the feature (see Fig. 1 and 2). To date, the greater part of the oil produced has been obtained from the upper few hundred feet of the Permian limestone, on local folds situated on the margins of the Central Basin platform. The Ward and Winkler Fields, and the Jal, Cooper, Eunice, and Monument Fields of Southeastern Lea County, furnish almost a continuous belt of production along the western edge of this platform. Most of this production is from cavernous dolomite, the porosity probably due to solution cavities. However, parallel and adjacent on the east to this line of producing structures, a large belt of sand production now is being developed. Part of the Ward production, the Halley, Emperor, and Kermit Fields in Winkler County, and the Mattix, Skelly, Penrose, and Hardy Fields of Lea County, are in the sand belt. The sandstone is in the top of the dolomite section, and grades imperceptibly into the pure dolomite to the west. The producing area is sometimes continuous from the sand belt westward to the dolomite fields. The Yates, McCamey, University-McElroy, Waddell, Judkins, Foster, North Cowden, Fuhrman-Deeprock, and Means Fields are located along the eastern edge of the platform. The Seminole Field in central Gaines Country and the newly ?discovered Wasson area in northwest Gaines and southwest Yoakum Countries are possible on the northern continuation of the east rim of the platform. Porosity is mostly in cavernous dolomite, although in the northern fields the pay is often in granular to crystalline dolomite.",,American Petroleum Institute

The territory comprises approximately 45,000 acres. The drilling is being done with cable tools. The country is of extremely rough topography. Approximately 120 days arc required to complete a well. The total depth of the wells averages about 5,000 ft. The original open flow of the average well is about 5,000,000 ft. The original rock pressure tarries between 1,900 lb. and 2,000 lb. The average cost of a completed well, including connecting line and meter, is approximately $30,000 The natural gas has a heat value of approximately 1,100 B.t.u. per It. The wells make a large quantity of condensate between 400 gal. and 500 gal. per 1,000,000 ft. This condensate has a gravity of approximately 65 deg.

Suggestions for further investigation art. offered in the compilation of a chart showing the relation of pressure and temperature and condition of water vapor at the varying operating pressures. In view of the large number of small tracts, it appears that serious consideration should be given to adequate spacing of wells to permit a proper return on invested capital, and to insure orderly development consistent with the probable reserves-giving due consideration to the equity of the Iessor, lessee, and the marketing company, so that development may be limited to consolidations or unitizations of the smaller tracts.DRILLINGIn the Kanawha County Oriskany Field (Fig. 1) the present proven territory comprises approximately 45,000 acres. In this area there have been (to February 1, 1938) 222 wells completed, of which all but 15 have been productive. The drilling of all Oriskany wells has been done with cable tools. Thought has been given to rotary drilling; but, after due consideration of all factors involved, it is the consensus of the operators that the cable-tool method is probably the best adapted for drilling in this area. The average depth of the wells is 3,000 ft. The average cost of each completed well is $27,000 (not including meter, separator, connections, etc.) making the average cost $5.40 per foot, which includes maintenance of rig, fuel, and casing and tubing used. The normal time for completion of a well, from staking of the location until the well is completed, is 120 days the time being distributed as follows:(available in full paper)The rate of drilling speed, after the well is spudded, averages 50 ft. a day-although in the shale section below the Big Injun sand 100 ft. of new hole per day ordinarily is made. The first 1,500 ft. is practically all said formation to the top of the Mississippian lime. This formation stands up well, and no trouble is encountered from caves. It is customary to set 88-in. casing on top of the Mississippian lime; however, where water may be expected in the Big Injun sand, the Mississippian lime is drilled with a hole full of water, and the 81-in. pipe landed below the Big Injun.",,American Petroleum Institute

In order to investigate the practical importance of these effects, four wells were completed in the latter part of 1937 in the Dominguez Field by the Union Oil Company of California--using oil and gas as circulating fluids, and attempting to maintain a drilling in pressure less than the formation pressure. These completions were made in the first and second Callender zones in the middle Pliocene and in the seventh zone in the upper Miocene. The first and second Callender zones had been subjected to considerable depletion, as they had been produced almost continuously since their discovery in 1924. Their original formation pressures had declined from 1,700 lb. per sq. in which is equivalent to the hydrostatic head from the surface, to 700 lb. per sq. in., the currently-measured bottom-hole pressure at the locations in question. The seventh zone, which has been produced since 1934, had declined in bottom-hole pressure from an estimated 2,500 to 1,500 Ib, per sq. in. The thicknesses of the intervals drilled varied from 159 ft. to 489 ft., and were interbedded sands and shales of varying degrees of hardness and texture; they averaged 62 per cent sand. Individual sand strata varied in thickness from a few inches to 80 ft. The interval for these completions was predetermined by offset requirements. For this reason no particular effort was made to evaluate the relative productivity of zones within these intervals. Only two formation tests were made, and these were taken while drilling the first well.MECHANICAL EQUIPMENTThe mechanical equipment involved in a pressure completion differs from ordinary drilling practice only in that facilities must be provided to handle oil and gas under pressure. These facilities must provide a means for: 1, introducing oil and compressed gas into the drill pipe; 2, a packoff arrangement between the drill pipe and casing; and, 3, separating oil and gas and drilled cuttings prior to the re-introduction of oil and gas into the system.Typical Pressure-Drilling Flow Diagram-Dominguez Oil Field, March 1938.

It is the purpose of this report to discuss the methods and equipment used in measuring depths, the errors arising from the different practices, and to consider recommendations for standardizing the technique of measuring well depths.History of the InvestigationIt was realized at the outset that the practices observed in measuring well depths varied between sections of the country, between the various companies, and even between districts in a given company. To become acquainted better with the procedure involved, questionnaires were sent to members of the Committee on Drilling Practice, with splendid response-replies having been received from 18 companies engaged in the drilling of oil wells. Three companies rendering services requiring the use of special measuring devices also submitted replies to that part of the questionnaire pertaining to their work. With such material as a background, a preliminary report was made to the Institute's Committee on Drilling Practice at the November 1937 meeting in Chicago, and was later made available to other drilling operators and technical bodies. The criticisms and discussions gained from these contacts are embodied in this paper.Problems of Well-Depth MeasurementThe study of well-depth measurement involves three fundamental problems:The selection of some standard method of measuring vertical distance below the earth's surface that would he accurate and reliable.The most accurate method of measuring tubular goods into wells, and correlation of this method with the standard method of depth measurement.The correlation and relative accuracy of special measuring devices employed in the measurement of well depth.Well depths cannot he measured by any procedure wherein all errors may be determined and corrected, for reasons that will be discussed later; therefore, some acceptable substitute for absolute depth must be used.

Examples of typical pump-dynaqraph and polished-rod cards are illustrated and explained.INTRODUCTIONThe costs involved in deep-well pumping and the force of competition of other methods of production have led to intensive studies of sucker-rod pumping practices. It now generally is agreed that the determination of individual well characteristics is essential for maximum production efficiency. To facilitate diagnosis of pumping-well problems, a number of mechanical devices has been developed to furnish information on well performance and equipment operation. Many of these instruments originally were designed for a definite and limited purpose, but since have been found to furnish a wealth of additional useful information. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the interpretation of information contained in the records made by pumping-well testing instruments, viz.:The pump dynagraph.The polished-rod dynagraph.Sub-surface pressure recorders.Fluid-level determining devices.Inasmuch as descriptions and general uses of each instrument to be discussed have been presented in former publications (refer to bibliography) the present paper will cover very briefly the general applications of each, and will emphasize recent developments or previously unpublished information.PUMP DYNAGRAPHMost recent of the important well-testing instruments is the pump dynagraph, which records plunger movement and variations in plunger load. The ideal card in Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of the component forces acting at the bottom of the rod string. The successive steps in the recording of a pump-dynagraph card are:At the start of the upstroke, the traveling valve closes (point A).From A to B, gas in the clearance space expands from static pressure in the tubing to entrance pressure at the pump; and the fluid load is picked up by the rods as the gas in the clearance space expands.Standing valve opens at B, allowing fluid to enter the pump when pressure in the pump drops below entrance pressure.From B to C, the fluid load is carried by the rods as fluid is drawn into the pump.At C, the standing valve closes as the plunger starts downward, with the traveling valve remaining closed.From C to D, gas in the pump is compressed and fluid load is transferred from rods to tubing.At D, the pressure in the pump becomes equal to the static tubing pressure, and the traveling valve opens.From D to A, fluid is displaced through the traveling valve into the tubing.Fundamental Pump-Dynagraph Card. FIG. 1(available in full paper)The pump dynagraph is used in studies of equipment operation and well performance. For complete analysis of pumping action, a sub-surface pressure recorder should be used with the dynagraph.

K. Parks,* chairman). In accordance with the favorable response to this proposal, the project was approved May 31, 1937 by the Executive Committee of the Central Committee on Drilling and Production Practice at the Institute's mid-year meeting in Colorado Springs. General plans of the proposed investigation were discussed, August 16, 1937, at a meeting of the California District Subcommittee, and on May 3, 1938 an Administrative Committee (E. P. Tallant ?, chairman) appointed to conduct the testing, prepared an outline of procedure. Actual testing began June 10, and was completed September 9, 1938. The data contained herein were presented originally at the Nineteenth Annual Meeting of the Institute at Chicago, November 15-18, 1938, as prepared for the committee by E. K. Parks and M. G. Arthur. Following presentation of the original report, the committee conducted further investigations in order to correlate the data of the experiment. It re-tabulated the observations in greater detail in the correction for temperature; compared results with experiments on steady flow through standing valves; and revised several of the figures. To avoid repetition of tables and figures, it was decided to substitute this revised presentation of the original data.DETAIL OF TESTINGDescription of ApparatusThe investigation of pump performance was conducted in a system employing a shallow well and surface pressure equipment. The oils tested were circulated in a closed system having an arrangement shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 and 3 show the arrangement of the surface equipment. Oil from the tubing outlet on the Thompson-type tubing head, with which the well is equipped, flowed past a surge chamber which was made of a 20-ft. joint of 6-in. pipe. This surge chamber was set in a vertical position, and swaged at its bottom end from 6 in. down to a tee in the 2-in. flow line. The upper end of the surge chamber was connected to a 1/2-in. pipe which led to a 1,500-lb. recording pressure gage. After passing the surge chamber, the fluid flowed past a riser on which was connected a 2,000-lb. dial pressure gage and a pressure-relief valve which was set to blow off at 1,750 lb. per sq. in.",,American Petroleum Institute

Analytical discussion develops a method for attacking the problem. Practical results and calculated results are compared and discussed. From the point of view both of practical experience and the analytical method, the author discusses rodline pumping in general and as applied to back cranking in particular.BACK-CRANK PUMPING AND ROD-LINE PUMPINGIn observing the various installations for back-crank pumping, one is impressed by the variety of sizes of equipment for the same pumping conditions. A little investigation soon will disclose that there does not exist a uniform method of selecting that equipment. It appears that the horsepower method most commonly is used. Beyond selecting the prime mover, the horsepower method is full of snares, and accounts for some of the failures from overloads which have occurred all too often. Inasmuch as there is an infinite number of combinations of force, distance, and time which will make one horsepower, it follows that force cannot be a measure of horsepower, or vice versa. The equipment to be selected for use between the prime mover and the bottom of the well is determined by force alone, and has nothing whatever to do with horsepower. This statement is so elementary that one would feel presumptive to state it if it were not for the fact that it is being misapplied constantly in backcranking problems. Another popular method of selecting this class of equipment is to choose the smallest and, therefore, the lowest-priced equipment that any salesman, badly in need of an order, hopefully will recommend or guarantee. Just how that guarantee is to diminish the forces involved or to contribute invaluable physical properties to materials has not yet been learned. Improper selection of equipment is destined to cost the entire oil industry, both manufacturer and producer, an enormous sum. It is the purpose of this paper to arouse interest in this problem, and to present the author's thoughts and experiences as his contribution to a better understanding of this problem. The selection of equipment must begin with the pump at the bottom of the well. The depth and the quantity of fluid to be lifted must be known first; then the time in which this quantity of fluid is to be pumped, whether in 24 hours or some part thereof. Obviously, if the well is to be pumped only 6 hours per day, the equipment will be larger and more expensive than if the same quantity of fluid is to be lifted in 24 hours. This time consideration is a common oversight. The producer often specifies equipment for, say, 50 bbl. per day; but, upon investigation, it is found that he intends to pump this quantity in 5 hours in order to save labor cost; actually he intends to pump at the rate of 250 bbl. per day for 5 hours. Often he is surprised at the size and cost of the equipment recommended, and insists that something must be wrong; for 50 bbl. per day should not require much equipment.",,American Petroleum Institute

The author presents the cost of operating and maintaining engines in pumping service as experienced by one California company. Operating costs are shown for various sizes of engines, and factors influencing them are discussed briefly. The importance of a competent maintenance personnel is stressed.At the present time approximately 2,500 multi-cylinder gas engines are used for pumping oil wells in California. In 1932 there were less than 50. This rapid increase is due both to the low first cost and operating economy of multi-cylinder gas engines and to the development of individually-powered portable pulling equipment which permits the used of lower-powered engines for pumping service.Summary of Operating Costs- Multi-cylinder Gas Engines. FIG. 1(available in full paper)Multi-cylinder gas engines were first used in California during 1930. About this time small operators began to use old automobile engines on their wells. These engines proved to be surprisingly dependable and economical to operate, and in 1932 the industrial-engine manufacturers entered the field. Engines of many types and sizes are now used. Sizes range from 100 to 800 cu. in. in displacement, with four, six, or eight cylinders. Loads as low as 5hp. and as high as 75hp. are being carried economically- using, of course, the proper size engine for the job. Four cylinder, 250- to 400-cu.-in. engines predominate, but the present trend is toward six-cylinder engines because of their wider speed range and higher horsepower output per cubic inch of displacement.Operating CostsFig. 1 is a summary of the operating costs of multicylinder gas engines as experienced by a California company. This company operates more than 250 engines in pumping service, has a trained maintenance personnel, and keeps accurate cost records. All of the engines are of the four-cycle type, and four different makes are represented. The costs shown are based upon lubricating oil at $0.68 per gallon, repair and maintenance labor at $1.20 per hour, parts as billed, and fuel (dry gas) at $0.10 per 1,000 cu. ft. The engines have been grouped according to size and number of cylinders, and the operating costs are shown as averages per engine per day. Two totals are shown; one includes all operating costs except fuel; the other includes all operating costs as well as fuel. This was done because in some fields gas fuel is not a true expense, but merely a bookkeeping charge; while in others the cost may be some figure other than $0.10 per 1,000 cu. ft. The column entitled range in which 68 per cent of the engines fall is the dispersion or standard deviation of the cost data fitted to a normal distribution curve, and has been included in order to show the spread of the individual costs making up the average. It amplifies the average, and means that 7 out of 10 engines in the group fell within the indicated range. Formal statistical analysis was used to calculate the figures for this column. The calculations are omitted, because they are tedious and of little consequence in themselves.",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper is a presentation of a water-flooding project, including cost of development; a discussion and description of the mechanical equipment, the application of water, and oil-production results to date. Data are included to indicate the similarity of Bradford Field five-spot decline curves and the desirability of maintaining high water pressures, high rates of water input, and to illustrate the advantages derived from various innovations of automatic equipment and mechanical protective devices.INTRODUCTIONWater flooding an oil sand as an aid in the production of oil dates back to the early days of the oil industry almost to the discovery of oil; and is not, as frequently is presumed, a development of recent veal's. In the early days of drilling at Oil Creek, casing was unknown, and it was necessary to complete the wells through the sand wet. Frequently the short time necessary for completing a new well through the sand admitted sufficient water to start active flooding in nearby producing wells. One of the early enlightened references to water flooding was made by Carll1ain 1879. The flooding of an oil district is generally viewed as a great calamity; yet it may be questioned whether a larger amount of oil could not be withdrawn from the rocks in that way than by any other; for it is certain that all the oil cannot be drawn from the reservoir without the admission of something to take its place. In the Bradford and Allegany Fields of northern Pennsylvania and southern New York state water flooding as a common production practice has been singularly successful in restoring old abandoned areas to a profitable and economically important position. No attempt will be made in this paper to review and outline the history and development of water flooding as a means of oil production, but the purpose and object of this discussion is to describe a specific project with moderately detailed information concerning development costs and production results.DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENTFig. 1 is a map of a five-spot water-flood development in the Bradford District, subsequently referred to as Project B-2. This development includes a rectangular area of 80 acres with a north-south dimension of 1,820 ft. and an east-west dimension of 990 ft. The rectangular shape and dimensions of this area are admirably suited to a five-spot pattern with a water-to-water spacing of 880 ft., and includes 12 five-spot wells or squares of 2 1/2 acres each. The old wells existent on the property previous to the new development are numbered 1 to 8, inclusive. Water-intake wells are numbered 0-1 to 0-20, and the new five-spot oil wells are numbered A-1 to A-12. The development of this 80 acres necessitated the completion of 20 water-intake wells and 12 oil wells, or a total of 82 new wells. It should be appreciated that the entire cost of drilling and equipping the 32 wells cannot be charged to the 80-acre tract, for the line wells also will serve successive developments.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dean(General Petroleum Corp. of California),,,,,,API-38-267,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The Wilmington Field is described, and local practices are discussed-including use of directional drilling, multiple-zone completions, fine-mesh slotted liners, gravel packing, and special measures to combat erosion of sub-surface equipment. Attention is directed to the potential value of gravel packing as a means of solving the sand problem in this field.The Wilmington oil field is located along the shore line of the Pacific Ocean in the Wilmington-Long Beach Harbor District, approximately 20 miles south of the center of the city of Los Angeles. The structure is an anticline which is cut by several transverse faults. These faults form sharp lines of demarcation as to well productivity, oil gravities, edgewater limits, and gasoil ratios. The main portion of the field was discovered by the General Petroleum Corporation on December 6, 1936. On March 15, 1938, 15 months old, the Wilmington Field had a potential production of about 275,000 bbl. per day, and under curtailment was producing 128,000 bbl. per day from 390 completed wells. The cumulative production was 20,000,000 bbl. The proven portion of the field so far is approximately 3% miles long and 2 miles wide, with the south and southeastern limits as yet unproven.Productive ZonesFig. 1 is a diagram of the productive column showing the position, thickness, and general characteristics of the oil zones in the field at a high structural location, where the maximum thickness of the oil zone is found. This section is taken from the General Petroleum Corporation's Ford lease, located in the central portion of the field near the Long Beach-Wilmington boundary line. The uppermost zone is the Tar Zone, which is 200 ft. thick and contains about 60 per cent oil sand. The oil is from 13 deg. to 15 deg. API gravity, and carries from 2 to 2.5 per cent sulfur. Wells in this zone may produce from 50 bbl. to 200 bbl. per day; but this rate is only an estimate, because the zone is usually cased off, or is produced with the Ranger Zone. The Ranger Zone is approximately 500 ft. thick, and contains from 10 to 20 per cent sand-the thicker sand bodies being found on the flanks of the structure. Most of the oil is produced from the central portion of the zone; the top and bottom strata are primarily shale with thin streaks of oil sand. The sands are quite fine and unconsolidated. Sand troubles are common in wells producing from this zone. The gravity of the oil varies from 15 deg. to 24 deg. API, and contains from 1.2 to 2.2 per cent sulfur. Ranger wells vary in production from 100 bbl. to 2,700 bbl. per day, but the majority will have initial rates of less than 600 bbl. per day. Terminal Zone is the major producing zone of the field, and has a thickness of approximately 1,075 ft. Oil gravities, formation pressures, and consolidation of the sands increase with penetration into this zone which makes it advantageous from a producing standpoint to separate the zone into upper and lower Terminal at about the midpoint.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lewis(E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.),,,,,,API-38-278,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"Whereas the ideas on shooting here presented are comparatively new to well-shooting practice, the underlying principles are understood and widely used in other industries. In all basic mineral-producing industries the art of blasting has kept step with progress in other branches of such industries to a greater extent than in the petroleum industry. This is probably due in part to the fact that most other basic industries operate on or near the surface of the earth or under conditions where the results of a blast are visible and can be studied, and where the cost of explosives is a vital and continuous factor in the costs of production. In those industries, if one knows the characteristics of the various explosives available and the nature of the material to be blasted, by a simple arithmetical process he can predetermine, almost to the pound, what will be the yield of material blasted by a given quantity of a certain grade of explosive. Consequently, in these industries those responsible for production volume and cost must watch developments, having learned to appreciate that they must understand the composition and action characteristics of explosives-not only in order to select the proper explosive to give the kind of breakage desired, but also in order to use explosives to produce the desired breakage with the least drilling, inasmuch as the type of explosive and the manner of its use are vital factors in the number of drill holes required, especially in secondary-blasting operations. In the petroleum industry the factor of volume and cost of production is just as important as in other industries, but here knowledge of the art of blasting has lagged behind the other arts employed in every department of the industry. This is regrettable, and to some extent inexcusable, but apparently is due to a combination of misinformation and a lack of authoritative information which leaves the production man uncertain where to begin and how to formulate an intelligent course of procedure in an operation which often means success or failure, profit or loss-where often a fortune is at stake in a single well. The oil-well shooter is called upon to shoot hundreds of wells each year under every conceivable condition. In the vast majority of cases he is told-as he should be--to bring so many quarts of nitroglycerin, so many shells of a certain capacity and diameter, so many feet of anchor and a squib or a bomb, as the case may be, and he is told to shoot from one certain elevation to another. The torpedo company, in the majority of such cases, simply is engaged to render a mechanical service prescribed and specified by the well owner; consequently, such torpedo company endeavors to place and explode the shot according to specifications--conditions permitting. If the shooter knows from his experience that the shot as specified is not the kind or size of shot that will be most productive or least liable to cause damage, he can only call attention to his ideas-if he dares. Often, perhaps too often, he keeps his counsel, having found that advice is not always welcome.",,American Petroleum Institute
267,320827,,Factors in the Design of a Salt-Water Gathering System,J.E. Bailey(Tide Water Associated Oil Co.),,,,,,API-38-285,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The author discusses briefly several factors involved in transportation of oil-field brine, stating that brine from each well should be analyzed and material for handling it selected with necessary resistant properties. Stating that the major problems are to prevent corrosion and deposition of scale, the author then gives comparison of brines, and discusses briefly the design and construction of a salt-water gathering system.OIL-FIELD SALT WATERThe two main problems in transportation of salt water produced from oil and gas wells are: 1, the formation of a precipitate scale that clings to and clogs up the pipe; and, 2, the formation of a corrosive scale by the action of the salt water on the pipe. A clearer understanding of precipitate scale could be had by reviewing the conditions in which the salt water is found. Analyses of waters produced from oil and gas wells reveal that the waters contain from 3,000 to 268,000 parts per million of solids, of which usually the largest percentage is common salt (sodium chloride) ; hence, the term well known to the oil industry, salt water. There are other minerals in salt water which vary as to percentages with the analysis of water in each field, and even vary widely in the analyses of waters in the same field-more especially along fault zones and near salt domes. Experience has taught the average oil man that in most cases the deeper the hole as water-bearing formations are found, the saltier the water and the higher the temperature. The warmer the water, the greater the solubility and, hence, the larger amount of mineral matter that can be dissolved and held in solution. Increase of pressure to which the water is subjected also has the effect of increasing the solubility. Therefore, when salt water is produced from a well, the consequent reduction in temperature and pressure reduces the solubility, and solids may be precipitated. The oil and salt water are run into a separating tank, where the salt water is drawn off from the bottom through a bleeder line, which is elevated near the top of the tank. Here the salt water runs over into another pipe called a syphon, whose upper end is open to the air. As the salt water drops to the ground level, it mixes with air for the first time. The most important consideration is to keep the brine from becoming oxidized. In other words, no air should come in contact with the brine anywhere in the system. Once the iron, manganese, and sulfur compounds in the salt water are exposed to the air, precipitates are formed, and the brine becomes acidic. This mixture increases the corrosive qualities of the water, and sometimes causes precipitation on exposed surfaces. In this connection a closed-type salt-water system is explained in a recent periodical.1aSalt water that readily produces precipitate scale is usually high in parts per million of solids; it is this water that is difficult to handle. In some cases the precipitate scale forms so rapidly that it makes a protective coating for the pipe, thereby preventing corrosion of the pipe by the salt water. The bad feature of this condition is the rapid clogging of the lines, which have to be cleaned or replaced frequently.",,American Petroleum Institute
268,320828,,Experiments on Fluid Capacity and Plugging of Oil-Well Screens,R.L. Chenault(Gulf Research and Development Co.),,,,,,API-38-293,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"A number of tests were made on samples of various types and makes of oil-well screens to determine free flow characteristics, flow characteristics when packed in sand, conditions under which screens are likely to plug, and precautions necessary to prevent plugging. It was found that there is little relation between free flow characteristics and flow characteristics when packed in sand. In general, the pressure drop through a sandpack of any considerable thickness is so much greater than the drop through an open screen that variations of several hundred per cent above or below the average resistance of commercial screens to free flow are of little significance in predicting the fluid capacity of a screen and sand-pack under operating conditions. Screens of the wire-wrapped, slotted-pipe, and button types were tested; and in all cases the screening action was practically perfect-although in some cases about 60 per cent of the sand was small enough to pass through the screen openings. When circulating clean oil through a sand-pack and screen at a constant pressure, the rate of flow reached an equilibrium value, when the oil temperature and viscosity became constant, and remained at this value indefinitely-indicating that permanent sand bridges were formed almost immediately after starting flow. Several attempts were made to plug a screen and sandpack with drilling mud by placing layers of mud in various positions in the sand-pack, and by injecting mud into the oil inlet to the screen-testing chamber. It was found that the mud would not migrate more than 1/4 in. through the sand-pack before it was entirely filtered out by the sand. Surrounding the screen pipe with a porous filtering medium such as sand or gravel, which will fill the well cavity and prevent caving of the formation, and migration of mud or other colloidal material to the screen face, appears to be the most logical solution of the problem of screen plugging and sand production. References are made to methods now being used for placing gravel or sand-packs, and some new methods are suggested.INTRODUCTIONThis series of tests on fluid capacities and plugging of oil-well screens was undertaken to determine the relative merits of various types of screens commonly used, by testing under controlled conditions with equipment designed for simulating various situations assumed to exist in oil wells. All tests were made with samples of screens 6 in. in length and approximately 3 in. in outside diameter. Tests were first made to compare the free-flow rates of the various screen samples, and then the screens were installed in the apparatus for testing rates of flow when packed in sand-and these tests were continued for several days in each case.DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUSThe screen-testing chamber used for making sandpack flow and plugging tests is shown in Fig. 1, and consists of a 24-in.-outside-diameter x 3/8-in. wall pipe which serves as a container for holding an 18-in.-diameter perforated sand basket, in the center of which are mounted the samples of screens, their open ends sealed off with gaskets.",,American Petroleum Institute
269,320829,,Theoretical Consideration of the Perforation Pattern in a Screen Pipe,J.M. Cunningham(Gulf Research and Development Co.),,,,,,API-38-307,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The influence on the strength of varying the size, number, shape, and arrangement of the perforation in a screen pipe is discussed theoretically. The theory evolved is sufficiently general to apply the conclusions to both wire-wrapped and unwrapped screen. The screen must resist one or more stresses including bending as beam, compression, tension, columnar action, transverse compression, and radial thrust. Columnar action considers combined bending, compression and, indirectly, tension-permitting the influence of the perforation pattern with reference to these three types of loading to be studied simultaneously. Formulas are developed for the solution of the stresses in a column having an irregular cross-section. Tables and curves give the results of calculation made for 5-in.- outside-diameter and 6 5/8-in.-outside-diameter screens. The data are further considered with reference to variations of screen length, wall thickness, size of perforation, and working loads. Formulas are given for the analysis of the strength in resistance to transverse compression; and, without extensive calculation, the common perforation patterns are discussed. The round-hole, vertical, and horizontal-slot-type patterns are rated on their general strength in resistance to the various types of loading. It is concluded :For a given perforation area, the size, number, shape, and arrangement of the perforation will greatly influence the strength of the screen.The perforation pattern should be chosen to suit local field conditions in order to provide the maximum perforation area consistent with the strength requirement.Columnar strength represents a basis for selection of the perforation pattern.The optimum perforation pattern uniformly distributes the perforations both longitudinally and circumferentially. The perforations per row circumferentially will be a minimum, and the longitudinal rows of perforation will be a maximum. Sharp corners in perforations are to be avoided.A perforation pattern selected for high resistance to tubular collapse must have a maximum moment of inertia per unit of length of the minimum longitudinal wall section.INTRODUCTIONA study of the perforation pattern in a screen pipe discloses that the number, shape, size, and arrangement of the perforations will greatly influence the strength of the screen pipe for a given area of openings. The investigation of the perforation pattern was made primarily on wire-wrapped screens for the purpose of obtaining increased perforation area without seriously weakening the screen. However, the fundamental principles involved are applicable to unwrapped pipe, and thus the conclusions can be made for screen pipe in general. Wherever a wire-wrapped screen pipe is used in an oil well that has a tendency to produce sand and mud fines with the oil, a review of the field records will reveal that the small flow channels behind the wire wrappings rapidly become clogged to the point of ineffectiveness; and, shortly after the screen is in service, the only effective screen area will be the area covering the perforations in the pipe. Eventually even these areas may become clogged, but their susceptibility to clogging will depend upon their size and shape. With these considerations, any increase in the number or size of the perforations obviously will increase the probable effective screen area, and will, in effect, result in greater production before a shut-down and clean-out.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lacey(California Institute of Technology),,,,,,API-38-402,"Drilling and Production Practice 1938, 17-18 February, Amarillo, Texas",1938,"The prediction of the specific volume of homogeneous and heterogeneous complex hydrocarbon mixtures is of importance to the petroleum technologist. The partial specific volumes of each of the components in both the liquid and gas phases are of value in making such predictions. The partial volumes of the paraffin hydrocarbons from methane through pentane in the liquid phases of the various hydrocarbon systems that have been studied experimentally are presented in tabular form, together with similar information for two complex liquids. A tentative correlation of these partial volumes has been prepared to permit the prediction of the specific volume of naturally-occurring hydrocarbon liquids in the ranges of pressure and temperature that commonly are encountered in production practice. This correlation represents a preliminary attack upon one part of the major problem of the prediction of the volumes of hydrocarbon mixtures under widely-varying conditions.INTRODUCTIONThe specific volume of a phase is a function of all the variables which must be ascertained in order to establish the state of the phase. In most engineering work, pressure and temperature are chosen as two of these independent variables. Composition commonly has been accepted in petroleum practice as one of the independent variables which are used to define the state of a multi-component phase. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate the equivalent of the pressure, the temperature, and the weight fractions of all but one of the components present before it is possible to define the state of a phase. Inasmuch as even the simplest naturally-occurring hydrocarbon phase contains a large number of components, it is almost impossible to define strictly the state of these phases. In connection with the present correlation it has been assumed that the pressure, temperature, weight fraction of the components from methane through npentane, and a characterization factor for the combined material of greater molecular weight than npentane would suffice to define all of the properties of the phase in question. This procedure of considering the whole group of components of higher molecular weight as one constituent introduces uncertainty, but probably permits the description of a phase with sufficient accuracy to correspond with present knowledge of behavior. The use of partial volumes1ain predicting the volumetric behavior of complex hydrocarbon liquids appears to be of value primarily because of the simplification in the correlation which results from their use. The partial volume of each of the components of a mixture can be predicted with engineering accuracy in a simpler fashion than it is possible to predict the specific volume of the phase as a whole. This paper deals with the partial volumes of the paraffin hydrocarbons from methane through npentane in various hydrocarbon liquid phases. The experimentally-determined values for the individual hydrocarbon systems have been presented in tabular form as a function of pressure, temperature, and the weight fraction of the component in question. These values have been correlated in a tentative fashion so as to permit their use in the prediction of the specific volume of complex hydrocarbon liquids throughout the ranges of temperature and pressure that commonly are encountered in production practice.",,American Petroleum Institute

Heithecke(Bureau of Mines Petroleum Experiment Station),,,,,,API-39-053,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The authors describe a pressure core barrel that cuts a core of the producing formation in a well, and seals the core in an inner barrel while it is still at the bottom of the hole. This innovation in coring technique and procedure should aid in a better understanding of natural petroleum reservoirs and their behavior. The conventional method of coring productive oil formations brings a specimen of the reservoir rock to the surface of the ground; but during the process the pressure in the core is reduced to atmospheric, and the gas associated with the oil in the core expands and escapes. The expansion of the gas also drives part of the oil from the core. This loss of oil and gas from core specimens greatly has handicapped engineers in accurately estimating the fluid content of petroleum reservoirs. The new core barrel is essentially a conventional core barrel, with the addition of special valves at either end of an inner barrel and a mechanism for closing the valves while the barrel is at the bottom of the hole. Tests have been made in 5 different wells in which 17 cores were cut, 2 of which were cut and sealed at the pressure and temperature prevailing at the bottom of the drill hole. The pressure in the test wells ranged from approximately 1,000 to 2,700 lb. per sq. in. Although minor changes in the design of the barrel undoubtedly will be necessary to assure satisfactory operation in every respect, the tests indicate that a core barrel patterned after the present experimental barrel will recover cores under pressure. The authors give a detailed description of the pressure core barrel with the aid of drawings, the coring procedure used in the field, the method and equipment for analyzing the cores, the analytical results thus far obtained, and suggestions of factors requiring special attention.INTRODUCTIONRecovery of core specimens from sub-surface formations and their subsequent analysis are important aids in efficient development and operation of oil and gas fields. Core specimens first were obtained mainly for the geologic information they revealed; now they are analyzed to determine many of the physical characteristics and conditions of the sub-surface formations as well. Cores recovered from the producing formations may be analyzed for porosity, permeability, oil content, connate-water content, and other physical and chemical properties of the formation-all to the end of furnishing enough data for making reliable estimates of the quantity and availability of oil and gas within a reservoir, and in devising efficient means for their withdrawal. Examination of bottom-hole samples of oil gives valuable information concerning the amount of gas in solution in the oil within the reservoir, and the resultant shrinkage of the oil when the gas is released. Producing characteristics of reservoirs may be determined by means of sub-surface pressure and temperature gages, and measurements made at the well head; however, unless reliable core analyses are available, these data have only limited use in any quantitative study of reserves. In such a study the quantity of oil, gas, and water contained in a unit volume of the reservoir formation is extremely important.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sewell(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-39-069,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The author describes in detail his design of a pressure core barrel, and suggests several general uses. A log of the number of runs made by this core barrel is given, which indicates the ability of the barrel to recover a core under pressure sufficiently often for it to be considered a production tool. The author states that, with further experience, the percentage of core recovery should correspond to the recovery by a conventional barrel cutting a core of the same size. Tests are given which explain the reason for the pressures recorded by the core barrel being considerably lower than the computed static bottom-hole mud pressure.A pressure core barrel is a coring device which differs from conventional core barrels in that the core, after having been cut, is sealed within a chamber and brought to the surface under pressure. The primary purpose of such a core barrel is to prevent the loss of the contents of the core due to expansion as the pressure surrounding the core is reduced, thus permitting a more accurate determination of its original content.Core-Barrel ApplicationsA discussion of the entire field of pressure-core applications is beyond the scope of this paper; the more general uses include the following:A more certain determination of reservoir content than is furnished by the conventional non-pressure-type core barrel.Location of gas caps and determination of content.Studies of oil, gas, and water gradients through a producing zone.Studies in well spacing.Studies of oil remaining in place in depleted fields by drilling and coring intermediate wells.Studies of various methods and rates of production by working on cores while cores are under pressure.Studies of contamination of cores.Briefly, the Carter pressure core barrel may be described as a conventional core barrel containing a third tube between the inner and outer barrels. This third tube is provided with valves at both ends, and an arrangement for lifting the inner barrel containing the core up into it-after which the valves are closed. All of these operations occur at the bottom of the hole. Fig. 1 and 2 illustrate the principles of operation.Down the Bore HoleFig. 1-A shows the core barrel as it goes down the bore hole. At the lower end of the assembly, located in the central passage through the core head and extending up into the end of the core tube, is a plug which serves a double purpose. This plug is attached by one set of shear pins to the outer assembly, and by another set of shear pins to the core tube. By this means the core tube is held in a fixed position relative to the outer assembly as the core barrel is lowered into the hole. The plug also, as in a conventional core barrel, prevents cavings from entering the core tube. Attached to the upper end of the core tube and extending upward is a rod which has on its uppermost end a knob or boss.",,American Petroleum Institute

Extensive dynamometer data, in tabular and graphical form-covering depth; rod, tubing, and pump sizes; production; and related items for many individual wells-are included in the paper, making it a valuable source book of detailed information of this character.A. INTRODUCTIONThe dynamometer, as an instrument for analyzing well performance, has become a very important tool of the production engineer. The many factors which influence a dynamometer card require a highly-developed technique in the interpretation and application of the data and, in most cases, require supplementary data before a rational interpretation can be made. The application of dynamometer data to troublesome wells has been discussed frequently in the literature during the past few years. Some equally important applications which have not been discussed so thoroughly will be considered in this paper. Inasmuch as any discussion of dynamometer cards presumes a thorough understanding of the factors involved and their influence on the cards, this phase of the problem, likewise, has been considered in this paper.B. GENERAL APPLICATIONS OF DYNAMOMETER DATADynamometer data have applications during three phases of a well's history. The first general application is to the selection of equipment. The second application is to check operating conditions when equipment has been installed, to prevent trouble, or to improve operating conditions. The third is the application of dynamometer data to troublesome wells in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the trouble. Although this latter field of application has received much attention-and justly so-the others should receive more attention; for it is much cheaper to prevent trouble than to correct it. The problem of equipment selection is not at first, as might be expected, that of rating the equipment, but it is the more difficult problem of rating the well. The various Institute committees have developed specifications covering the rating of the various parts of pumping equipment. Recognizing that some method of rating the well is necessary, the specification on rating of speed reducers ? gives a suggested method of computing well loads. Equipment selection depends on load, torque, and horsepower requirements. The load requirements determine the size of sucker rods and the structural part of the pumping unit or front. The torque requirement determines the size of the reduction units and belts. Torque can be calculated from the well load and counterbalance, as will be shown later. The horsepower requirement determines the engine size and characteristics. As mentioned hereinbefore, the problem normally is one of determining just what the load, torque, and horsepower requirements of the well will be for the conditions under which the well will be operated. Proration has complicated further the problem, in that the requirements at various phases of the well's history may be very different. This variable condition requires a careful consideration of the behavior of the reservoir. The over-all equipment requirements may be affected considerably by production rates and reservoir pressure -depending on whether the reservoir has a gas or water drive and, in the case of a water drive, the effective",,American Petroleum Institute

Fulton(Union Producing Co.),,,,,,API-39-354,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"An apparatus is described for the visual as well as analytical study of gas-condensate phase relationships at bottom-hole conditions. Consideration is given to problems of sampling, and the precautions are described which must be taken in order that samples may remain representative of the well under the conditions obtaining at the time of sampling. The experimental procedure is described in detail, and an outline is given of the calculations necessary for recombination in the apparatus of gas and condensate in the experimentally determined ratio.Probably the most important single factor in the laboratory study of condensates is to insure that the samples of gas and liquid are truly representative of a well under the normal conditions. To this end the well is allowed to produce at the desired rate for a stabilization period of at least 24 hours before sampling. The sampling period itself may extend over the following 24 hours; during this period the gas flow is metered and the liquid production determined, preferably in the separator. The liquid samples are taken under separator pressure from the separator into steel cylinders, by downward displacement of mercury. Gas samples are taken at separator pressure from taps located at the blowoff on the downstream side of the separator. The containers are fabricated by welding from standard 10-in. pipe. They are provided with two valves, through one of which gas is allowed to enter until the container is at separator pressure. This valve then is closed, and the contents of the container are vented to the atmosphere through the second valve.Flow Diagram of High-Pressure Apparatus for Determining Phase Relations of Reservoir Conditions. FIG. 1(available in full paper)This process is repeated four times, after which the maximum contamination of the sample by air, or remnants of a previous sample initially present in the container, can be shown to be 1 part in 600,000. Five containers of gas are taken. A gas sample is analyzed by Podbielniak low-temperature fractionation for all hydrocarbon constituents lighter than heptanes (Fig. 1 and 7); nitrogen is determined by interferometer in the methane fraction, and carbon dioxide by absorption in potassium hydroxide. Laboratory analyses are made on 50-mt samples; and the volume, density, and molecular weight of the heptanes and heavier fractions are determined in order that the analyses can be reported in terms of mole percentages. A mercury piston is used to compress the gas from separator to the desired reservoir pressure. To this end the gas-sample containers (Fig. 1-A) are connected into a manifold which communicates by a suitable arrangement of valves with the 1,500-ml. cylinders (Fig. 1-B and C; and Fig. 2) which are heated electrically and controlled to within plus or minus 0.2 deg. F. at reservoir temperature. The gas is allowed to fill these cylinders, and the experimental recombination bomb (Fig. 1-B; and Fig. 3) likewise is controlled at the desired temperature. The mercury piston used to compress the gas operates in cylinder (Fig. 1-B; and Fig. 2). For pressure of more than 2,000 lb. per sq. in. the mercury pump (Fig. 1-F) is used to inject mercury into the bottom of cylinders (Fig. 1-B and C), and thus to compress the gas into cylinder (Fig. 1-B) and into the bomb (Fig. 1-D).",,American Petroleum Institute

Dunlop(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-39-361,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"API pipe specifications at the present time are undergoing considerable change. Some of the changes are both revolutionary and evolutionary, and are of great importance to the petroleum industry. The collapse strength of casing is an important factor to be considered when selecting long casing strings, and a series of collapse curves for the several grades of API pipe having minimum tensile yield strengths, ranging between the limits of 25,000 and 80,000 lb. per sq. in., shortly will be published.? A somewhat radical change in the form of threads for casing and tubing, and in the taper of threads for casing, 7-in. outside diameter and smaller, is now in process as a result of dissatisfaction on the part of many operators with the performance under field conditions of the American Standard (Briggs) 3/8-in.-taper threads. Increased drilling depths have brought about the use of alloy steels having a higher minimum tensile yield strength than API grade D material for the manufacture of oil-well casing. This higher-strength material is to be covered by specification in API Standards No.5-A, and a complete reclassification of the grades of casing and tubing now is being considered by the pipe committee. Simplification of casing sizes and weights is a matter of great importance to the industry, and changes in the listing of API standard casing sizes, with a view to effecting a saving in the cost of this item, will be made in the near future.INTRODUCTIONIn the year 1924 the American Petroleum Institute first formulated and issued its specifications for oil-well casing, and later for drill pipe, tubing, and line pipe.&sect; These specifications served the industry quite well at the time, in that they afforded minimum standards by which oil-country tubular material could be compared, and provided a uniformity of standard sizes and an interchangeability of pipe-regardless of the make with resulting economies to both the user and manufacturer. API tubular material, as we all know, became and is now the standard for the oil industry throughout the world. To formulate standards having as broad a scope as those adopted by the American Petroleum Institute, for all classes of oil-country pipe, quite naturally required the expenditure of an immense amount of time and painstaking work on the part of those actively cooperating with the Institute, and who attended its committee meetings in an endeavor to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the Institute's work on the standardization of oil-field material. To keep abreast of the rapidly-changing conditions in the production and pipeline divisions of the industry, it has been necessary to revise and make amendments to the pipe specifications from time to time-a large number of the changes being brought about as a result of the knowledge and experience gained in the use of pipe in the field and the introduction of new manufacturing processes and materials. These changes are not made overnight, so to speak, but are the outcome of very careful study on the part of the main pipe committee and its subcommittees which, in the main, are composed of engineers and representatives of operators and manufacturers.",,American Petroleum Institute

Main(Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co.),,,,,,API-39-421,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"This is a new approach, from a theoretical standpoint, to the problem of collapsing pressures of oil-country tubular goods. The paper points out the limitations of present formulas, and suggests a method whereby the two existing types of rational formulas might be combined to give a result which is also rational and will apply throughout the entire range of tube proportions regularly used for casing, drill pipe, and tubing. Although the equation which is developed by this method is cumbersome, it should aid in clearing up some of the mistaken notions on this problem, and help to straighten out the controversy on safe setting depths of oil-country tubular goods from a collapsing point of view.INTRODUCTIONThe author points out the obvious limitations of:So-called elastic formulas similar to the one of Timoshenko :(mathematical equation available in full paper)Hoop-stress formulas such as Barlow's:(mathematical equation available in full paper)Empirical solutions such as Johnson's parabolas, the Mannesmannrohren Werke formula, etc.,(mathematical equation available in full paper)And, using the derivations of Bresse for bending stresses modified to fit the maximum-strain energy theory, together with the maximum-strain energy equation for hoop stress, he sets up the above equation. Even though cumbersome, this equation should aid in clearing up some of the mistaken notions on the collapse problem of oil-well casing, and should aid in obtaining the safe setting depths for oil-country tubular goods. In order to obtain a general picture of the problem of collapsing pressures, it is necessary to review briefly some of the previous efforts at a solution.Bending-Stress FormulasThe equations shown in Fig. 1-which erroneously, in the writer's opinion, have become accepted too generally-are based on the collapsing action of external pressures on thin, and usually short, hollow cylinders; and all take the form very ably illustrated in Mr. Clinedinst's paper.1aYou may call these thin-tube formulas, if you wish; but for the purpose of this discussion, we shall refer to them as bending-stress formulas. This name is based on the method of their derivation, and they apply where the bending stress is the predominating influence in collapse. The term elastic or envelope curve is misleading, and should be avoided. Shorn of those terms relating to the number of lobes into which the tube collapses and to the end effects of short cylinders, these equations are:(mathematical equation available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute
277,320837,,Joint and Collapse Strength of API Grades H40 and J-55 Electrically-welded Casing,T.J. Crawford(Republic Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-39-432,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The author presents data on tensile tests of 147 joints of API grades H-40 and J-55 electrically-welded casing, ranging in size from 4 1/2- to 13 3/8in. outside diameter. Round and sharp threads, as well as short and long threads, and couplings are compared. Results are correlated with those from similar tests on seamless casing presented at the 1938 annual meeting.? The author demonstrates that joint strength is substantially a function of yield strength in tension of the material; and is generally independent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material. A method is suggested-and carried through-for deriving probable minimum values for joint strength of both grades. Data also are presented covering collapse tests upon 202 specimens of grades H-40 and J-55 electrically welded casing. It is demonstrated that there can be expected, from this class of casing, collapse strength at least as great as that predicted from published curve formulas for seamless casing having material of equivalent yield strength in tension. The principal purpose of this paper is to present evidence showing that yield strength of the material in tension, as determined by the current API specification, has a significant influence on joint strength and collapse strength of API casing; to correlate and compare test results on electrically-welded casing with those obtained by tests on casing manufactured by other methods; and to present a statistical method for determining minimum values for joint strength of standard API casing. Incidental to these main objects, comparisons between the joint strength of round threads and API sharp threads, as well as between that of long couplings and short couplings, are developed on certain sizes.TEST PROCEDUREThe Selection of TestsIn order to develop a comprehensive analysis of joint strength of various sizes and gages of both grades, H-40 and J-55, a test program was followed as shown in Table 1. This covers the range in outside diameter from 4 1/2 in. to 13 3/8in., and includes all popular sizes-in all, 147 pullout tests were involved. As 7-in. outside diameter is the most popular casing size in use today, most of the testing was done on that size. Comparative tests were run throughout on this size, using sharp thread and round thread. Tests using long couplings were included also on the heavier weights of the J -55 grade. In order to develop a true comparison of the thread forms, both of these tests were cut from the same joint of pipe (as shown in Fig. 1), and nipples from the opposite ends of the length of pipe were used in making up each test joint. In this way it is believed that the effect of variations in physical properties along the length substantially was eliminated. This duplicate test procedure also was used on the 5 1/2in. 17-lb. to compare sharp and round threads, and on the 6 5/8-in. 26-lb. J-55 grade to compare short and long couplings. When two test joints were cut from a single length of pipe, a collapse test specimen was cut from the center portion of the pipe, and the physical results of each type obtained from the two groups of tension and compression specimens were averaged to obtain the physical properties applying to the collapse test.",,American Petroleum Institute
278,320838,,Discussion on the Effect of Combined Longitudinal Loading and External Pressure on the Strength of Oil-Well Casing,S.H. Edwards(Standard Oil Co. of California)|C.P. Miller(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-39-483,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"Collapse tests on tubes simultaneously loaded under external pressure and longitudinal tension simulating oil-well casing in service are described and reported herein. The results show that the effect of the combined loading substantially reduces both the collapse resistance and tensile yield strength of tubes; and indicates that if the diameter-thickness ratio, simple yield strength, and simple collapse strength of casing are known, its behavior under oil-well loads can be predicted throughout the depth of the well. More than 200 tests were made on 2-in. seamless-steel tubes-with various combinations of loads ranging from straight collapse pressures to straight tensile forces, with ratios of tube diameter to tube-wall thickness ranging from 11 to 22, and with steels of yield strengths from 30,000 to 80,000 lb. per sq. in. An illustration of the application of the test results to an actual casing failure is included.FOREWORDThe resistance to collapse of oil-well casing is becoming increasingly important as deeper and deeper wells are being drilled. In order properly to select and design casing for such wells, therefore, it is essential to be able to evaluate the significance of any factors that affect collapse strength. Among the various factors which affect the collapse strength of casing, the yield strength of the steel is found to play an important role.4aIn general, the resistance to collapse is increased when the yield strength is raised, and decreased when it is lowered. According to the theories of the strength of materials, the imposition of combined (biaxial) loads of unlike sign-tension and compression at right angles to each other-lowers the yield strength.1,2,3As casing, due to the weight of the string and external pressure, may be subject to combined loading of this character, it can be expected that, under such circumstances, its yield strength and, consequently, its resistance to collapse will be reduced. In other words, under the combined loading, the effect is the same as if the casing was of originally lower-strength material. Similarly, the combined loading will reduce the longitudinal yield strength in tension. The practical significance of this reduction is not as apparent as in the case of collapse, but it may be responsible for certain cases of joint leakage. Although it can be predicted that combination loading will affect the strength of casing, as described previously, the actual extent of its influence can only be established empirically. The literature fails to disclose any tests on tubular goods under the combination of loading which casing undergoes, the nearest approach being the work of A. J. Becker.1His tests were made, however, under exactly opposite conditions-longitudinal compression and internal pressure-and, consequently, were not strictly applicable to casing. Moreover, they included only one grade of low-strength tubing. As is to be expected, they showed that combination loading reduced the yield strength, and that, as the ratio of one load to the other increased, the loss of strength was quite appreciable. It was reasonable to believe that casing would behave in a similar manner. It was also possible that, under extreme conditions, the yield strength might be reduced so much that the customary factors of safety would cease to furnish protection.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hammer(Security Engineering Co. lnc.),,,,,,API-39-503,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"Mechanical limitations sometimes are the important factors which determine production methods. Drillable materials permit well-completion technique to be varied widely to meet certain present or future production requirements. The nature of sub-surface oil-well work necessitates the use of materials sufficiently strong to satisfy handling and service requirements, to withstand erosive action of fluids, and to resist corrosion. Furthermore, the material must be readily drillable, possess a low specific gravity, and form bit cuttings which can be circulated from the well.INTRODUCTIONOil-well-completion technique varies in many producing localities in accordance with the exact requirements of the particular productive strata. However, in any well, mechanical limitations sometimes are the prime factors which determine the production methods to be used. Increased flexibility of well-completion technique, therefore, would be an aid in permitting these methods to be varied to meet specific present or unforeseen future production requirements. A step towards this desired increased flexibility has been found in the adaptation of the properties of a certain alloy which possesses ample strength for sub-surface use, but has the distinction of being readily drillable-thus allowing removal from the well by means of a drilling bit. This material is available in the various pipe and tubing sizes, as well as in the form of heavy wall extrusions, forgings, bar stock, and castings. The characteristic of drillability, in combination with the various forms of fabrication, allows devices to be used with a certainty that the metal can be removed at any time desired; and those sections of the well where drillable materials exist can be returned to their original state without loss of hole or pipe diameters.MECHANICAL PROPERTIESA drillable metal should possess certain properties for underground oil-well production installations: viz., 1, be sufficiently strong to satisfy normal handling and service requirements; 2, be able to withstand erosive action of certain types of sand-laden fluids; and, 3, be able comparatively to resist attack of corrosive substances. In addition to these, the material should have a low specific gravity and form small chip like cuttings when drilled, so that the bit cuttings can be carried from the well by the return circulation fluid. The minimum mechanical and physical properties of a widely-used drillable metal are as follows:(available in full paper)The application of drillable metal to production work varies with the particular field or well problem, and the methods and procedures discussed herein can be expanded or modified for adaptation to specific requirements.SPECIFIC USESThe most widely-used applications are for regular production liners or screens which are perforated, run, and set in any conventional manner. Adapters, liner hangers, packers, and other fittings are made of drillable materials, so that the entire assembly is subject to removal with a drilling bit. Many of these installations consist of placing the largest-diameter liner possible through the same size casing, as washover space is not required and the benefits of larger screening areas are obtained. These regular production liners sometimes are modified to combine drillable pipe with steel pipe, to form a production string with removable sections positioned at certain predetermined locations where it is desired to clear the area of pipe whenever necessary.",,American Petroleum Institute

Bruce(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-39-511,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The mathematical formula which describes the cooling of a circumferential casing weld is compared with temperature measurements made on about 50 field-type casing welds. This comparison indicates that the formula may be used freely to determine the temperatures and the time rate of change of temperatures in or near cooling welds. The numerical evaluation of this formula is described, and the use of approximate formulas is indicated. Curves are given showing the trends of the cooling of the casing when variables of welding, such as number of welders, arc current, pounds of metal per inch of weld, and per cent of the total time spent welding the last bead, are calculated. The experimental data indicate that the use of the formula well may be more accurate for determining temperatures than any set of teats in which these temperatures were measured. It is shown that a deviation from the mean temperature at any time for any particular temperature measurement is most probably 5.7 per cent.INTRODUCTIONEngineers who are interested in circumferential casing welding have known for some time that the exact knowledge of the temperature distribution and of the cooling rates is necessary for a metallurgical understanding of this type of weld. At first it appears that the most direct method of getting this thermal information is to weld some pipe and to measure the temperatures. This presents two difficulties, as follows: 1. There is an infinite number of sets of conditions in field welds. 2. For each set of conditions the variations of the behavior of an individual welder, his machine, and the thickness of the casing are such that a number of similar tests would have to be made to obtain the average behavior of a weld made for a given set of conditions. The alternative is to use the heat theory to develop an equation which would express the temperature at any place in the casing at any time. In this work such a general equation for the flow of heat was developed. This equation was given a thorough test for its ability to predict the temperatures in a number of common field-type welds. The equation then was used to give the temperature for cases other than those tested.Use of the Heat TheoryThe development of an equation describing the cooling of a circumferential weld has been given previously.1aThe following is a very brief outline of this development. We start with the fundamental-heat equation,2,3which is:(mathematical equation available in full paper)(Zero of the coordinate system is the point where any welder finishes.)

Winkler,,,,,,API-39-521,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The author presents dilatometric data for several steels considered for oil-well casing and for many familiar alloy steels. These data are presented graphically, showing the instantaneous length of a 4-in. specimen, on heating and cooling, as a function of temperature. Inasmuch as the length of a steel changes as it undergoes transformation, temperatures of transformation are indicated by non-uniformities in the curves, from which some indication can be obtained of the relative magnitude of volume change on cooling. The curves show that for steels of equivalent hardness, when properly heat-treated, the transformations on cooling may take place at greatly different temperatures. In general, it can be assumed that the lower the temperature of transformation on cooling, the greater will be the tendency toward tenderness on cooling from a welding temperature; and if tubing is to be welded in the field, it may be desirable to consider the dilatometric curves of the steel to be welded if safe welds are to be produced. Supplemental information on grain size and coarsening temperatures is included.It is not unusual in the course of new developments to encounter difficulties in the application of new steels and new methods. In the transition from wrought iron to steel, the first forgings were condemned as inferior; steel axles instead of being stronger than those of wrought iron were actually weaker. New lessons had to be learned about the forging of ferrous materials, and soon the art of heat treatment was developed. The introduction of alloying elements into steel composition has extended greatly the usefulness of steel, but in the course of these developments there have been instances of serious difficulty and disappointment. As a result of experience and study, steel producers and steel consumers, by virtue of better understanding of the fundamental character of materials, have developed means for processing and control which either have overcome these difficulties or, as a result of that experience and study, have established proper limitations as to the application of specific types of steel. Certain alloy steels exhibited properties which caused them to be classed as tender steels. Quite naturally this characteristic is most pronounced while the metal is in the as-cast condition, or when the structure is such that the primary crystallization has not been broken up entirely by mechanical hot work and heat treatment; in other words, when the steel does not have the best structural constitution to resist the volumetric changes generated in cooling through the thermal critical range. The dilatometer has been useful in the study of these steels. This type of testing not only establishes the critical-temperature ranges, but also provides some insight into the relative extent of dimensional changes and stresses which may be induced during heating and cooling cycles. The practice of field welding of casing is a relatively new undertaking. It is not surprising that conditions have been encountered and certain difficulties experienced which perhaps were not anticipated fully. In this symposium on the field welding of casing, the author was assigned the work of developing dilatometer critical-temperature data for specimens cut from oilwell casing of several grades.",,American Petroleum Institute

Smith Corp.),,,,,,API-39-530,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The author gives metallurgical principles relating to the welding of caring steels, with particular reference to the influence of such factors as the composition of the steel, the hardening characteristics of the heat affected zone, and the rate of cooling from the critical range. Critical data as shown are confined mainly to higher-carbon steels.Welding casing in the well, the desired quality of the steel is that it will be strong and yet can be welded and then dropped quickly into the mud of the well without hardening or cracking. No special difficulties are encountered in arc welding the mild steels. The carbon and manganese contents of such steels are so low that the heat effect of welding, even though it be relatively severe for a welding operation, exerts but a moderate effect on the parent stock. As the carbon and manganese contents are increased to secure greater strength, the situation becomes more acute, and Hodell actually has shown for casing steel that certain grades present a serious problem of weldability. In general, when the hardening elements-carbon, manganese, molybdenum, etc.-exceed certain values, one is confronted in the arc welding of casing strings with either a hard, brittle joint or a delay in dropping the joint into the mud. An attempt to improve the weldability by preheating the stock would consume considerable time. At the same time the work of Hodell and Bruce on the actual rate of cooling of arc-welded casing joints shows that the cooling velocity of the heat-affected zone varies over an appreciable range. This introduces a second and equally important element in arc welding casing. Whereas one steel may weld satisfactorily with one technique, with another technique the same steel may produce a brittle weld. This gives us the dual problem of determining correct operating conditions for welding casing strings and selecting steels which can be welded properly under conditions which can be established in practice. The present paper will be devoted to an analysis of the fundamental metallurgical elements of the problem of weldability in an attempt to point out the parts played by the composition of the casing steel, the hardening characteristics of the heat-affected zone, and the rate of cooling from above the critical range. Although, for reasons which will be set forth later, the complete analysis cannot be given at present, it becomes perfectly clear that the use of strengthening elements alone for producing high strength in casing steel may defeat the very purpose of arc welding casing strings. It becomes equally clear that the strengthening elements must be held below the limits which provide weldability, and that any additional strength required must be secured by other means. Without attempting to discuss the ultimate reasons for hardening, we may say that steels reach room temperature in a soft condition when they cool a t a slow rate from above the critical temperature. Under these circumstances the transformation from austenite to pearlite occurs, and a t a temperature which is closely that given on the iron-carbon diagram for Ari.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hoyt are correlated, and additional experimental evidence is shown to demonstrate the effect of various subcritical cooling velocities on the hardness of medium-carbon steels. As a result of the information furnished in this and the other three papers just mentioned, it is possible to compute, mathematically, suitable welding techniques. This has been done for a number of varying sets of welding techniques over a wide range of casing sizes. The effect of the change in each of the several variables on the resulting temperature and cooling velocities has been shown by examples. It is concluded that, by proper choice of the chemicals in the casing that is to be welded and of the electrodes which are to be used in the welding, a wide range of oil-well casing can be welded successfully under field conditions by following welding techniques that are compatible with field requirements.I. Objective is to look more closely into the fundamentals involved in welding casing:The practice of welding oil-well casing in the hole in lieu of the use of thread and coupled joints has met with a variety of results, some adverse and some quite favorable. On the one hand there have been several million feet of casing successfully welded in the hole and, on the other, there have been serious failures in the welds. In a casing failure, the usual tendency is to blame the welders for inexpert work. The presumption is made in the present study, however, that competent welding can be obtained, and that the fundamentals involved must be studied more closely in order properly to diagnose the problem.II. American Welding Society sets No. 200 Brinell as limiting hardness of weld that is not to receive special treatment :The American Welding Society has set at 200 Brinell (which is the equivalent of 15 Rockwell C and 95 Rockwell B ) the hardness of the completed weld which may be regarded as acceptable without annealing, preheating, or other treatment.III. Our problem is to produce a weld which has a hardness within this limitation :Inasmuch as a weld which shows greater hardness is considered to be sufficiently brittle to be unreliable unless especially treated, and inasmuch as the exigencies of the practice of field welding of casing are such that there is no time for special treatment, the casing welder's problem is to produce a weld at least close to these limits without special treatment.IV. Hardness studies and tensile and bend tests of medium-carbon casing steels show that acceptable welds can be made in these steels:Rockwell Hardness B Scale on Weld Area. FIG. 1(available in full paper)Fig. 1 shows Rockwell hardness studies of welds which have been made in medium-carbon steel (carbon, 0.22 per cent; manganese, 1.13 per cent; copper, 1.05 per cent). These welds have been allowed to cool in air. As will be seen from examination of the hardness distribution, there is no evidence that, when such welds are made, they will develop air-hardening beyond the acceptable limits.",,American Petroleum Institute

Robinson(The Texas Co.),,,,,,API-39-567,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"This paper presents a compilation of test methods being used to evaluate cement for use in oil wells. These special procedures have been developed within the oil industry, because standard test methods are not applicable. The special methods are given in detail-with purpose, procedure, interpretation, and practical application of test data. Results of tests covering several cements used in oil wells are shown. There is a definite need for standardization of methods for testing cements used in oil wells, and it is proposed that an American Petroleum Institute code be formulated.INTRODUCTIONThe placement of cement in oil wells presents problems for both oil operator and cement manufacturer. Particularly in the case of deep drilling the need for special cements has resulted in the development of new test methods for evaluative purposes. Although these tests have contributed to the solution of cementing problems, their development and application have not been coordinated. Consequently, considerable confusion exists as to acceptable methods and apparatus for carrying on such work. This paper presents a compilation of methods for making special tests on oil-well cements, and provides specific information as to the practical interpretation and application of results. The use of cement in oil wells differs from its normal use in making concrete in that: 1, cement for oil wells is used as a neat slurry; 2, the slurry must be capable of being pumped for a considerable distance over a period of time; and, 3, the temperature of the slurry increases during placement. Because of these differences the standard ASTM testing methods, which were designed to evaluate portland cements suitable for concrete, do not provide the desired information concerning the suitability of cement for use under oil-well conditions. Although some of the special testing methods have been described previously,1a,2,3it is believed that a compilation of these methods of testing cement for use in oil wells will serve a useful purpose. An attempt has been made to present the procedures in a uniform style, and in this connection the liberty has been taken of re-arranging and paraphrasing the written procedures of various companies.Cement Sampler. FIG. 1(available in full paper)SAMPLINGIt is necessary to secure a representative sample of the cement in order to obtain reliable test results. This may be accomplished by means of a tube sampler, as shown in Fig. 1, and a wide-mouth air-tight container, such as a 1-gal. friction-top pail. A typical sampling procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2 through Fig. 5.SIEVE TESTPurposeThis test is used to detect lumps, unground or foreign material; and to provide a clean sample for further testing.ApparatusAn ordinary 30-mesh screen, 8 in. diameter, should be used.ProcedureSomewhat more than 2,000 grams of dry cement should be screened.Interpretation of ResultsSubstantially all of the sample should pass through the 30-mesh screen.

285,320845,,Oil and the Bearing,R.J.S. Pigott(Gulf Research and Development Co.)|Paul G. Exline(Gulf Research and Development Co.),,,,,,API-39-592,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The authors present reasons why oil or grease is used for lubrication under various conditions. A full bearing is discussed; and its positions with respect to the journal when at rest and in motion, both when dry and lubricated, are illustrated. Thick-film, boundary, and plastic lubrication are defined. Lubrication of plane sliding surfaces and deviations from theory occurring in actual bearings are discussed. Comparison is made between plain and grooved bearings as to load capacity and use. Lubrication and heat transfer are discussed, as are materials used for bearings. Bearings which are lubricated by grease rather than oil are discussed briefly, as are ball and roller bearings.INTRODUCTIONDuring the past 60 years the practice of lubrication has made great strides toward passing from an art to something approaching an exact science. In spite of the enormous amount of theoretical work which has been done, it does not yet enable a designer to state precisely which oil and which bearing will fit a given set of conditions, without referring to his experience or to the experience of others. The hundreds of articles which have been published describing theoretical and experimental work on bearings and lubrication not only make it extremely difficult for an engineer to locate information desired in the solution of a given problem, but still leave the need for simple presentations of what actually happens in a bearing, and why. It is the aim of this paper to present a concept of sleeve-bearing operation, with a view to showing that-in spite of the extraordinarily-simple mechanical construction of a bearing-its behavior actually is extremely complex; and that the assumption that the structural simplicity applies also to the behavior of the bearing has resulted in endless errors of design and operation. As far as running conditions are concerned, most bearings could be run on any liquid that has sufficient viscosity for the purpose; in fact, bearings actually have been lubricated with air, water, and syrups. The reason oil is used universally, however, for the lubrication of bearings is that it is the only material which has a high resistance to change of character under the operating conditions, is non-corrosive in general, but cheap enough to use.Sleeve-Bearing FrictionA full bearing-one which completely surrounds the journal-necessarily must be larger in diameter than the journal which runs in it. With the journal at rest it will take the position shown in Fig. 1, whether a lubricant is present or not. A vertical line drawn through the centers of both journal and bearing will intersect their common point of contact. Clockwise rotation of the dry journal will cause a counter-clockwise rotation of the line of centers as the journal rolls up the side of the bearing, until slippage occurs (see Fig. 2). If the clearance space is filled with a viscous liquid, a surprising difference of behavior occurs. As soon as the journal begins to slip, the line of centers rotates with the journal-until the point of nearest approach to the bearing is 180 deg. from the line of load application (see Fig. 3).",,American Petroleum Institute
286,320846,,Load Rating for Roller Bearings,C.R. Athy(International Stacey Corp.),,,,,,API-39-600,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The paper recommends and discusses a formula for the load rating of roller bearing-a formula which the author feels is needed; because, as is pointed out, no universally-accepted formula as yet has been adopted. By this formula the ratings are based entirely on the physical dimensions of the bearings. Various factors in the formula are discussed, and tables giving speed and life conversion factors are included. The derivation of the formula is given in detail. It is recommended that this formula be adopted as a tentative API standard, and that a series of endurance tests on all makes of roller bearings be conducted by a neutral institution to establish the true value of the quality factor as used in the formula.In the past 10 or 15 years there have been important developments in the design of equipment for the drilling and pumping of oil wells. The petroleum industry has passed quickly from the hand-made rigs of the preceding era to the highly-engineered precision-built machines of today. Rapid evolution has occurred particularly in the improvement of bearings. In the original standard rig, bearings were made of wood. As drilling depths increased, the wood bearings were replaced gradually with babbitted or bronze bearings. In recent years wells have been drilled to such tremendous depths that plain bearings are no longer adequate. Consequently, anti-friction roller bearings have come into common usage in all types of drilling and pumping machines. The choice of proper roller bearings is something of a problem, because up to the present time no uniform method of evaluating the load-carrying capacity of anti-friction bearings has been adopted. Bearings of given sizes are listed with widely-different capacity ratings by the various manufacturers. Several investigators and national associations have attempted to eliminate this confusion by suggesting formulas for the rating of roller bearings. Many commendable contributions have been offered, but no formula as yet has been accepted universally. The Manufacturers' Subcommittee, of the Institute's Committee on the Standardization of Standard Rigs and Derricks, has been assigned the problem of recommending a formula for the rating of roller bearings to be used by the members of the Institute until a more acceptable formula is available. In carrying out this assignment, the views of the various bearing manufacturers have been studied, and the literature on the subject reviewed-with the result that the committee has proposed the following formulas for standard radial load rating of cylindrical and tapered roller bearings :(mathematical equation available in full paper)DISCUSSION OF FORMULASRadial Load Rating PCand PtLoad rating PCis intended to apply to conventional roller bearing only. No attempt has been made to rate needle or quill bearings. The load rating Pt represents only the radial load capacity of tapered roller bearings, and not the thrust load capacity. Load capacities of spherical roller bearings as yet have not been considered.Quality Factor KThe factor K includes all manufacturing variables-material, heat treatment, dimensional accuracy, finish, design, etc., as well as all intermediate constants encountered in the derivation of the formulas.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-39-620,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The successful protection of steel with organic coatings requires careful attention to four factors: 1, selection of material; 2, surface preparation; 3, correct application; and, 4, adequate film thickness. Failure to take proper precautions with any one of these four factors can cause early failure. To select the proper material it is necessary to set down the various properties which are required, and weight them according to their relative importance. Against these importance weighting5 can be set the ratings of the materials under consideration for each of the properties. In this way the relative value of coating materials for specific uses can be calculated. Proper surface preparation involves primarily the removal from the steel, before painting, of all interfering material which may impair the adhesion of the paint. Poorly-bonded mill scale and rust are the two most common causes of trouble. To get good protective value, the paint must be applied uniformly so as to wet the surface thoroughly, and enough paint must be used to give a thickness whose impermeability is well above the critical value at which corrosion begins.The man responsible for painting the properties and equipment of an oil company today faces an extremely difficult and important problem. The importance of his responsibility has increased greatly due to the increased value of the structures and equipment for which he is responsible, and because constantly-tightening competition makes the appearance of his company's properties a more and more important factor in getting and keeping business. His problem has become increasingly difficult; because protective coatings now are forced to meet much more divergent requirements due to the changes in plant design, and due to rapidly-changing building methods. His job frequently is disappointing; because, using the same materials and methods, he may get good results in one case, and dismal failure in another. Fortunately, this increase in the difficulty of paint maintenance has been paralleled by radical improvements in the properties of paint materials, achieved by the introduction of new materials. However, the very number of these new products has presented the paint user with a more difficult problem of selection. As a research chemist, I must insist that these new materials with their better properties-although they make the paint-user's problem more complex-have not made it more difficult if an intelligent approach is made to the proper selection and use of material. Unfortunately, too many paint users have allowed themselves to be overwhelmed by the complexity of this problem and, as a result, have approached the selection and use of materials in haphazard fashion-with the result that improper materials are selected, and good materials give disappointing results because of improper application. Although the problem of selecting and using protective coatings is complex, it is subject--like most engineering- problems-to analysis and solution by the application of certain rather simple concepts and principles. This paper will outline some of these principles, and will suggest how they may be applied to what might be called an engineering approach to the problem of selecting and using protective coatings.",,American Petroleum Institute

Knowlton(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-39-630,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"The author outlines briefly the background and history of unitization, placing emphasis on Henry L. Doherty as one of its early advocates. Outstanding examples of successful operation of unitized projects in Oklahoma and other states are cited, together with production figures for some of the fields. Objections to and advantages of unitization are discussed-the author stating that the advantages dwarf the objections. The author states that the oil industry, in order to make a reasonable profit, must drill fewer wells on wider spacing, and substitute for this saving of wells a more efficient use of reservoir energy; and that this can be accomplished best by unit operation or blocked acreage.INTRODUCTION Unitization is a word that is being re-introduced to the oil business. I am indeed happy to have the opportunity to discuss this topic, as I believe it is so important to the industry at this time due to the acute economic conditions we now are facing. The subject of unitization is too broad to be covered in a single paper to be read or discussed in the time allotted to me. It is my feeling that some particular phase of unitization should be selected, and this selected phase developed and expanded in a thorough manner, rather than to give a sketchy treatment of the entire subject. An investigation of literature available on the subject of unitization-the chief sources of which are publications of the American Petroleum Institute and the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, and the leading trade journals--discloses that almost all of the papers or articles on this subject could be listed under one of the following four classifications :LegalTechnicalEconomicThose dealing with specific examples of unitization, i. e., devoted to describing the results obtained from unit operation in some particular pool.I believe the topic has been covered so well that it is largely a matter of stressing the necessity of unitization in order to meet our present economic problems. The great majority is convinced that unit operation is legally, economically, and technically sound. Action and results are needed. Although very interesting material, a detailed history of unitization would show only the inception and development of the unitization idea and practices from the early days of the industry to the present, and the historical trend in this regard, but would not evaluate its present position and importance in other than a broad manner. From a contemporary, realistic viewpoint, the real need today is for the promotion or selling of the idea of unitization, with the admitted aim of making the entire industry unit-conscious. No doubt it is unnecessary for me to spend any time reciting to you the benefits and advantages of unitization, but I do want to urge you to make the most of every opportunity that presents itself to sell others not only in your own organization, but others with whom you have business relationships as well, on the desirability of unit operations.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hall(First National Bank),,,,,,API-39-635,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"This paper presents an outline of the various factors which should be given all possible consideration in an appraisal of oil properties. Changed development and production methods, and regulatory control of production in the last few years, have brought many new factors into appraisal estimates and made necessary the reweighting of the old factors. Of particular importance is the relative weighting of all factors for properties in prorated areas, where past performance may have no direct bearing upon future expectancy. Special attention is directed to the numerous items which enter into the control of revenue and costs, as the worth of a property logically can be based only upon its net earning power. Suggested forms are outlined for data compilation to meet the usual purposes of appraisals. These are considered particularly valuable as an aid in fixing property prices and terms because of the present-day relatively-low rate of investment returnThis paper is an attempt to enumerate, and discuss the reasons for, the various factors which enter into an appraisal of oil properties. The discussion is confined to properties productive of what commonly is known as crude oil. If the primary production of a property is gas and condensates, its appraisal is another problem, and is a subject for separate discussion.BASIS OF AN APPRAISALThe logical basis on which to appraise a revenue producing asset is an appraisal of its net revenue throughout its economic life-net revenue being defined as the gross revenue less the total cost of producing that revenue. Any acreage which can be considered oil-productive can be appraised on this basis.FUNDAMENTAL FACTORSThe fundamental major factors in a complete appraisal, on the basis defined, are:Gross revenue or earnings, determined by:Recoverable oil, reduced to marketing conditions.Unit or market price of oil.Cost of oil produced and marketed, consisting of:Investment cost of leaseholds, development, and facilities.Lifting or direct operating cost.Taxes and assessments levied on production, operation, and reserves.Interest, overhead, general, and any other miscellaneous expense in producing the gross revenue.Net earnings, discounted for deferment. The discounted net-earnings total is the present worth of the properties. Some appraisals end with the present worth, but a complete appraisal will include a final factor or section, which is:Use made of the present worth. Following is a discussion of the above factors in the order listed:I-a. Recoverable Oil, Reduced to Marketing ConditionsThis factor is the most difficult of determination and, consequently, subject to the greatest error-particularly if the properties under consideration are in a pool which has been under proration. Appraisals may deal with properties at any stage of development or depletion, and various methods for estimating future production are used. For a fully-developed property which has had unrestricted production for several years, a projection of the past-production-decline curve to the economic production limit is the best method.",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper proposes a method of making such predictions for cases in which a fractionation analysis of the gas is available. The method is tested by application to several cases for which both composition and volumetric behavior have been determined experimentally.INTRODUCTIONThe prediction of the volumetric behavior of complex hydrocarbon gases is of value in many industrial calculations. A number of attempts have been made to predict such behavior for both simple and complex gaseous mixtures. Beattie1aproposed the use of an equation of state in which the constants were related simply to the composition. This method was found to yield results in accord with experimental data for mixtures of nitrogen and methane.2Masson and Dolley3attempted to relate the pressure exerted by a gaseous mixture to that exerted by the components individually a t the same temperature and total volume. Gilliland4proposed a method of predicting the volumetric behavior of gaseous mixtures involving the correlation of the slopes and intercepts of the isochors of the components on a pressure-temperature diagram. This method appears to yield satisfactory results in the case wherein the components exist in the gas phase in the pure state when at the same temperature and molal volume as for the mixture. Another general method of attack proposed by Kay5involved the estimation of the pseudo-critical state for the gas in question and the subsequent estimation of its volumetric behavior from the law of corresponding states. In the present paper a somewhat different approach has been attempted. The behavior of a number of the lighter components of naturally-occurring gaseous hydrocarbons in several binary mixtures has been studied. These data afford an incomplete empirical background upon which to base a method of prediction of the behavior of complex hydrocarbon mixtures. It should be realized that at the present time there are insufficient data to permit such predictions to be made with accuracy.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSIn considering the volumetric behavior of gaseous mixtures in terms related to the behavior of their components, it is convenient to employ partial quantities? Such quantities have been proposed already for the correlation of the volumetric behavior of complex hydrocarbon mixtures in the liquid phase? The partial specific volume of any component k, as it will be employed in the present discussion, may be defined by the following equation? :(mathematical equation available in full paper)Equation (1) indicates that a partial specific volume represents the change in volume of a large quantity of a system of variable weight under isothermal, isobaric conditions due to the addition of a unit weight of the component in question. The equation stipulates by the use of the subscriptmithat the weight of all components other than component k must be maintained constant during the change in state.",,American Petroleum Institute

French(Continental Oil Co.),,,,,,API-39-653,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"Sub-surface temperatures recently have assumed increased importance in both theoretical and practical fields of applied petroleum engineering. The use of modern phase-equilibrium concepts, volumetric-reservoir relations, and thermodynamic analyses is dependent upon temperature, An aggressive study of carefully-secured earth temperatures also should advance the possibilities of geological correlation, information as to effect on seismic velocities, and movement of subterranean water. Temperature considerations are primary factors in the modem technique of Wing-mud treatment, chemical cleanout work, cement application, and location of setting cement outside of casing. Manufacturers of tools, instruments, and materials for oil-well use constantly are meeting more serious problems. Geothermal gradients are presented for most California fields, with examples of typical transient phenomena.INTRODUCTIONRecent technological developments in the oil industry have shown increasingly numerous and important applications for knowledge of oil-well temperatures under various conditions. Among problems requiring such information are those listed hereinafter: Based upon true geothermal gradients--Reservoir-content studies and space-volume relations vitally are dependent upon temperatures.Geological correlation with structure, as well as detection of faults, is sometimes possible.1aPossibilities exist for detecting or observing subterranean- water movement.Based upon transient temperatures in wells-Mud performance and stability in drilling wells are affected by heat.Chemical treatment of wells in cleaning out or plugging water sands may be affected by heat.Selection and application of cement, as well as calculation of safe drilling-out time, should be based on accurate temperature data.Design of tools, instruments, and materials for use in drilling or producing wells must recognize temperature conditions which in some instances may be critical.Thermodynamic analysis of flow-tube design and the use of phase-equilibria tables require detailed temperature observations.Temperature surveys are accepted for the location of freshly-placed cement outside casing, and in scattered instances have logged formations behind casing, have detected water sources both in open and cased hole, and have located gas- or oil-producing horizons in open hole.2As all temperatures must be obtained from a knowledge of the geothermal gradient itself or its values as modified by the particular well conditions in point, this compilation of approximate geothermal gradients has been prepared to serve until more complete and exact values are obtained.EXPLANATION OF DATAMost of the curves are based upon data contributed by various oil companies and service operators who gather some temperature data more or less incidentally. Most of the data were obtained while sub-surface-pressure tests were being made in producing or shut-in wells which may or may not have been in thermal equilibrium. Even these readings are of comparatively recent origin, and are not so widespread in application as they might be. Temperature traverses to determine the height of freshly-placed cement behind casing, occasional drilling-well surveys, and other special tests are few, and serve mainly to show conditions peculiar to the individual well as affected by recent circulation rates and periods.

Endean(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-39-659,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1939,"This paper describes a rolling-ball viscosimeter designed for measuring the viecosities of sub-surface samples of crude oil under reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature. The instrument is capable of operation over a temperature range from 80 to 200 deg. F., and a pressure range from atmospheric to 4,000 Ib. per sq. in. A method is described of transferring a sample of gas-saturated liquid from a bottom-hole sampler to the viscosimeter tube without change in its physical characteristics. The calibration is described, and a series of viscosity determinations of a lubricating .oil covering the entire pressure and temperature ranges of the instrument is given as an example of its use.INTRODUCTIONOne of the factors controlling the movement of reservoir fluid to the well bore is its viscosity. A previous Paper1ahas described an instrument and method for securing samples of sub-surface fluids which differ by a negligible amount from the reservoir fluids in place. This paper describes an instrument for measuring the viscosity of the sub-surface samples under bottom-hole conditions and a method of transferring a portion of the sub-surface sample into the viscosimeter without further change in its physical properties.Requirements of the InstrumentBefore the actual design of the viscosimeter was undertaken, a study had been made of the conditions which it had been thought necessary the instrument must fulfill. These were:The accuracy should be 3 per cent or better of the absolute value of the viscosity over the entire range of the instrument.The instrument should be capable of maintaining this accuracy over a pressure range from atmospheric to 4,000 lb. per sq. in., and a temperature range of 80 to 180 deg. F. without danger of accident to the equipment or operator.The instrument should be a self-contained portable unit which could be used with existing equipment.The construction should be such that it could be filled with a fluid sample from the present bottom-hole sampler without change in its physical characteristics.It should be primarily an instrument for rapid routine work, giving objective measurements independent of the personality of the operator.A large number of methods has been utilized for the measurement of viscosity of liquids.2The method which appeared capable of fulfilling the requirements outlined above was the rolling-ball viscosimeter. This was discussed first by Flowers,3and has been used more recently by various investigators4,5for viscosity determinations under high pressures.Schematic Diagram of Rolling-Ball Viscosimeter. FIG. 1Description of the ViscosimeterThe rolling-ball viscosimeter consists of an inclined tube filled with the liquid under examination, and through which a steel ball rolls under the action of gravity. A schematic diagram of the instrument, as it was designed to fulfill the five requirements, is shown in Fig. 1. The viscosimeter tube is a heavy-walled stainless- steel tube, capable of withstanding the maximum desired pressure, with a safety factor of at least 3. The ends are closed by steel plugs clamped against gaskets by a ring of alloy-steel cap screws through the flange on each plug.

293,320853,,The Effect of Formation Permeability on the Plastering Behavior of Mud Fluids,H.T. Byck(Shell Development Co.),,,,,,API-40-040,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"It frequently has been assumed that the loss of liquid from drilling mud increases with increased permeability of the formation penetrated. Several recent papers, which present a theoretical analysis of the filtration of muds, point out that this factor should have little or no influence upon mud plastering. The present paper presents extensive experimental data to check this important point. In order to establish the influence of this property of the formation upon water loss and sheath thickness, plastering experiments were made, with a number of representative California muds, on a high-pressure circulating filter press using a series of real and synthetic consolidated cores whose permeabilities ranged from 10 to 14,600 md.? As a result of these experiments, it is concluded that, within these limits in unfractured consolidated cores, the plastering behavior is, in fact, dependent only upon properties of the mud fluid and, hence, independent of the formation permeability.INTRODUCTIONOne of the factors which is of interest in the analysis of the plastering behavior of rotary-drilling muds and the application of laboratory data to field practice is the effect of the permeability of the formation penetrated during drilling upon liquid loss and sheath thickness. There is abundant evidence in the literature to show that under normal conditions it is the water of the mud, rather than whole mud, which penetrates the formation. However, there has been a prevalent belief that water loss increases with increased formation permeability, and that lost circulation (loss of whole mud fluid) takes place when the formation permeability reaches some indefinite high value. Circulation losses have been discussed at some length elsewhere;1aand this aspect of the problem will not be considered in this paper, which is confined to the region where filtration occurs without mud loss. It now is conceded generally that the relative plastering behavior of muds in the well is represented adequately by laboratory filtration tests made with filter paper as the filter medium-of course, with due regard to the effect of temperature; and evidence has been presented2to show that the plastering behavior of a given mud is very nearly the same when filter paper is used as the filter medium as when sintered alundum filter discs of a permeability of approximately 500 md are used. In several recent papers dealing with the plastering properties of muds from a theoretical viewpoint:3,4,5it is inferred that the rock permeability has little or no effect upon the plastering, but no experimental evidence is presented in this connection. When a single filter medium is used in evaluating the plastering properties of muds, the permeability of the mud sheath has been shown to be the most important factor in controlling the rate of water loss to the formation. The permeability of the sheath (or its reciprocal, sheath-resistance coefficient) is a function alone of characteristics of the mud-its colloid content, degree of dispersion or flocculation, solids content, particle size, etc. In order to establish experimentally the influence of formation permeability upon water loss and sheath thickness, a large number of plastering experiments were made with representative California muds on consolidated cores covering a wide range of permeabilities.",,American Petroleum Institute

Jones(Union Oil Co. of California)|Denis Berdine(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-40-045,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Factors influencing oil-well cementing failures caused by poor bonds between set cement and formation and means for improving these bonds were investigated through the use of relatively large-scale apparatus simulating conditions prevailing during the cementing of oil wells. The results-presented photographically show that, unless removed, mud cakes will remain between set cement and permeable formations. These mud cakes provide regions of weakness for the passage of water, with resulting failures of cement jobs. The results also show that objectionable mud cakes can be removed by hydraulic jelling, by the use of mechanical scratchers or scrapers, or by treatment with acid. Application of hydraulic jelling and mechanical scraping or scratching, or a combination of these operations, involves very little practical difficulty or costs.INTRODUCTIONIn oil-well cementing operations failures to obtain satisfactory results frequently are ascribed to channeling of the cement slurry, off-centered casing, and the presence of a mud cake between the set cement and the formation. In the latter case the mud cake may constitute a region of weakness that may break down or shrink, thereby providing a channel for migration of water past the cement seal. Obviously many other factors, such as cement quality, selection of stratum at which the shutoff is made, fracture of set cement during drilling, etc., may influence greatly the success or failure of cementing operations. The scope of this investigation, however, was limited largely to studies of channeling, of the effects of mud cake on the bond between cement and formation, and of the relative values of various mechanical and chemical means for removal of mud cakes.APPARATUS AND PROCEDUREThe apparatus used in conducting this investigation was designed and operated to simulate as nearly as possible conditions believed to prevail during the cementing of an oil well. Cylindrical canvas bags, reinforced externally by perforated pipe 7 in. in diameter and 15 ft long, were assembled to represent the walls of wells drilled through permeable formations. The reinforcing pipe was split longitudinally, and provided with flanges to permit its removal without disturbance of the set cement and mud cakes deposited inside the canvas bags. The reinforcement used for the first 9 tests consisted of 1/4-in. galvanized hardware cloth soldered to strap-iron frames. To obtain greater rigidity, subsequent -tests were made with the wire cloth replaced by the half sections of perforated pipe. In order to simulate alternate layers, of permeable sands and impermeable shales, this external reinforcing pipe was provided with perforated and unperforated sections as follows: bottom 3 ft unperforated, next 4 ft perforated, next 3 ft unperforated, top 5 ft perforated. It should be noted, however, that the longitudinal permeability of the canvas was found to be so great that no appreciable difference in mud-cake deposition opposite the perforated and unperforated sections could be observed. Thus the entire test well performed as though it were drilled through permeable formations.? The casing consisted of sections of 3-in. ID line pipe suspended inside the canvas bags. Four such test wells were constructed alongside a tank which served as a supporting structure.

Stephenson(University of Kansas),,,,,,API-40-064,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Because drilling by present cable-tool methods is dependent to a large extent upon a driller's judgment of tool' action transmitted to his sense of touch or his feel of the line, a mathematical analysis of the drilling system has been attempted in order to improve the efficiency of drilling. Examination of drilling-time logs by successive depth intervals or zones of 500 ft indicates that several zones are characterized by a decreased rate of penetration and an increased amount of time shut down for repairs of the drilling equipment. A comparison of the drilling action of a standard cable-tool system with an ideal elastic system shows that maximum tool motion is developed when the ratio between drilling frequency of the system is unity. Further, depth zones characterized by unsatisfactory drilling performance are shown to be zones in which the driller is most likely to use improper frequency ratios. A nomographic chart is presented which facilitates calculation of natural frequencies of cable-tool systems, and two methods of adapting these frequencies to the speed limitations of drilling machinery are proposed. Damping factors, which cause actual cable-tool systems to differ from an ideal system, are isolated, and their effects upon the frequency ratio are discussed. The effects of various degrees of hitch, one of the damping factors, are demonstrated by a dynamometer study of the cable-tool drilling motion.INTRODUCTIONThe basic principles employed in all cable-tool- or churn-drilling operations virtually have been unaltered since the Chinese first drilled shallow wells for salt water in the early days of the Christian era. However, vast improvements in rig mechanisms and labor-saving devices have been effected; the old spring pole, originally operated by the weight and brawn of three or four men, has given way to the modern all-steel rig powered with an internal-combustion engine, electric motor, or steam engine. During this period of mechanical progress the human factor has been predominant, and manual dexterity has been indispensable to successful drilling. Nevertheless, the significance of the driller's touch has been passed on from one generation to another without much explanation, because very few drillers are able to describe precisely those singularities in the behavior of the cable which are embodied in the phrase feel of the line. Each driller seems to have his own peculiar technique, although the good driller is distinguished readily from the poor one by the footage he makes in a given period of time. Even so, it is highly desirable that procedures be established on a sound engineering basis, and the judgments of the operator be replaced by technical evidence. In addition, the objective of attempts to modernize cable-tool drilling should be, in part, to aid the driller to a better grasp of fundamental principles which control the response of the string of tools to the impulses received from the drilling machinery; it should seek also to promote reliance upon engineering data, so that time can be devoted to the maintenance of equipment which otherwise is more or less neglected.",,American Petroleum Institute

The field is undersaturated and production is maintained by gas lifting while the pressure is supported by a combined water flood and limited aquifer drive.The R/B produced crude oil has an intermediate base with asphaltene content ranging from 10-15% wt and an average API Gravity 25&deg; .With the increase in water production and injected seawater breakthrough a very viscous tough emulsion was formed in some wells, causing production problems. Also, due to scale deposition, calcium carbonate and sulphate, the hydrochloric acid and other scale dissolvers were applied to clean the tubing and the formation. Some of these additives have an adverse effect on the emulsion viscosity and cause asphaltene deposition.The paper presents the study carried out to identify the problem and find a solution for it. The study includes:The rheological properties of the emulsion at different downhole conditions; shear rates, temperatures and water contents at different salinities.The effect of the different chemicals used for scale removal and inhibition on the asphaltene deposition and the produced crude oil emulsion viscosity.The effect of the flow improver products; demulsifier, Asphaltene dispersant, viscosity and drag reducers...etc. on increasing the fluidity and reducing the drop in pressure of the produced crude oil emulsion.The study results showed that the hydrochloric acid causes asphaltene deposition and tough emulsion formation. Also the increase in the water content form a very tough/viscous emulsion at a certain percentage, which is defined as the inversion point, below and above this percentage the emulsion viscosity is reasonable.The injection of the flow improver chemicals through the gas lift valves could reduce the emulsion viscosity .IntroductionSuez Oil Co., (SUCO) is one of the biggest oil producing companies in Egypt. Our field of concern Ras Budran (R/B) is operated by SUCO, located 5 Kms offshore at the eastern coast of the Gulf of Suez. The current production of R/B oil field is about 20,000-bbls/day crude oil. Ras Budran crude is asphaltic base crude oil with asphaltene contents ranged from 10-15% by weight and average API gravity of 25&deg;. The company is currently applying water injection strategy to increase the productivity of the wells. Due to the water injection and the nature of R/B crude oil, very viscous tough water-in-oil emulsion is formed in some of the producing wells and causes a significant decrease in the wells productivities.This paper summarized the work done to study the rheological properties of R/B crude oil emulsions formed downhole . The rheological properties were measured at different water/oil ratios, shear rates and at two temperatures. Emulsions inversion points were determined. Effects of the chemicals used for scale removal/inhibition and flow improvers on the emulsions behaviors were also studied.BackgroundFormation of EmulsionsAn emulsion is a mixture of two mutually immiscible liquids, one of which is dispersed as droplets in the other, and is stabilized by an emulsifying agent. The dispersed droplets are known as the internal phase. The liquid surrounding the dispersed droplets is the external or continous phase.In the oil field, oil and water are encountered as the two phases. They generally form water-in-oil emulsion, although occasionally the reverse or oil-in-water emulsion is formed. The emulsion produced is thermodynamically unstable and this is why pure water and pure oil will never form emulsion no matter how much agitation is applied.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers

The production of water in some fields is, no doubt, injurious to the oil-producing reservoir, and should be excluded to conserve reservoir energy and increase ultimate recovery. In many other fields there is no apparent damage to the reservoir by the production of water, and any remedial work done must be justified by the saving in operating cost resulting from not having to lift the water and then dispose of it. The principal factors which should be considered in determining the economics of remedial work are:Physical characteristics of the reservoir.Effect of water production on reservoir energy and ultimate recovery.Means of determining the source of water.Types of remedial work in common use.Increased operating costs due to production of water with oil.Disposal of water produced.It is important that the statistical data and information necessary to evaluate these factors be accumulated prior to the time the production of water becomes acute and a decision on remedial work must be made.The purpose of this paper is to discuss the various factors which should be considered when deciding whether it is economical to perfom1 remedial work to exclude the water from oil wells which are producing a percentage of water, and what statistical data and other information should be accumulated to evaluate these factors. The discussion will be as general as possible, as conditions will vary so much between fields, or even wells, that specific recommendations would be of little value. The decision to perform remedial work on wells producing water with the oil is not arrived a t easily if it is to be justified on a cost basis and, with the steadily declining allowable rates of production from each well, it becomes increasingly important that a satisfactory return on all major well expense or investment be assured before the work is commenced. This return may be in the form of lowered operating costs because of not having to lift the water in addition to the oil, or because of less tangible benefits such as conservation of reservoir energy and greater ultimate recovery of oil through the more efficient utilization of water encroachment. The major considerations in deciding on a program of remedial work to exclude water from oil wells discussed in this paper are:Physical characteristics of the reservoir.Effect of water production on reservoir energy and ultimate recovery.Means of determining the source of water.Types of remedial work in common use.Increased operating costs due to production of water with the oil.Disposal of the water produced.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESERVOIRThe physical characteristics of the reservoir most easily are determined, at the time the wells are being drilled, by an analysis of the cores taken from the producing horizon supplemented by electrical-log information and possibly mud analyses.",,American Petroleum Institute

The study is founded on the opinions and facts furnished by individuals and companies in reply to a questionnaire which recently was circulated to producers throughout the industry under the sponsorship of the Institute's Eastern District Topical Committee on Production Practice.INTRODUCTIONThe prevention and removal of paraffin accumulations insofar as it pertains to the production of crude petroleum will be discussed herein with the idea of bringing down to date a listing of those methods most popularly employed by the oil producers of the United States in dealing with this production problem. AS a recently completed questionnaire survey sponsored by the Institute, which received widespread response, is used as a foundation for this study, the information herein embodied should present a reliable picture of the paraffin problem, and should point out accurately the techniques most generally used for both prevention and removal of crude-was deposits. Inasmuch as the selected scope in this discussion is broad, covering general conditions throughout the industry, only those techniques recently developed or improved will be considered in any detail. Those older better-known practices still being followed merely will be recognized. It is intended that a better understanding of today's paraffin problem and its solutions, as well as the generally accepted characteristics and causes of the deposition, be brought to light in the following analysis of the survey data. Before entering into the details of the characteristics and causes of the deposit or the methods used for prevention or removal, a few general statements regarding the present status of the paraffin problem are desirable. In the first place, the severity of the paraffin accumulations found today, both in oil wells and in the surface equipment associated with them, is very nearly equal in magnitude to that experienced by operators 10 years ago. Little net progress inpreventingthe accrual of was deposits in or on producing equipment has been noted. Although considerable benefit has been derived from free-gas conservation and from steps taken to retain in crude oil more of its lighter volatile ends, this has been offset to a certain degree by the simultaneous growth of restrictive production laws and policies, which have aggravated paraffin deposition. Measurable advancement has occurred, however, along the lines ofremovingthe waxy deposits. This is best indicated by referring to the survey response to this question: In your opinion, has anything really constructive been done in the last 10 years toward simplifying the petroleum-paraffin problem in producing oil fields? Of those answering this question, 40 per cent reply m the negative.",,American Petroleum Institute

Moore(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-40-097,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Production of oil is accomplished by displacing the oil from the pores of the sand with either gas or water. In any case, some oil is left in the sand, because sands which contain only a small amount of oil do not transmit oil readily through their pores. Less oil is left in a sand from which oil has been displaced by water drive than would be left by a gas drive. In water-drive fields it is important that the production be slow enough to permit the water to flood the fine as well as the coarse sands. Gas caps should not be permitted to decrease in size due to production at excessive gas-oil ratio. Wells are important mechanical units, and must be completed properly and kept in proper repair. A number of strategically located wells is necessary to provide for adequate control of the displacement of oil by water or gas, but otherwise the number of wells drilled is of minor importance.The art of petroleum production, in some of its branches, has been developed to a high degree of perfection, principally because of the ingenuity and the skill of the petroleum engineer in applying the sciences of mechanics and metallurgy to the problems with which he has been confronted. Less progress has been made in that important phase of production dealing with the control of forces which move oil to the wells and which govern the efficiency with which oil is recovered. Slow technical development along these lines has been due to the limited knowledge of the fundamental physical laws of the movement of fluids in oil reservoirs. 'Some of the early geologists enunciated important principles which might have served as a basis for the development of sound conceptions of the mechanism of petroleum production1ahad not the technical talent within the industry devoted its efforts entirely to improvements in equipment and in the practice of drilling wells and of lifting oil to the surface. Knowledge of how oil travels from the reservoir to the wells was nearly extinguished during a dark age lasting about 30 or 40 years. The renaissance came slowly, beginning with the early work of the petroleum engineers of the Federal Bureau of Mines, and only recently has the work proceeded at a sufficiently rapid rate to indicate that the understanding of the fluid mechanics' of oil reservoirs can be applied to the practical problem of obtaining increased recovery of oil. In the last decade, particularly, intensive work on the behavior of oil reservoirs has been in progress, and a mass of data has been accumulated which has permitted, in some degree at least, the correlation of theoretical knowledge with practical experience. As a result, newer and sounder conceptions of the principles governing the performance of oil reservoirs are developing. There are still innumerable problems to be solved; but, even so, it appears desirable to review, at occasional intervals, the progress that has been made, and to indicate wherein the new knowledge gained may be applied usefully. Most of the recent work has been done on sand and sand reservoirs; and, therefore, this discussion is limited to the behavior of fluids in sand reservoirs.",,American Petroleum Institute

The interrelation of these phases of the production problem thereby is stressed. Methods of determining such factors are included only when it is considered necessary to clarify the discussion, and for this purpose only.INTRODUCTIONIn the early days of the petroleum industry, and continuing until little more than a decade ago, the engineer was concerned primarily with those problems accompanying the drilling and producing of wells and associated equipment. This limitation in scope was due not to any failure to recognize other phases of the production problem, but to conditions in the industry. The demand called for high rates of production from the then-known sources of supply. Inasmuch as the wells are the important mechanical units through which oil must be withdrawn, the wells and their associated equipment were the bottlenecks on the reservoir, and hence they-not the reservoir-were the targets for technical effort. The emphasis on rapid development and production, coupled finally with adequate reserve discoveries, led inevitably to a great surplus of wells and a potential output far in excess of current demands. Such a situation resulted, as always, in economic pressure, which forced a change in viewpoint; and thus emphasis naturally shifted from the function of wells to control of production, thence to conservation, and finally focused on the reservoir and its performance. This resume is presented not for its historical color, but to indicate why, in an industry as old as this, and almost 10 years after the urgent need arose, many engineers are still in disagreement regarding fundamentals. For only with the advent of an era of slower returns did the industry suddenly awaken to the importance of technical studies outside the realm of drilling and production technique, and practical operators to take a more serious interest in what heretofore had been looked upon more or less as academic pastimes. During the past 10 years laboratory research has not been unduly lax, but the necessary coordination of such work with actual operating technique requires time and has not been adequate to provide the maximum rate of advance. Neither laboratory study nor research in the field is alone sufficient to provide solutions to the problems which now are pressing. Experience indicates that in the future the industry must provide better coordination between so-called theoretical and practical production research. In attempting a t this time to outline concisely the factors affecting reservoir performance, and particularly to describe technique capable of determining those factors, we are handicapped by the relatively immature state of development in reservoir technology. Important basic theoretical facts are known, and idealized analyses are possible. What is needed are the qualifying factors obtainable only from experience, which will permit the application of theory to practice or, rather, which will provide assurance to all concerned that reservoir performance is determined by, and does follow, definite physical laws, the fundamentals and many details of which already are known.",,American Petroleum Institute

These data are discussed from the point of view of their application to problems of reserves estimation, well completion, control of production performance, and secondary- recovery operations.This paper is an elaboration of an answer the writer attempted to give recently to the question: What data should be taken in the development of an oil field to make possible its most effective exploitation? The question was asked by one who felt he would have some reasonable liberty in making expenditures in the gathering not only of data which would have immediate applicability, but also such data as would become useful only as the field might pass into its state of development and production decline, or even ,only after the field had become depleted completely. In other words, the future applications of the data are to be given as much weight as their immediate and present value. It is on the basis of this premise that the following considerations are presented. The answer to the foregoing question is in effect already available in petroleum-engineering literature. However, it has been given heretofore in a piecemeal fashion-i.e., in individual papers on core analysis, bottom-hole pressure measurements, etc. What will be attempted here will be a somewhat more systematic, discussion emphasizing and correlating the uses of various types of data, rather than the techniques for their empirical determination. No pretense is made that newly discovered research results are being presented. Rather, this paper largely will consist of a restatement of well accepted observations from perhaps a different point of view than usually is taken. It also may be considered as a parallel and supplementary discussion to the paper by R. D. Wyckoff on Factors Affecting Reservoir Performance, in which a number of the questions treated here are considered in a somewhat broader and more general sense.THE DETERMINATION OF OIL RESERVESThe first type of data, and in some respects the most important, which should be gathered in the development of an oil field is that providing as quantitative an estimate as possible of the original oil reserves. Although, as will be seen later, there are possibilities of indirectly determining these reserves by observing the performance of a field after it has been developed fully, the most direct method for calculating the reserves demands data which can be obtained only while the wells are being drilled. It is simply for this reason that the gathering of these data must be placed first on the list. Before entering into the detailed discussion of this question, it should be noted that throughout this paper the oil reservoir will be considered as a unit. Whereas in the case of a number of the problems discussed, as in the application of core analyses to well completion, immediate use of individual well data may be made in the handling of these particular wells, the maximum benefits will be derived even here if equivalent data are taken at a number of locations over the entire area of the field.",,American Petroleum Institute

Kemler(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-40-125,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"The advent of deep drilling has served to emphasize that the design of casing strings is an engineering problem: For this reason it is essential that minimum performance characteristics of casing be established and used, rather than the average properties. It is only by this procedure that confidence can be placed in the factors of safety computed. The test data were analyzed critically, and minimum performance properties of casing derived which are proposed for use until additional test data permit the establishment of higher permanent minimum valves. The necessity for basic revision of the API pipe specifications to meet present and future needs of the industry is pointed out. Factors to be considered in the design of casing strings for deep wells are discussed in as much detail as present knowledge warrants.FOREWORDMany improvements in methods and equipment for the drilling and production of oil wells have been effected in the last decade-perhaps more in number and greater in importance than in any similar previous period in the history of the oil industry. In part, these have been the result of normal progress; but, to a large degree, they were enforced because the industry, in the short space of a few years, found it necessary to drill wells to depths that had been visionary only a short time previously. Of the many related problems originating from the drilling of deep high-pressure wells, none has been of greater importance to the successful completion than the casing. Not only does the cost of the casing amount to an important percentage of the total cost of the well, but the operation of the well is dependent upon the successful performance of the casing. The progress in casing manufacture generally has kept pace with the other phases of drilling, and the maximum depth of drilling is not yet limited by any deficiencies in the properties of the casing. There has been, however, an evident need for more accurate data on the collapse, pullout, and bursting strengths of casing; and during the last three years many changes have been made in the API pipe specifications. Consequently, an unprecedented quantity of information- both theoretical and practical-has been accumulated and published by the American Petroleum Institute, either as technical papers or committee reports. Much of the information, particularly that pertaining to collapse strength, has involved complicated theories of advanced mechanics. Recourse to theory was necessary because sufficient test data were not available. However, as is usually the case when questions of involved theories are concerned, there has not been complete agreement as to which particular theory best applies; and it must be admitted that these prolonged arguments, in some instances, have degenerated into mere quibbling. It, is only natural, therefore, that the feeling of uncertainty which has arisen in the minds of those whose responsibility it is to select casing for deep wells has created a desire for clarification. The purposes of this paper are: 1, to summarize, collate, analyze, and evaluate the information on casing- both theoretical and actual-in an impartial manner, from the viewpoint of the user; and, 2, to point out future requirements in the way of test data and improvements in the product.",,American Petroleum Institute

McQuaid(Republic Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-40-197,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Attention is called to the many problems other than chemical specification involved in the selection of the best steel analysis for oil-production equipment. Written for the designing engineer, the metallurgical factors in the selection of steel for oil production are treated in an elementary way. The fundamental relations of carbon content, harden-ability control, hardness, and toughness are discussed also. The importance of design is stressed, with a recommendation for closer cooperation between the designing engineer, the production engineer, and the metallurgical department in the initial development of oil-production equipment.INTRODUCTIONAn attempt will be made to indicate to the designer and user of drilling and pumping equipment some of the fundamental problems involved in the selection of the most suitable steel and treatment for this service. Therefore, we shall cover, in a rather elementary way, some of the factors in steel and treatment which affect the characteristics of toughness, wear resistance, strength, machinability, etc. Due to the relatively new development of metallography and the scientific study of the metallurgy of iron and steel, some of our designing engineers are lacking in a working knowledge of this important subject. As a matter of fact, many of our metallurgical friends are lacking also in a thorough groundwork of the fundamentals of machine design, so that a common ground is sometimes absent between the designer and the metallurgist. Inasmuch as the final choice of a steel is (or should be) made on the basis of final least cost of satisfactory performance, we are interested in many considerations other than the physical properties. Such additional factors would include initial cost, processing cost, availability, and sales value. An attempt will be made to cover those factors as well as the purely metallurgical factors, and to indicate as clearly as possible the factors involved in selecting a steel for the specific application. In discussing the metallurgical requirements of a given field of application, it is usual to find that the designing engineer is convinced that his problems are more difficult of satisfactory metallurgical solution than those in other fields. The automotive engineer is limited by the requirements of high-volume-mass-production interchangeability for absolute uniformity in materials, and the constant struggle for lower production costs. The tractor and truck engineer has to meet similar requirements, with possibly more severe application conditions. Those engineers are trying to produce parts which will perform satisfactorily in a highly competitive market, without excessive field failures or expense. The designer of oil-production equipment is faced by a problem of a somewhat different nature from those encountered by the designer of equipment which is to be produced in large volume. Because of the high cost of the initial investment, the premium which successful performance gives, and the high penalty which failure of the equipment involves, the designer of equipment used in the oil industry constantly is seeking for improved performance and longer life of his equipment. There is probably no other major industry which puts such a high premium on improved performance as the oil-producing industry; and, hence, there is a constant research for steel of better quality either through analysis, method of manufacture, or treatment.",,American Petroleum Institute

Jones Co.),,,,,,API-40-209,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"This paper presents, first, a description of fatigue testing used in the determination of endurance values for sucker-rod steels. It then shows how endurance values are affected by speed of testing and by various brine analyses. A correlation then is given between actual sucker-rod field performance and laboratory endurance values made with brines from the same fields. Through this procedure it is hoped to point out the need for standardization on endurance-value tests in comparing sucker-rod materials, and also the need for modification of the tests to simulate more closely actual field conditions.INTRODUCTIONAs the sucker-rod industry has progressed, many problems have been cleared up, many irregularities straightened out, and many uncertainties defined more clearly. It is possible for the purchaser to buy sucker rods today with the assurance that the physical and chemical properties of the material will be within certain guaranteed limits. This insures a uniformity of product. Ample service records are available to show that rods with well-balanced physical properties and suitable chemical analysis will give better performance under the various pumping conditions to which they are subjected. The physical and chemical properties of the rods may be checked by the producer, if he so desires, by sending samples to independent testing laboratories. Sucker-rod service is a problem of fatigue; therefore, the all-important property of any sucker-rod material is its ability to withstand fatigue e under various conditions. In order to evaluate such properties, certain standard methods of taking endurance-value tests have been used extensively. It is the purpose of this paper to show how the procedure of taking endurance values on various materials has been modified to simulate more closely -the actual conditions to which sucker rods are subjected, and then to show how the endurance characteristic of a material, as determined in the laboratory, will correlate with load and reversal data taken from actual field records of sucker-rod failures. It is hoped that by this procedure we better may define endurance values as related to sucker-rod steel, so that a better understanding may be had of the true meaning of this yardstick for sucker-rod material. The first procedure for testing sucker-rod materials fell naturally in line with that established for steels in general. The speed tests were run in air, but these tests were found to be entirely inadequate because the sucker rods are not operating in air but, rather, in fluid conditions of various degrees of corrosivity.Corrosion FatigueIt is known quite universally that most sucker-rod failures are caused by corrosion fatigue, a subject which has been covered very adequately by papers presented before this and other groups by Wescott and Bowers,1azur Horst and Wescott,2Speller,3Speller and McCorkle,4Gough, McAdam,6and numerous other authorities.Corrosive Attack in the Form of Pit or Notch. FIG. 1(available in full paper)For the purpose of this paper, corrosion fatigue may be defined as the effect of simultaneous corrosion and repeated stressing, the mechanism of which is as follows :Corrosive attack in the form of a pit or notch (Fig. 1), sometimes microscopic in character, results in a stress concentration-the stress magnitude of which is increased greatly over the normally applied fiber stress.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc),,,,,,API-40-219,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Many dissimilar metals are in contact in oil wells. As the wells often contain a brine solution, which readily would permit a flow of current, an investigation of the galvanic effects between these metals is pertinent. For this purpose the general principles involved in galvanic corrosion have been reviewed, and the results of some galvanic tests with oil-well materials have been presented. The conclusions drawn are that in aerated brines: 1, the galvanic effects produced by coupling different grades and tempers of carbon steel with each other are negligible; 2, when carbon steels (drill pipe, casing, and tubing) are in contact with alloy steels (used for casing and tool joints) the potential differences are always in such direction as to protect the alloy steels; 3, in such galvanic couples the corrosion of the anode is controlled by the total area of the metals exposed and, 4, the lack of oxygen in most oil wells suppresses the galvanic effects.NORMAL CORROSIONThe most common form of corrosion of iron by neutral salt solutions requires the presence of oxygen. In its simplest terms the reaction may be pictured as follows:(chemical equation available in full paper)According to the electrochemical theory of corrosion, this reaction takes place in two parts: 1, at anodic regions :(chemical equation available in full paper)In neutral salt solutions well supplied with oxygen, the cathodic reaction will tend to follow equation (4); i.e., adsorbed oxygen will react with a water dipole to give hydroxyl ions. In slightly acid solutions the cathodic reaction will tend to follow equation (3) ; i.e., the electron jump will tend to be to the hydrogen ion rather than to the oxygen. In either case oxygen is required for the completion of the cathodic reaction. The rate at which the corrosion reaction proceeds will be influenced by a large number of factors-of which the oxygen supply, the temperature, composition, and relative motion of the solution, and the formation of films of corrosion product will be most important. Very often the oxygen supply is the controlling factor.GALVANIC CORROSIONThe anodic and cathodic parts of the corrosion reaction may be separated by appreciable distances. Thus when corrosion takes the form of pitting, the anodic reaction predominates in the pitted area, and the cathodic reaction on the rest of the surface. When two dissimilar metals are coupled in the same solution, the two reactions may be separated even further. The metals usually will develop a difference of potential. This will tend to confine the anodic reaction to the less-noble member of the couple, and the cathodic reaction to the more-noble member. The result will be an increased rate of corrosion of the less-noble member, and in most cases a decreased rate of corrosion of the more-noble member. A well-known example of this is the coupling of zinc and iron in salt water. Whereas the potential difference will determine which member of the couple will suffer increased corrosion, the actual magnitude of the increase will depend on the current flowing between the two metals. If no current flows, there can be no galvanic corrosion. The flow of current will be influenced by 'the factors discussed hereinafter.",,American Petroleum Institute

Roaper(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-40-231,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"The central theme of this paper is that safety is good business. Profitable operations naturally depend on efficiency of equipment and personnel. An effective accident-prevention program concentrates its attention not only on the maintenance of equipment and safe working conditions, but also on the training of employees in the efficient performance of work-realizing that the prevention of accidents and the building of morale follow as natural by-products. Several examples given by the author indicate how money savings can be effected and increased returns on investments realized, particularly through securing individual company credits on the base rates for compensation insurance as a result of improvements in accident experienceINTRODUCTIONFor many years it has been my privilege to attend a number of American Petroleum Institute meetings similar to this one. During these meetings numerous papers have been read, many speeches given, and considerable discussion held on the subject of safety. During this period we have seen organized safety work progress from an emotional approach through successive stages of physical inspections to present educational procedures. Our discussions have paralleled this development. Back of it all we have recognized, or have felt, that our safety program does have a sound business basis. However, there has not been much said formally about this particular aspect of it. It is my intention on this occasion to leave the customary avenue of approach, and to emphasize the importance of our safety program by a different route. It is not my purpose to underrate the humanitarian aspect of accident prevention, and I wish to emphasize that it is increasingly important that we follow through on some of the human approaches to the problem, such as our educational endeavors with respect to the individual worker. A genuine interest in man's welfare is a necessary part of leadership which, we must admit, is an indispensable tool in the furtherance of good industrial relations. In substance, my thesis is that safety in itself is good business, that it is an indispensable part of profitable operations, and that the satisfaction of human needs and desires is an inevitable by-product of accident prevention. We are in business to make money. Stockholders have a right to expect a reasonable return on their investment. Employees have a right to a fair return on the expenditure of their labor, and the public expects quality products at reasonable prices. It is axiomatic to say that these things can be achieved through efficiency in operations. It is not appreciated generally that a well-planned well-directed safety program can, and will, make a definite contribution to increased efficiency.Compensation-Insurance ReductionRecently all of us have become increasingly aware of the importance placed upon social legislation throughout our country. One of the earliest forms of social legislation was the workmen's-compensation law, some form of which has been adopted by practically every state in the union. Even though the state law may not compel the purchase of an insurance policy to cover this risk, it is usually good business to do so. Although industry cannot, and would not, want to reduce the benefits prescribed by these laws, it substantially can reduce insurance- premium payments by controlling the number and severity of accidents sustained by its employees.",,American Petroleum Institute

Robinson(The Texas Co.),,,,,,API-40-236,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"Without elaborating upon the details of any one type of development, this paper considers broadly the steadily growing trend in the application of chemicals to problems affecting the drilling for, and production of, oil. Chemicals for the treatment of muds, the control of heaving shales, treatments for lost circulation, special cements, the use of acid, selective water shutoffs, and the application of surface-tension reducing agents are reviewed in their relationship to the growing chemical technology, which already has been of material assistance to the driller and producer.INTRODUCTIONIn the past 10 years drilling and producing operations have uncovered problems, the solution to which cannot be obtained by wholly mechanical procedures. High sub-surface temperatures25aand their effect on drilling fluids10and cements-also hydratable shales, salt deposits, lost circulation, increase in the permeability of limestone, and a host of other obstacles-tax the resourcefulness and ingenuity of driller, engineer, and executive. In particular, deep drilling has demanded that every art and science be brought to bear, directly or indirectly, on many questions, the answers to which will assist in making the search for, and the production of, oil more scientific. In 1932 only one well in the United States20was drilled deeper than 10,000 ft ; whereas, in 1939, 215 wells exceeded 10,000 ft. It is, therefore, not surprising that chemistry and chemical engineering are being applied to certain drilling and producing problems with the intent of lending material assistance. Unfortunately for the chemist, his work involves the use of terms and procedures somewhat new to the oil field. He speaks of colloids, deflocculation, base exchange, polar molecules, pH, etc. It is only natural, then, that some should feel that chemistry may be all right for the refiner, but 1s still a bit too abstract for application to drilling and production. However, in less than 5 years strides have been made in many directions which have served to convince even the most skeptical that chemistry has come into the oil field to stay. So, with the chemist as a new member of the production department of the oil business, it may be of interest to examine broadly, in terms of the U. S. oil industry as a whole, along what lines his ingenuity is finding practical expression.Drilling MudIt is no overstatement to say that the growth in knowledge about drilling mud has been phenomenal in the past 5 years, even though a great deal remains to be learned. Since the days when a mud was spoken of as slick have come valuable insights into the nature of a mud-making material. For instance, it is now known that ultimate clay particles in mud-making clays are plate like crystallites stacked together8and that bentonite swells because water pries the plates apart to release plate like particles which have the capacity to interfere with one another and with the flow of the liquid in which they are present.8More now is known about the composition of clays and shales and the surface chemistry of clay minerals9and important factors such as the retention of water, ionization and base exchange, cohesion and gelling, and the effect of chemicals are receiving careful study.",,American Petroleum Institute

Closson(Barnsdall Oil Co.)|Herbert Wirshing(Waukesha Motor Co.),,,,,,API-40-246,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1940,"This paper is a discussion of gas-engine jacket-water cooling methods. It points out the opportunities for increased operating efficiency through thermal improvement, and stresses the idea that, through improved cooling, the engine operator may do his best maintenance work; for the condition of the cooling system is reflected throughout the entire machine. Emphasis is placed on the merits of high jacket-water temperatures. There are three principal types of cooling systems: radiator, heat-exchanger, and enclosed coils in cooling towers. Radiator cooling demands consideration of jacket-water circulation, core size, fan size, and temperature regulators. The shell-and-tube heat exchanger should be given consideration in installations wherein the engine is used to pump liquids. Cooling towers, when available, provide a facility for highly satisfactory engine cooling. Enclosed-coil systems take care of themselves, reducing the maintenance problem. Vapor-phase cooling makes use of the latent heat of water. By a simple arrangement, it becomes possible not only to operate the engine at high temperature, but automatically to maintain this temperature through any range of engine output and ambient temperature. Water problems demand consideration if the jacket-water system is to operate effectively. This presentation emphasizes the advantages of higher-range jacket-water temperatures, with jacket water carefully selected and maintained by diligent prevention of the entry of air or carbon dioxide to the cooling system.Water-jacket cooling is a matter of vital importance in the Otto-cycle natural-gas engine. It is not a casual problem, but one that demands careful consideration both by the designer and by the operator of the engine. The ,designer's greatest opportunities to improve the thermal efficiency of an engine lie in providing more efficient flame propagation and reducing waste heat to the jackets. For thermal efficiency one must consider:Air-cycle efficiencyVolumetric efficiencyMechanical efficiencyCombustion efficiency.The engineer is limited in theair-cycle efficiencyattainable by the maximum compression ratio which, in turn, is determined by the type of fuel used.Volumetric efficiencyis limited by the size of the inlet and exhaust valves, and by the size of the passages conducting air and fuel into the cylinders.Mechanical efficiencyaffords limited room for improvement; because conventional engines have sleeve-type bearings, trunk pistons, timing-gear trains, and valve actuating mechanisms-all of standard designs which are difficult to change.Combustion-efficiencyadvance offers a fertile field for the improvement of thermal efficiency through increased effectiveness of flame propagation and reduction of waste heat rejected to the jackets. To the operator, the cooling problem represents maintenance; for the condition of the cooling system is reflected throughout the entire machine. In general, the advantages of high jacket-water temperatures are :Vapors of the exhaust gases are not condensed on the cylinder walls; thus the sludging effect on oil in the crankcase is reduced.Reduced wear as a result of elimination of corrosion on cylinder walls.Decrease in formation of sulfurous acids.High thermal efficiency because of lower temperature difference between combustion chamber and jackets, resulting in lower heat transfer to the jacket water.",,American Petroleum Institute

Texter(Spang Chalfant Inc.),,,,,,API-41-009,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"The authors describe drill-pipe and tool-joint troubles and means of preventing them. It is stated that true twistoffs, spiral tears, and tension failures have been practically eliminated by improved pipe manufacturing and drilling practices. Failures at the last-engaged thread and leakage through threads also have been practically eliminated through improvements in design and in installation methods. Fatigue breaks are the most common type of drillpipe trouble today. They may be pure fatigue failures, but much more often are accelerated by notches or scars and by corrosion. Fatigue breaks may be reduced greatly by the use of adequate drill-collar weight, and this is probably the most important recommendation that can be made to increase the life of drill pipe. Troubles arising from worn pipe can be prevented best by keeping the pipe straight. Pipe usually is made crooked by running the string in compression. Collapsed pipe, although rare, usually occurs while making drill-stem tests. Wall eccentricity, internal erosion, and magnetism, although often discussed, have never been proved to be causes of drillpipe failures. Longitudinal splitting of the pipe ends of tool joints has been practically eliminated by the use of upset forgings. Splitting or swelling of the pin and box ends can be prevented by the use of special lubricants. Galling and wabble failures are the two most common tool-joint troubles today. The former can be prevented best by careful breaking in and adequate lubrication. Wabble failures result from operation of the joint while loose, and are aggravated by the modern practice of running drill strings in tension. They can be prevented best by adequate tonging and by care in handling to prevent damage to shoulders. Tool-joint wear cannot be prevented, but the effects and costs entailed can be minimized by the use of easily replaceable tool joints, oversize tool joints or wear subs, and by resleeving or hard-surfacing of either the tool joints or subs.INTRODUCTIONThis paper outlines practically all the principal types of drill-pipe and tool-joint failures. When the cure is known, practical ways of eliminating the trouble are explained in detail. When no complete cure has been found, acceptable ways of reducing the trouble are explained, if known. The paper is based upon many years of experience in the study of drill-stem failures by the writers and by their operator friends. The plan of this paper is to discuss drill-pipe and tool-joint failures, point by point, taking up the more obvious troubles first and then proceeding through the more obscure causes of failures. To complete the picture it is thought worthwhile to include brief discussions of early troubles--even though they now are almost non-existent-with modern manufacturing and drilling practice. As a matter of information, references to pertinent papers are given in the bibliography. Drill pipe is discussed first, because its varieties of troubles are more numerous.DRILL PIPE1. True TwistoffsThe term twistoff is used, erroneously, in the field for any type of failure in which the pipe becomes broken, or parted by any cause whatsoever. Its true meaning should be a failure of drill pipe due to pure torsion.",,American Petroleum Institute

Topical Committees on Drilling and Production Practice. The data submitted on some 2,300 wells from all sections of the country indicate a trend toward the drilling of smaller-diameter holes, both exploratory and proven, and completing wells with smaller casing. Substantial savings are being realized in initial well costs by this practice. No particular difficulty has been reported in drilling, completing, or producing the small-diameter wells. Nearly all the fields on which data were obtained are in the flowing stage; therefore, little information is available on artificial-lift installation in the small-diameter wells. But the predictions are that no trouble will be experienced with artificial-lift equipment in the small-diameter wells, except when a large volume of fluid will have to be produced with rod pumps. Small-diameter wells can be repaired by all commonly used methods as easily and cheaply as large diameter wells, except when the well is to be deepened or sidetracked. Then the small-diameter well is at a disadvantage. The great majority of the small-diameter wells were completed with 5 1/2-in.-OD casing, which is considered by the majority of those who submitted data to be the smallest practical casing size to use. The popular size hole to drill for setting 5 1/2-in.-OD casing seems to be 8 3/4-in. A 9 7/8-in: hole was drilled for the majority of the large-diameter wells reported, and 7-in.-OD casing was bet as the final casing string. The trend toward the drilling of smaller holes and setting smaller casing probably will continue because of the lower initial well cost, long expected flowing life of most fields, and the low rates of production on individual wells under enforced curtailment of production.PART 1 (BY I.

Rather it is an approach, and it is hoped that interest will be stimulated to the point of encouraging additional work on the subject. During recent years much interest has been shown in so-called slim-hole drilling. Much confusion has arisen due to lack of proper definition and classification as to depth and areas.

Following a brief outline of the history of the development of various well-surveying instruments during the past 60 years, the most necessary requirements for instruments and surveying methods are stated. The various types of instruments, their operation, the correction of magnetic-compass records, the preparation of survey maps, and the frequency of taking records are described. The development of directed controlled drilling, its objectives and requirements, are explained. A brief description of the various tools used in this art of drilling and their method of use is given. Two principal methods of obtaining side-wall core samples in connection with electrical logging are described. A new method of determining the direction and the angle of the dip of the formation by orienting core samples off the core trays is depicted.INTRODUCTIONIn recent years there have been placed at the disposal of the oil-production industry a large number of instruments and tools, the use of which made the operators abandon the rule-of-thumb practices of long standing and substitute for them improvements in drilling and completion technique, with a far greater recovery of the oil underground than formerly was considered possible. Some of the outstanding developments during the last decade would include the following:Well-surveying instruments.Controlled directed drilling.Side-wall sampling.Determination of the direction of dip of core samples by using the residual magnetism of minerals in the core sample.A brief resume of these developments, the factors which should be considered when they are employed, and their coordination with the improvements of the drilling technique are presented herewith.Underground Well SurveyingThe art of well surveying is not so recent as might be supposed. More than 60 years ago mining engineers recognized the problems encountered when a well or test hole is crooked. The first known instrument for detecting the deflection of a bore hole was introduced in 1873 by G. Nolten, Dortmund.1aThis comprised a glass bottle in which was placed an acid of sufficient strength to etch the interior of the glass when allowed to remain stationary for a predetermined length of time. Inasmuch as the axis of the bottle was parallel to the axis of the hole and the surface of the acid was horizontal, the angle of inclination from the vertical could be calculated. In conjunction with this instrument a compass was used, the needle of which could be arrested after a predetermined lapse of time. This instrument permitted only single readings. In 1884 E. F. MacGeorge brought out and tested at Sandhurst in Victoria, Australia, an instrument which marked a significant advance upon all preceding methods. This instrument, called a clinostat, consisted of a glass phial, in the bottom of which was a compass needle and in the top a small glass plummet. The phial was filled with hot transparent gelatin and lowered into the well. The density of the plummet and of the float supporting the needle was designed in such a way that they both would float freely in the hot gelatin.",,American Petroleum Institute

Pigott(Gulf Research and Development Co),,,,,,API-41-091,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper is a revision of the study completed in 1931 on the flow of mud in pipe, well bores, and mud pits, and on the lifting and releasing properties for cuttings. Tests made by Gregory on 4-in. pipe; by Ambrose and Loomis on capillary tubes; also on &frac12;- and 1-in. pipe and a modified McMichael absolute viscosimeter were used to demonstrate that the flow of mud can be predicted in the viscous region by utilizing the variable apparent viscosity in place of the usual constant viscosity for a liquid. In the turbulent region of flow all plastic effects and, consequently, variation of viscosity disappear; then mud can be treated as a true liquid. Experiments show that in this region the viscosity of mud is surprisingly low. The two different formulas which must be used for suspension of cuttings respectively in viscous and turbulent flow are discussed, together with modifications necessary for cuttings other than round particles. Calculations of resistance to flow in various parts of the mud-pumping system are given for several cases as illustrations based on friction factors taken from the writer's 1933 paper before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Tables are given of the lifting speed of the cuttings of different sizes in two different typical muds, both in the viscous and the turbulent region; and the effect of these changes of properties is discussed both as to effect in lifting and effect in the mud pit or other separating devices. General conclusions are that pressure drop and sustaining effect of any mud can be computed, provided the complete viscosity-velocity relations and the density of mud have been determined first. Raising velocity and density is most useful for lifting. High viscosity either in the viscous or turbulent region is undesirable, as it raises pump pressure in all cases, and in the viscous region is a serious obstacle to dropping cuttings. Gelling to sustain cuttings when circulation is stopped should be obtained by the use of high-gelling materials which, when in motion, do not add materially to the viscosity.The paper, Hydraulics of Mud-Circulating Systems, by Wesley W. Moore,? presented at the November 1940 meeting in Chicago reminded the writer that we had undertaken a similar study in 1931. The results were not published; but as this study covered the subject further than Mr. Moore's paper, it may be worth giving the results, which are just as reliable today as when they were made 10 years ago. The properties required of muds for lifting cuttings out of the hole, suspending them when circulation is stopped, and dropping them in the mud pit, frequently are opposed, and we must select the compromise properties, giving the best average results. Part of the hole, and generally all of the mud pit, are in viscous flow; the rest of the system is largely in turbulent flow. As the behavior of cuttings follows different laws in these two regions, it is necessary to take both conditions into account in determining flow conditions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Cardwell(Standard Oil Co. of Callfornia),,,,,,API-41-104,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper discusses the shearing-rate-shearing-stresstime relationships of drilling fluids. Because of the complexities of these relationships, special precautions must be taken in the design of drilling-fluid viscosimeters if the measurements are to be of definite, quantitative significance. A method is presented by which data obtained with a suitably designed instrument can be converted into absolute shearing-rate-shearing-stress curves. The procurement of rigorous viscosimetric data is suggested as the best means toward the practical solutions of field drilling-fluid-viscosity problems. In particular, it is indicated how the shear strength, if suitably determined, may be used to predict the size of the suspendable particles in a quiescent drilling fluid.INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to discuss 1, the shearing- stress-shearing-rate-time relationships of drilling fluids with particular reference to the low shearing rate region; and, 2, the bearing of these relationships upon the design of drilling-fluid viscosimeters.Shearing-Stress-Shearing-Rate-Time RelationshipsThe viscosity at any point of a fluid may be defined simply as the ratio of the shearing stress to the shearing rate at that point. Referring to Fig. 1, F is the shearing force acting over the area A. The ratio of F to A is the shearing stress t. The shearing rate, D, produced by the stress, t, is equivalent to the Y-velocity gradient; dv/dz The viscosity, &micro;, is defined by the following equation:(mathematical equation available in full paper)If the viscosity of a fluid is a function only of pressure and temperature, the fluid is said to be Newtonian, as exemplified by water. On the other hand, if the viscosity also varies with the applied shearing stress and, in some instances, with the amount of work performed upon the fluid, it is said to be non-Newtonian. Drilling fluids and related clay suspensions are non Newtonian. In general, their viscous behavior may be represented by shearing-rate-shearing-stress-time curves as presented diagrammatically in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 the viscosity of the fluid is proportional to the tangent of the angle between the D-axis and a radius vector from the origin to the point representing the viscous state of the fluid. Suppose that after a period of quiescence the fluid is subjected to a shearing rate D1; then at successive timest1, t2, t3etc., the viscosity of the fluid decreases toward an equilibrium value along line AB. Point B is the equilibrium point corresponding to the shearing rate D1. A similar procedure at the shearing rate D1' produces a path A'B' leading to the equilibrium point B.' Now suppose that, from some higher value, the shearing rate is lowered to D2Then the viscosity increases with time, as indicated by the line from G to the equilibrium point H. Actual data illustrating such viscosity decreases and increases as described are given by Ambrose and Loomis.1aThe curve OEF through all of the equilibrium points may be designated as the equilibrium viscosimetric curve. The specification of this curve for various drilling fluids is an essential object of current drilling-fluid viscosimetry.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lamberger(Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co.),,,,,,API-41-115,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"In oil-well pumping there are many known variables which directly affect the design and application of equipment used in the economical production of oil. To ascertain the individual effects of these variables on the performance and ratings of oil-well equipment and to augment the many theoretical considerations already given to them, Phillips Petroleum Company, Sargent Engineering Corporation, and Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company jointly made a series of more than 200 tests, extending over a continuous period of 6 months. The actual tests included independent variation of the speed, stroke length, counterweighting, working-barrel size, tubing diameter, and type of prime mover. Under these varying conditions, oscillographic film was used to show 14 simultaneous records of instantaneous loads and displacements occurring during a pumping cycle. Instruments were placed in the incoming power line, in the low-speed gear shaft, on the pitman, at two different points on the walking beam, on the polished rod, and at two different points in the sucker-rod string. Correlated with these were polished-rod dynagraph charts and bottom-hole dynamometer records. The paper covers that part of these tests which suggests the development of new formulas for predetermining, from a known set of well conditions:Peak polished-rod load.Pump plunger stroke.Peak crankshaft torque.These new formulas, with supporting data, are given, and results from their use compared with those obtained from existing formulas and with actual test results. Suggestions also are made that other perplexing problems incident to oil-well pumping may be solved conveniently with these same basic and fundamental test data.INTRODUCTIONSince oil-well pumping began, the existence of many variables which directly affect equipment ratings and indirectly influence the economies of production has been recognized. Much has even been written about the theoretical mechanics of oil-well pumping in an effort to segregate and control these variables, with the ultimate purpose of minimizing overall production costs which are reflected in all of the pumping equipment used on a well. Actual data of a fundamental and basic nature to temper the theories evolved for solving recognized pumping problems have been limited, at best, and usually have been obtained more or less haphazardly on wells in widely separated localities and under uncontrolled operating conditions. Such data, voluminous as they are, served valuable purposes; but they do not permit segregating the effects of important variables and determining their true relations to designs of well-pumping apparatus from the power source to the pump at the bottom of the well. Many oil-producing companies, form costly operation experiences, long had recognized the shortcomings of such existent test data and the need for some which are more factual and basic, but not until recently was there a direct effort made to obtain such data. Largely in the interest of attempting to improve economies in their own producing operations, the Phillips Petroleum Company, in the spring of 1940, in collaboration with Sargent Engineering Corporation and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, undertook the collection of comprehensive and exhaustive test data on a single pumping well in the Oklahoma City Field, for the purpose of facilitating an analytical study of the magnitude and types of loads and displacements simultaneously occurring during a pumping stroke at many important points in the mechanical system from the prime mover a t the surface to the pump at the bottom of the well.",,American Petroleum Institute

316,320874,,Factors Affecting The Use Of Gravel In Oil Wells,Kenneth E. Hill(University of California),,,,,,API-41-134,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"The use of gravel adjacent to the liners of oil wells is intended to decrease sand production and increase the oil-production rate. Theoretically and practically, both of these purposes can be attained by the use of gravel which has a size ratio of 8 when compared to the diameter of the sand at the 10-percentile point on the cumulative screen analysis. However, due recognition must be given to the fundamental laws underlying the use of the frequency cumulative curves in the choice of gravel size for screening unconsolidated sand. The thickness of gravel should be at least five gravel grain diameters. Preliminary field results indicate that, after initial flush production, gravel-pack wells have higher production rates, better sustained rates, and result in greater cumulative production than conventionally completed offset wells. This is a result of the ability to produce the gravel-pack wells at a greater percentage of their true potential capacity. Productivity indices which are lower for gravel-pack wells than for conventional wells are thought to be due to the use of mud instead of oil as the circulating medium. Decreased sand production and an increased production rate should be obtained from the use of gravel in oil wells if a uniformly packed, closely sized gravel, with a gravel-sand size ratio of not more than, eight and a thickness of at least five gravel grain diameters, is placed in the well using oil as the circulating medium.The placing of a screen of gravel about the liner of a well is essentially a process designed to increase the permeability and porosity of the material adjacent to the well. By means of this process two fundamental benefits should result:A decrease in the amount of sand migrating into the well bore.An increase in the production rate due to increasing the effective well diameter.Therefore, a gravel screen should provide less resistance to flow, after equilibrium has been established, than would the liner and formation without the gravel. At the same time sand must be prevented from migrating into the well bore. It is proposed to discuss the aspects of gravel packing under the two benefits mentioned above. Each advantage will be subdivided further into theoretical considerations and practical results.I. DECREASED SAND PRODUCTIONIt has been shown conclusively, both in the laboratory and in the field, that a gravel screen, properly chosen and suitably placed, is effective in preventing the migration of significant amounts of sand into the well bore. A brief resume of the various phases of this problem will be given herein.A. Theoretical ConsiderationsThe migration of sand through a gravel screen is a very complex phenomenon, and depends upon a number of variables. The more important of these are the size, placement and thickness of the gravel, the size and size distribution of the sand, and the hydrodynamic flow conditions. Probably the most important variable affecting the screening of unconsolidated sand is the ratio of the maximum diameter of a closely sized gravel to a significant grain diameter of the formation sample.",,American Petroleum Institute

Young(Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers),,,,,,API-41-144,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"Well potentials for use as the primary factor in allocation under the California uniform method are being established successfully by depth-pressure means in flowing, gas-lift, and pumping wells. Hazards of extrapolating the mean producing pressure-rate curve are discussed, and minimum practicable mean producing pressures are calculated within conservative limits. Present status of special studies is given, covering such topics as critical sand entry, pump capacity vs. depth, sonic-method tests, hydraulic unit tests, and gradient determination and estimation both in tubing and in the annulus. Acceptance of the depth-pressure method is general, but there is no evidence of a sudden swing toward it as an alternate to open-flow tests, nor is there any tendency for it to cause inflation of state potential. Incidental value of this work is great in widening circle of operators who are familiar with this analytical method, and in promoting more general acceptance of reservoir-behavior concepts.INTRODUCTIONCurtailment in California has been made possible through the voluntary cooperation of the great majority of oil producers. The method of allocating production has varied from time to time to suit changing conditions, and in May 1939 a uniform system1awas adopted giving each well in the state an allotment based primarily on its individual well potential. This additional emphasis on individual well potentials, which previously had been set solely by demonstrative tests, led to the adoption of an alternative method for potential determination based upon subsurface-pressure measurements. Rules and regulations governing the depth-pressure procedure were developed by a committee of engineers employed in the industry. This group, known as the Depth-Pressure Advisory Committee, has a revolving membership which advises the Oil Administrator in the interpretation of these rules, and recommends such changes and special studies as may be necessary. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the operations of the depth-pressure system since its final approval in November 1939. Inasmuch as detailed discussion of the rules has been published elsewhere, only a brief review of their present form is given herein. Data are presented to show the relative accuracy of the test methods, their economic value to the industry, and the degree of their acceptance by operators. Specific problems of an engineering nature have arisen from the interpretation of depth-pressure data; these are discussed, together with the methods of approach used in attempting their solution.RESUME OF RULES FOR DETERMINING POTENTIALS FROM SUBSURFACE-PRESSURE DATAFundamentals of MethodThe method for applying subsurface pressures to potential determination is based on the measurement of producing pressures in the well bore opposite the producing horizon, together with corresponding rates of production. From a correlation of these data, a calculated potential is resolved for a specified minimum subsurface producing pressure. To procure dependable results it is necessary to specify accuracy in the measurement of both pressure and production rate. Equilibrium conditions must be attained, and specific rules are included for this purpose.Mean PressureThe long producing intervals commonly encountered in California wells make it necessary to interpret the vertical distribution of pressure across the productive horizon to arrive at a mean pressure * representing the entire zone.",,American Petroleum Institute
318,320876,,Pressure Core Analysis,J.J. Mullane(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-41-163,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"Data obtained with the Carter pressure core barrel are presented. It is shown that a more complete analysis of the core now can be obtained, and that the usefulness of core analysis has been extended considerably. Gas-oil-ratio data obtained with the pressure core barrel have been shown to be in agreement with the production gas-oil ratio as determined in the field. It has been found that, in addition to gas, both oil and water are produced from cores, even though taken from wells that produce no water. A correlation has been observed between the oil produced from cores taken in a given horizon and the initial potential of the well. A part, at least, of the water produced has been shown to be connate water. With the more complete data obtained with the pressure core barrel, it is believed that more reliable estimates of reserves can be made now front core data. Information as to the mechanism by which cores are polluted by water from the drilling mud is given. Evidence is given to show that two types of invasion are operative; these are: a vertical invasion ahead of the bit, and a radial invasion of the core.INTRODUCTIONCore samples usually are taken from formations believed to contain oil or gas. From the analysis of such samples it is desirable to ascertain: 1, if there is oil or gas present; and, 2, how much oil, gas, and water there is in the pore spaces of the rocks. In other words, it is necessary to evaluate oil-field properties for the purpose of commercial exploitation or, in the case of property under development, to estimate reserves. Another use of such data that is of importance is in old developed fields. In this case it is often desirable to core between wells in order to determine whether the well density used was sufficient to give the best possible recovery. The importance of these problems is well known to the petroleum industry. The ideal solution to these problems would be to obtain a sample of the formation of interest in its original state. However, due to the invasion of the formation sample by water from the drilling fluid during the drilling operation, the sample which actually is obtained is not in the original condition, but has been changed materially. The first step, then, in the analysis of cores is to estimate the amount of water from the drilling mud that enters the core, and, further, to obtain information on the nature of the disturbance that occurs during and after this invasion. Core drilling with a conventional core barrel does not permit sufficiently complete observations to evaluate a core sample properly., As the core barrel is brought up the hole, the pressure is reduced-and all the gas in the sample is lost, and with it some of the liquid contents of the core. All that is left are the residual liquids, i.e., the dead oil and water. The water is a mixture of the original formation water and water from the drilling mud, and nothing is known of what occurred either during the drilling process or during the time the barrel was being brought out of the hole.",,American Petroleum Institute

It will be evident to the critical reader that the broad use of core-analysis data involves many assumptions regarding fluid content and movement in a reservoir. A section has been added, therefore, discussing the present state of knowledge on which the necessary assumptions must be based, and what must be done to improve this state of knowledge.I. SCOPE OF CORE ANALYSISPorosity (P)In order to find how much space there may be available for oil and gas in any reservoir rock, the porosity is measured. The porosity of a rock is the percentage of the bulk volume which is not filled by solid rock material. These interstices or pores have a great variety of sizes and shapes and degrees of interconnection. Some of them are not connected at all, but are sealed off hermetically, and represent isolated porosity. The interconnected pores represent effective porosity, because they may become effective in the recovery of oil and gas from the reservoir. The sum of effective and isolated porosity is equal to the porosity of the rock. Both effective and isolated pores may contain all three reservoir fluids--oil, gas, and water-but usually only those fluids in the effective pores should be considered as mobile or in any part recoverable. Porosity of rock varies from almost zero to about 60 per cent, the range for most oil reservoirs being from 10 to 40 per cent, with an average of 20 to 25 per cent in California. In California, the fraction of this porosity that may be considered as effective varies from almost 100 per cent to about 85 per cent for some highly cemented sands. The effective fraction averages almost 95 per cent, which makes it relatively unimportant whether effective or total porosity is measured on these particular sands. Shales frequently have porosities from 10 to 25 per cent, usually behaving like isolated porosity. A laboratory technique has been adopted for measuring porosity of loose sands. A small amount (2 ml) of kerosine is pipetted accurately into a 50-ml graduate, and about an equal volume of dry sand is added. This is tamped into a tight pack with a I-in. flat-ended rod. The process is continued with about 1-ml additions of sand and just enough kerosine to fill the sand pores (but no excess), until about 20 ml of pack has been built. The bulk volume and the kerosine volume allow a direct calculation of total porosity. By comparison with effective porosity measured by a Kobe porosimeter, this method gives results which must be multiplied by 0.86 to give equivalent effective porosities of very soft but coherent sands.",,American Petroleum Institute

In the Guntong Complex operation, production from satellite platforms were cooled by sub-sea transit and made the emulsion processing of crude at the central processing platform(CPP) difficult. Emulsion is broken at the CPP using demulsifier chemical and the effectiveness is temperature dependant. Ineffectiveness of the demulsifier chemical coupled with constraints on BS W (Basic Sediment Water) and produced water discharge quality eventually created a production bottleneck as the satellite production water cut increased. Recognizing emulsion chemical treatment is still applicable but ineffective due to insufficient temperature, various heat addition options were evaluated while taking into account the set-up and limitations of existing facilities. The ‘hotwash' concept, where the ‘hot' central processing platform fluid is mixed with the incoming ‘cold' satellite streams to raise processing temperature was implemented as it is also the most cost effective solution. As Guntong Complex is a matured field, the project has greatly increased the ability of CPP's facilities to sustain satellite production by implementing the ‘hotwash' concept.IntroductionGuntong Complex is one of the main oil producers in Peninsula Malaysia. Crude from these fields is produced at the central processing or mother platform (CPP), and its five satellite platforms. Total production from this asset is approximately 90kbd. The CPP accounts for 10% of total complex production, with the remaining 90% from the satellites (Fig.1). The CPP liquid production is about 20% crude and 80% water. The satellite platforms' full well stream (FWS) is sent to the central processing platform via sub-sea pipelines. The CPP production facilities were designed such that the FWS from the CPP and its satellites would be treated individually. Each process train has a first and second stage process vessel, designed for three phase separation. Gas from the vessels are combined and compressed by a common compressor system, which is for gas sales, gas lift and gas injection. Produced water is treated using corrugated plate interceptor (CPI) and induced gas flotation (IGF) vessels to reduce oil in water content below regulatory limits prior to being discharged overboard. The CPP and satellites' production are commingled and sent, via a pumping platform, to the onshore gathering facility for export. The CPP also has auxiliary equipment such as dehydration, waste heat recovery units and turbine generators (Fig.2).As the onshore export facility has limited crude treatment facilities, there is a limit on the percentage of water in the crude leaving offshore facilities. Excess water could potentially result in offspec crude shipments. There is certain allowable BS W limit for the crude leaving Guntong Complex. Past experience has shown that without treatment, water would be retained in the crude stream in the form of emulsified droplets. Retention of water in this form results in a BS W content being as high as 10% - 20%. Production, particularly from satellite platforms is limited to the ability of the CPP to break emulsion and separate oil and water so that the departing main oil line (MOL) BS W stays within the required limit.Initially Guntong production did not require facilities to treat emulsion. The water content of the FWS was acceptable, hence only two phase separation was performed at the CPP, with all liquid production sent to the onshore gathering facilities. As the field matured, water production increased, together with the amount of emulsion produced. The FWS water content eventually exceeded MOL limits. To maximize production, water and emulsion had to be removed from the crude sent to the MOL. Conventional methods were chosen to resolve emulsion, i.e. injecting demulsifier chemical into the process streams.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers

Klinkenberg(Shell Development Co),,,,,,API-41-200,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"The standard procedure for determining the permeability of porous media according to APZ Code No. 27 (first edition, October 1935) is based on the fundamental assumption that, as long as the rate of flow is proportional to the pressure gradient, the permeability constant of a porous medium is a property of the medium, and is independent of the fluid used in its determination. Although this is true for most liquids, the permeability constant as determined with gases is dependent upon the nature of the gas, and is approximately a linear function of the reciprocal mean pressure. This effect can be explained by taking into account the phenomena of slip, which are related closely to the mean free paths of the gas molecules. The apparent permeability extrapolated to infinite pressure gives a permeability constant which is a characteristic of the porous medium only.I. IntroductionIt has become common practice in the oil industry to determine the permeability of core material with dry air; the equipment usually employed for this determination is arranged to operate with the outlet of the sample at or near atmospheric pressure.1aThis practice is based on the fundamental assumption that, as long as Darcy's law is obeyed, i.e., as long as the rate of flow is proportional to the pressure gradient,? the permeability constant of a porous medium is a property of the medium, and is independent of the fluid used in its determination.8Therefore, the results obtained by laboratory measurements with air are taken to be applicable to the homogeneous flow of either oil or gas in underground reservoirs. The fundamental assumption that the permeability of a porous medium is independent of the fluid used in its determination is illustrated by Muskat4with a few measurements of highly permeable sandstones to air and liquid. However, Muskat5gives a table of results of measurements on the permeability to water and air of a number of oil sands, carried out by Fancher, Lewis, and Barnes,6showing large discrepancies between the permeability to air and water-most values found for water being lower than for air. Many cases of such discrepancies between the permeabilities to air and those to water and other liquids also were observed during investigations carried out in the laboratories of the Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and of the Shell Development Company, Emeryville, Calif. In general it was found that, with highly permeable media, the differences between liquid and air permeabilities were small, whereas these differences were considerable for media of low permeability. These discrepancies made it desirable to, investigate the validity of the assumption that the permeability of a porous medium is independent of the nature of the fluid with which the determination is carried out. The investigation has shown that the permeability to a gas is a function of the mean free path of the gas molecules, and thus depends on factors which influence the mean free path, such as the pressure, temperature, and the nature of the gas.",,American Petroleum Institute

Kennedy(Gulf Research and Development Co.),,,,,,API-41-214,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper describes typical chemical treatments for reduction of gas- and water-oil ratios by the plugging of selected portions of the producing formations, and mentions briefly similar treatments applied to cable-tool drilling wells to shut off excessive water. Records of 6 water plugging treatments, chosen to represent various successful treating methods, and 11 gas plugging treatments are included. The latter group consists of all the applications up to the present time of chemical plugging methods to the wells of two major companies in the Goldsmith Pool, Ector County, Texas. Conditions essential for successful application of chemical plugging methods are discussed.INTRODUCTIONThe possibility of treating formations penetrated by the drill to render them impermeable appears to have been appreciated first by Swan.1aHis process consisted of vaporizing and solidifying naphthalene. In the following year Van Mills2recommended the use of solutions such as sodium silicate and sodium carbonate which react with oil-field waters to form solid plugging agents. From the time of Swan and Van Mills up to 1935, little attention appears to have been paid to the question of formation plugging, probably because of disappointing results of treatments made with these types of materials. Appreciation of the importance of the problem in recent years is shown by the fact that, since 1935, forty-four U. S. patents have been issued, dealing more or less directly with formation plugging, and a large number of experimental and commercial well treatments have been made. In a recent article3Torrey gives an excellent review of various methods for the selective exclusion of water and gas from wells. His paper describes the several alternative methods available for the purpose, especial emphasis being placed on cementing technique. The present paper is devoted to presenting the available data on chemical treatments-particularly on treatments performed in the last few years.Plugging MethodsWhen it is desired to plug a given portion of open hole in an oil or gas well, there are three general methods by which it may be accomplished: squeeze cementing, cementing of liners with subsequent perforation, and chemical injection. Experience shows that each method has definite advantages under certain conditions. Due to its hardness, cement has definite advantages in plugging large pores, where softer material might be ineffective. It has the disadvantage of requiring drilling tools for the removal of excess cement in the hole; and, if tools are not conveniently at hand, the job may be unnecessarily expensive. Cemented liners have the advantage of protecting loose or caving formations, and thus this method may be effective in certain areas where cementing or chemical treatment might fail. Chemical plugging of formations differs from plugging with cement in two important respects: First, in .regard to their ability to penetrate the formations, chemicals now in use have the property of changing from thin liquids, while being injected, to gels of variable hardness after they have set in place. This is in contrast to cement, which comprises a suspension of fine particles having very limited depths of penetration into the body of the formation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dixon(Foran Boatright and Dixon),,,,,,API-41-221,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"The authors present in practical form a discussion of factors which, in the ultimate analysis, determine the probable degree of success and profit to be derived from a cycling enterprise. In order to coordinate the presentation of many divergent subjects, the paper is written as though directed to persons who seek a pattern about which they may attack intelligently the problem of inspecting and possibly developing a cycling project.INTRODUCTIONA great deal has been written concerning the fundamental laws governing the phenomena of retrograde condensation, the design and operation of cycling plants, and other technical phases of cycling projects; but relatively little attention has been paid the more broad and fundamental business aspects that must be considered by the average operator. Cycling operations in condensate-bearing gas fields are assuming an important role in the oil industry. Thirty-one plants, with a combined processing capacity of some one and one-quarter billion cubic feet of gas per day, now are recovering approximately twenty-five thousand barrels of condensate daily. Approximately three times as much gas was processed by cycling plants in 1940 as in 1939; contemplated plants for 1941 may bring the total amount of gas being processed to twice the 1940 figure. Obviously, there are definite reasons for this rapid increase. The art of cycling has progressed well beyond the experimental stage, and its development has provide a means of recovering condensate reserves that otherwise irretrievably would be lost and of conserving dry gas for future use. Cycling represents a decided advance in production technique; the combined effects of pressure maintenance and gas drive in a properly designed cycling project result in high recovery efficiency without physical waste. Cycling projects are more subject to self-enforced economic proration than to governmental proration. Distillate wells, in many cases, can be called little more than dry holes, presuming the usual lack of gas market. A wildcat well, finding distillate but no oil shows, cannot be called dry, and yet the distillate cannot be produced by conventional separator methods because of wasteful gas-liquid ratios. In order to protect the well investment and to hold the lease, it is common for the operator to set pipe and thus bring to being another of those enigmas, a distillate well. Were such a discovery an oil well, 20-acre offsets would be justified, and have almost certain possibilities of success but being a distillate well, this offset distance must be increased materially, with attendant uncertainty of securing any kind of production. In selecting the offset distance, the operator may presume that there will be a ring of oil, that elusive and usually unprofitable strip sometimes found between the water and the gas, or he may presume that the entire structure is gas, in which latter case an offset well on 160-acre spacing might have no value if the final method of production is by cycling. If the distillate content and the well pressure are average; the total condensate reserve in the reservoir in which this hypothetical well is completed will be about 50 bbl per acre foot.",,American Petroleum Institute

McCarty(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-41-228,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper is a presentation of the potentiometric method to determine the wave fronts swept out by the dry gas in displacing the wet gas from a reservoir in a recycling operation. Given in the paper is the experimental technique, as well as the mathematical interpretation, in comparing electrical phenomena to the flow conditions in the reservoir.Model analysis recently has achieved importance for the engineer in producing gas-distillate fields. The purpose of such studies is to obtain the necessary data on the arrangement of input and producing wells that will give the greatest recovery of wet gas in a reservoir, as well as the essential curves showing the instantaneous and overall ratios of wet to total gas production that can be expected during the life of an operation. The latter information, in particular, offers the criterion for fixing the depreciation on the recycling-plant equipment, and gives the expected life of economic operation. The purpose of this paper is to present a method of model analysis whereby these characteristic curves can be produced with a greater degree of accuracy than by methods heretofore employed. Model analyses, in connection with flooding operations in reservoirs, have been studied by Wyckoff,1aBotset,1Swearingen2and others. Muskat2has presented a mathematical solution to the relative movement of the wave-front travel from the analytics of the potential and streamline distribution. With reference to the experimental investigations, the methods employed are based on the same principle, viz., the transference of ions in an electrolyte from one pole to another, leaving a colored background to represent the flooding-out effect. Wyckoff and Botset used a cardboard, containing a solution of potassium sulfate, and an indicator to represent the field. The flooded area was indicated by the red coloration of the hydroxyl ions in moving from the negative to the positive poles. Swearingen employed a solution of zinc ammonium chloride set in agar gel as the field. Glass electrodes, containing copper ammonium chloride, were used as the input wells, and electrodes of zinc ammonium chloride as the output wells. Under the influence of a potential, a background was traced out showing the blue coloration of the copper ions in the flooding pattern. The authors have employed both of these methods in gas-recycling problems. The results of their experiments have indicated that Swearingen's method is preferable to that of Wyckoff and Botset, as it proved to be much better adaptable to these studies. In Fig. 1 and 2 are shown photographs of an experimental arrangement using Swearingen's method. Other than some changes in the technique of performance, the principle is the same. In Fig. 1 is a close view of the model, showing the input and output wells. The input wells are dark in this picture, due to the blueness of the copper solution. The actual pictures of the flooding out effects are photographed from under the table, through a glass top on which the model is located, in order to cut out of the photograph all the superstructure of the electrodes and leave only the actual flooding pattern of the field.",,American Petroleum Institute

Bartok(Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-41-243,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper consists essentially of two parts:Tension-leak tests.Photoelastic study of stresses in casing joints.Leakage tests were made on casing joints subjected simultaneously to internal pressure and increasing tensile load. The loading under pressure was continued until full leakage was obtained. Pressure then was removed and the joint pulled to destruction. Results indicated that the standardized 8-pitch roundthread casing joint had leak resistance in tension beyond that required in service. Yield strength of the joint was apparently the controlling factor. Long-thread joints had higher leak resistance than short-thread joints, although it was questionable if this extra tightness was of practical value. Thread lengths intermediate to API long- and short-threads appeared advisable. Thread makeup was a critical factor, three threads pullup being the optimum. Differential in taper lowered leak resistance, but this tendency was overcome by proper makeup. Photoelastic study developed fundamental information concerning stresses in casing joints, supplementing and explaining the results of tension-leak tests. The usefulness of the photoelastic method in analyzing stresses in casing joints was pointed out.INTRODUCTIONData presented in this paper establish clearly that standard API round thread has leak resistance in tension beyond that required in service. To establish this point, leakage tests were made on 8-pitch roundthread casing joints subjected simultaneously to internal gas pressure and to tension loading. Tests were carried out on 4 1/2-in.,5 1/2-in., 7-in., and 8 5/8ft-in. grade J-55 casing. To answer questions relative to stresses acting in the casing joint and their possible effect on leakage, and to supplement information developed in the tension-leak tests, a photoelastic analysis of the problem was made also. Up to the time of these tests there was little definite information on leak resistance in tension. This investigation provides:Experimental data that show how casing will perform under tension and pressure in service.A testing procedure by which the leakage problem can be approached from the corrective angle, for example:With higher pressures.With more sensitive leak-measuring methods.With various thread lubricants.The tension-leak test program, as presented herein, has the following objectives:Determination of leak resistance of casing joints in tension.Effects of the following factors on leak resistance in tension:Thread length.Makeup.Taper differential.Effects of stresses acting in casing joints. The scope of the paper is limited to casing joints using standardized API 8-pitch, round thread.TEST PREPARATIONPreparation of specimens for testing involved the following steps:Selection of samples.Threading.Making up joints.Welding on saddles and tapping for gas connections.Plugging with soft-wood rounds.Welding in bulkheads.Welding one end of coupling.Fig. 1 shows the design of the assembly.

327,320883,,Casing Window Practices In The Illinois Basin,C.G. Herrington(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-41-274,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"A multiplicity of hard, compact, productive sandstones in the Illinois Basin area, which initially require shooting with nitroglycerin, furnished the incentive for intensive development of casing window practices whereby two or more sands could be produced through a common well bore. Three types of windows are discussed- the first two involving special alloy metals and the third requiring the opening of windows in the steel casing strings of older wells completed before the advent of the alloys. In addition to a description of the equipment used and completion methods for each of the three types of windows, statistical data pertaining to the number of installations, success percentages, and average costs are presented.INTRODUCTIONExtensive exploitation of the Eastern Interior Coal Basin during the past three years has resulted in the development of production from numerous sandstone bodies in the Chester series of the Upper Mississippian group, with as many as three pay zones frequently being present at a given location. These sandstones are of a tightly cemented compact character, and normally are separated by cavy shale beds ranging in thickness from 5 ft to 150 ft. To obtain satisfactory production rates, pay formations must be shot with nitroglycerin, which requires their exposure in an open hole. Desirability of producing through a single well bore-usually by pumping-two or more oil sands and of protecting the open hole from the intervening soft shale bodies led to intensive development of multi-sand completion practices. Early experiments were confined to the use of removable casing sections, employing special alloy metals previously developed for other commercial service. The first installation of removable alloy casing as a window section was made by The Carter Oil Company early in the development of the Louden Pool in Fayette County, Illinois, with a metal consisting largely of aluminum. Destruction of this metal is accomplished most satisfactorily by drilling, due to the physical and chemical characteristics of the metal which presently will be discussed. Further experiments shortly resulted in the use of a second alloy metal, consisting largely of magnesium, as a removable casing window section. This metal first was employed- as a casing window in the Louden Pool, and its composition is such as to make possible its destruction by exposure to ordinary oil-well acid. After widespread application of the window method of well completion had proved its practicability, it was deemed expedient to cut windows opposite pay formations behind the oil string in a , number of earlier wells by means of a special steel casing mill, first employed in the milling of casing windows by The Carter Oil Company at Louden, III., in September 1939. Continuous efforts to improve multi-sand completion technique have been so successful that the practice has been adopted widely, and is now regarded as a commonplace completion method throughout the basin area. Numerous methods of equipping and completing multi-sand wells now are being pursued, but only the most generally accepted practices will be outlined in the following discussion. Initially, reduced-diameter window sections were preferred on the assumption that destruction of the metal could be accomplished best with a pilot-type drag bit instead of with conventional wall scrapers.",,American Petroleum Institute
328,320884,,A Practical Evaluation Of Cements For Oil Wells,R. Floyd Farris(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-41-283,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"This paper describes a special test procedure for evaluating cement slurries at temperature and pressure conditions which are reasonably close to those actually prevailing in the slurry during a cement job. Actual cementing conditions, as determined by extensive testing during cementing operations in various fields, are simulated in the pressure-type consistometer in a manner which relates stirring time as a function of well depth. The results are made directly applicable to field problems by representing cement performance at various hypothetical well depths on a depth-vs.-total-cementing time chart which the field engineer may use as a guideA practical laboratory evaluation of cements for oil wells might be defined as one wherein actual cementing temperatures and pressures are applied to a test sample at a rate and magnitude identical to those imposed on the slurry as it travels down the pipe, and where results are found that have a direct relationship to the slurry behavior in a cementing operation. The present common methods of testing cements relate stirring time and temperature; but the pressure factor is neglected entirely, and the temperature does not simulate completely conditions existing during cement jobs. Therefore, an investigation of these factors was started in 1938 for the purpose of developing information which might lead to a more practical laboratory expression of cement performance. The first problem attempted was to evaluate the effects of pressure on the properties of cement slurries. In a paper1apresented before the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers in New York in February 1940, it was shown that the stirring time of some slurries at atmospheric pressure is reduced by as much as 54 per cent by the application of a pressure of 5,000 psi. The tests in that phase of the work were conducted at constant temperatures and pressures and, of course, the results were not in a form designed to apply directly to field problems, but the fact was established that pressure is an important factor which must not be overlooked in any practical evaluation of cement slurries. Next, attention was turned to cement jobs in the field for information regarding actual cementing temperatures and pressures. After having made several tests in various fields, general relationships were established on which it was possible to base a special test procedure closely simulating actual cementing temperatures and pressures. It is the purpose of this paper, therefore, to describe the basis of this method of evaluating cement slurries and to show that the results thus obtained may be applied directly to field cementing problems.TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES IN THE FIELDThe basis of this method of testing and evaluating cements may be visualized more clearly if the question of cement testing is sidetracked temporarily and attention is focused on actual operating conditions in the field. The order of the discussion will be a consideration of well temperatures and pressures in the static state, followed by a discussion of the same factors in a system circulating mud; for, it will be shown later, that mud-circulating temperatures and pressures may be expressed in general relationships with depth in a manner very similar to the well-known methods of approximating static temperatures and pressures.",,American Petroleum Institute

The use of gel cements for oil-well cementing has yielded both successful and unsuccessful results, and a more thorough knowledge of the properties and behavior of gel-cement slurries should result in more satisfactory cement jobs. When the water-cement ratio of the slurry is less than a certain critical value, which depends on the type of cement, there will be little or no settling out, and the set volume will practically equal the fluid volume. When the water-cement ratio exceeds this value, there will be a settling out of cement before the initial set takes place. Under the latter condition the addition of bentonite, on account of its colloidal properties, will hold the cement particles in suspension for a longer period of time than in a neat slurry having the same water-cement ratio. This will result in a set volume of slurry practically equal to the fluid volume, even though an excess of mixing water is used. The author gives information on the results to be expected when bentonite is added to portland-cement slurry, with suggested applications.INTRODUCTIONBentonite, or colloidal clay, first was used as an admixture with cement and water in oil-well-cementing operations about 10 years ago. Since that time it has been used periodically and to a greater or lesser extent in practically every section of the oil country as a possible solution for certain difficulties encountered in obtaining satisfactory cement jobs or in an attempt to secure satisfactory jobs at a lower cost. The results obtained, in the opinions of various operators, have ranged from very successful to unsuccessful, and the use of bentonite with cement is still a controversial question. This is evident from records of cementing operations in many fields where, under the same 'conditions, various percentages of bentonite were used by ,some operators and not at all by others. It is thought that a more thorough knowledge and understanding of the properties and behavior of bentonite- cement slurries will aid operators in determining whether their use should result in more satisfactory cement jobs. This paper presents a summary review of these properties as compared to neat-cement slurry, with a brief discussion of their application to certain phases of oil-well cementing. As a preliminary, step, different methods of adding finely ground bentonite to the slurry will be considered. As would be expected, it was found a thorough dispersion in the mixing water prior to adding the cement produced a greater effect than when it was premixed dry, the ratio being about 1 to 2. In other words, to obtain certain properties in a gel-cement slurry, it was necessary to premix twice as much dry bentonite with the cement as would accomplish the same result when dry bentonite was dispersed thoroughly in the mixing water.",,American Petroleum Institute

Knowlton(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-41-303,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"The development of petroleum engineering as a distinct and independent profession is discussed. The principal types of administrative organizations in general use by the oil companies are explained briefly. It is stated that the effectiveness of the association between a production engineer and any operating co-worker is in some degree directly proportional to the mutual respect and confidence which exist between them. By the selection and proper development of capable men for the jobs, by definitely instructing them as to their responsibility and authority, and by requiring joint and concerted action by them, the association of the production engineer and his operating co-worker will be more harmonious, more efficient, and more profitable.The problem involved in the consideration of a closer association between the production engineer and his operating co-worker is one of personnel or employee relations-a problem which merits careful attention by those determining the duties and responsibilities of engineers and the lines of authority through which engineering effort is' correlated with operation in the field. Petroleum engineering has become in the very short period of 10 years a widely recognized profession; however, production of oil always has been an engineering task. Pioneer producers had to devise and invent machinery to drill deep into the earth, harness and control the energy in subsurface reservoirs, produce increasing quantities of oil to sell at lower and lower prices and, at the same time, bring about more conservative exploitation of a limited resource. The skill, the art, and the invention that contribute to the modern industry properly are recognized as petroleum engineering. This work can be shared by anyone in the industry. It is not the monopoly of a favored group. It is not a patented practice granted only to those possessing degrees and titles from colleges and universities. One needs but to practice engineering precepts in oil production to become a petroleum engineer. This discussion, however, pertains to the association-the relationship-between the technically educated, technically trained engineer and his operating co-worker. The advent of these men into the industry has been through a gradual process. The first petroleum engineers confined their, efforts to limited problems. Although the first successes were not overwhelming, they were sufficiently satisfactory to encourage additional undertakings. Drastic changes in methods used in the development of properties and in the production and handling of oil, many of which were the results of engineering effort, opened a fertile but complicated field to which an ever-expanding corps of production engineers was introduced. Each new development opened new horizons for engineering effort. Proration enabled the engineers to study the effect of varied rates of production. Development of geophysics brought forth deeper pools to be exploited. From task to task, step by step, the petroleum engineer gradually established himself as an integral part of the modern oil-production organization. Now we are concerned with the question of where, in our producing organization, the engineer properly fits so as to secure for that organization the greatest benefit from his scientific talents. Even more, we are concerned with the efficiency of the juncture of engineering thoughts with the ideas and efforts of the operating personnel.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lace(California Institute of Technology),,,,,,API-41-308,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"A discussion of some of the methods currently available for the prediction of the thermodynamic and phase behavior of naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures is presented. The concept of equilibrium in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems is discussed, and the utility of the fugacity as an index of the equilibrium in heterogeneous systems is described. The available background of experimental information pertaining to this problem is indicated, and the fields in which additional experimental work is necessary are pointed out. The objective of this discussion primarily is to indicate the status of such methods of prediction and the possibilities of improving their accuracy as additional information accumulates.INTRODUCTIONThe prediction of the thermodynamic and phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures is of practical industrial importance. In earlier stages of the petroleum industry's development, Raoult's law1awas combined with the concept of the perfect gas in order to permit prediction of the approximate behavior of multi-component hydrocarbon systems. However, it was found that such methods were not sufficiently descriptive of actuality to be satisfactory. George Granger Brown and co-workers2-4proposed that hydrocarbon phases be considered to be ideal solutions5and applied this concept to the prediction of the phase behavior of these systems. AS experimental measurements accumulated, it was found that this concept did not describe adequately the behavior of mixtures at elevated pressures, and more elaborate methods became necessary. The petroleum industry has attempted continuously to make use of such experimental information as has become available in the solution of the inherently complex problems associated with the design and operation of field and refinery equipment. Thus far, the problem has shown a tendency to become increasingly complex as more facts relating to the properties of hydrocarbon mixtures become available. For example, naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures have been found to yield two, and possibly in some cases three, essentially liquid or plastic phases6,7,under the conditions encountered in nature. The contributions to the experimental knowledge of hydrocarbon behavior have been widespread, and for the most part result from investigations supported by the petroleum industry in its own laboratories or in educational institutions. The present discussion attempts to present a resume of the methods currently available for the estimation of the properties of hydrocarbon mixtures from a knowledge of the state of the system in question.THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONSThe methods of prediction so far proposed are directed toward the estimation of the behavior of a system which is at equilibrium at a particular state. The concept of a system at a state of equilibrium is one of the most important ones in the fields of phase equilibrium and thermodynamics. A system may be said to be at equilibrium when its intensive properties have no tendency to change with time. As Lewis has said, a state of equilibrium is a state of rest. For example, a mixture consisting of oil and gas may be placed in a container of constant total volume, and a device for the measurement of pressure, such as a Bourdon tube, attached. Immediately after the gas and liquid have been introduced into the vessel, it is found that the pressure declines slowly as the gas diffuses into the liquid. Such a system would not be considered at equilibrium.",,American Petroleum Institute

Standing(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-41-326,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"Procedures and factors which affect the prediction of phase and volumetric relations in mixtures of natural hydrocarbons are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated and experimental results are given for 3 systems yielding crude oil varying in gravity from 27 to 55 deg API at 60160 deg F, and gas-oil ratios from 525 to 10,200 cu ft per bbl, respectively. The volume calculations are based upon the method of partial volumes as proposed by W. N. Lacey and B. H. Sage. The influence of items, such as the viscosity-gravity-factor correction on the methane equilibrium constants for the nature of the hexanes plus; the estimation of the volume of the heptanes plus at high temperatures and pressures; the estimation of the heptanes plus equilibrium constant in the isothermal retrograde region; and the use of the differential vaporization process for determination of the residual oil in the formation-volume computations, are discussed in detail.INTRODUCTIONThe intent of this paper is to discuss the prediction, by computation, of the volumetric and phase relations in natural hydrocarbon systems, and to compare the results with those obtained by direct measurements in a laboratory apparatus. There are various approaches to this problem, and each method of computation demands special correlations of the available data on hydrocarbons.1,2,3aDuring the past eight years the American Petroleum Institute has sponsored API Research Project 37 under the supervision of W. N. Lacey at the California Institute of Technology. This program is intended primarily to obtain data from which the volumetric and phase behavior of natural hydrocarbons may be predicted. At this writing the background of experimental and analytical work has permitted the publication of a method which can be employed by petroleum engineers to estimate the volumes and phase relations of mixtures of naturally occurring hydrocarbons. The approach to the prediction problem is fundamentally exact in principle, but up to the present time there are insufficient data to provide more than tentative correlations, or to realize the true behavior of all the constituents of a mixture. The general procedure has been considered carefully in the several publications of the American Petroleum Institute,4-7by Lacey and Sage, and their co-workers, and will not be reviewed here. It is assumed that those who are interested in the details of the calculations are familiar with the publications. In general, the nomenclature and various algebraic expressions employed in this paper are the same as those employed in the publications from API Research Project 37. The justification for this paper is the discussion of the several items in the computations which must be evaluated by means that have not been published previously or which require data which have not been available.

Bartel(University of Michigan.),,,,,,API-41-341,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1941,"Very little data on the surface forces active at the interfaces of actual petroleum reservoirs exist. Data on surface forces obtained for interfaces of simplified systems of pure materials must be used with caution when applied to actual production problems, because of the marked depression of interfacial tensions often caused by adsorption of polar impurities present in the crude oils of actual systems. The normally hydrophilic rock material of petroleum reservoirs, usually silica or limestone, may be greatly altered in nature, or even caused to become hydrophobic, through adsorption of basic or acidic polar impurities from the crude oil. Chemisorption of basic polar compounds appears to take place at acidic silica surfaces, whereas acidic polar compounds are chemisorbed at basic limestone surfaces. A preliminary study of the alteration of the hydrophilic rock material made by means of contact-angle determinations indicates that a thorough study of such alteration, using a series of oil-water systems which would give a wide range of measurable and reproducible interfacial contact angles, should throw much light on actual production problems.INTRODUCTIONConsidering briefly the various phases of petroleum engineering in which a knowledge of capillary and surface phenomena would prove useful, we may note first that the natural distribution of oil, gas, and water in the reservoirs depends at least in part on the relative degree of wetting of the reservoir rock by the various fluids present.1aTheories proposed to account for the migration and accumulation of petroleum include a consideration of the role of surface forces in bringing about movement of heterogeneous fluids through porous media.2,3In drilling practice, various problems of surface chemistry are encountered. Properties of drilling muds, such as the stability of the dispersed solids and the thixotropic nature of the mud, are dependent on the boundary tension which exists between the solid particles and the drilling fluids.4,5Numerous applications of surface chemistry are possible in considering the actual production of oil from the reservoir: the effective control of water drive, both artificial and natural;6the Jamin effect, both in oil-gas and oil-water systems;7,8the infiltration of drilling fluids into pay streaks;5the formation of a water sheath around the well bore, and many similar problems.9The acid treatment of oil wells and the breaking of oil-field emulsions are both phases of production in which a knowledge of surface forces is highly desirable. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss all these problems. It is our intention to discuss particularly those phases of production practice in which the degree of wetting of the reservoir rock material by oil, gas, and water is an important factor.Boundary TensionsIn oil and gas reservoirs a total of six interfaces is possible between the rock material, oil, gas, and water. They are:The rock-material-crude-oil interface.The rock-material-water interface.The rock-material-gas interface.The water-oil interface.The water-gas interface.The oil-gas interface.",,American Petroleum Institute

335,320890,,Multiple-Zone Completions,E.O. Bennett(Continental Oil Co.),,,,,,API-42-009,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"The author states that there are many fields throughout the United States that have two or more separate, and distinct hydrocarbon fluid-bearing strata in overlying positions; and that, for the application of best production practice and maximum ultimate recovery from such overlying formations in any pool, each should be treated the same as if it were a single-zone field or pool. Multiple-zone completions may be made with more than two zones producing simultaneously into the same well. The author discusses only two such formations, and the equipment designed for and limited to dual completions. The author states that dual-pumping wells may be placed in several classifications such as: 1, a single pump-and-packer installation where the formations above and below the packer are pumped intermittently by the same pump; 2, a double pump with single or double prime mover, where two zones are pumped simultaneously; 3, a single pump in one or two zones, with natural flow from the other; 4, the gas-lifting of two zones simultaneously; 5, the gas-lifting of either of two zones while the other is being pumped; 6, the pumping of one zone while gas is injected into the second; and, 7; the gas-lifting of one zone while gas is injected into the other. The author further cites the savings to be made in steel required, drilling time, and wear on drilling equipment; and states that, in certain strategic areas, dual completions permit the most oil to be recovered per ton of steel used, and that they help keep up allowable requirements.INTRODUCTIONThere are many oil fields throughout these United States that have two or more separate and distinct hydrocarbon fluid-bearing strata in overlying positions. For the application of best production practice and maximum ultimate recovery from such overlying formations in any pool, each should be treated the same as if it were a single-zone field or pool. By this is meant that an operator or producer should be able to control the production rates of fluids from each zone entirely independent of all others below or above it, and that he should at any time be able to obtain formation pressures and bottom-hole samples from each zone for analysis. Multiple-zone completions may be made with more than two zones producing simultaneously, into the same well. In this discussion only two such formations have been considered, and the equipment discussed has been designed for and limited to dual completions. The same principles and practices developed for dual completions may be applied to triple-zone completions. The production practice of opening several separate producing sands into a single well bore has caused, no doubt, great underground waste, and has left much oil ,irrecoverable. When two or more sands having pressures nearly alike produce simultaneously into the same well without separation, the more permeable section will produce at the greater rate. If such a sand produces water, it is obvious that it may partly or wholly drown out the well and leave much of the oil from the sand of low permeability irrecoverable, as water will move through the sand of high permeability under less pressure differential than oil through a sand of low permeability.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-42-018,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"This paper presents representative data on multiple-zone completions which have been made in the several oil-producing regions of the United States. It is a joint effort of the Topical Committees on Drilling and Production Practice, and constitutes a progress report on the subject. The desire of the oil industry to find ways and means of conserving steel in its drilling and production activities led to the decision to undertake this survey. An analysis of 89 multiple-zone completions indicates that an average per-well saving of 105 tons, or 46 per cent, was realized in a multiple-zone completion, in comparison with 2 standard well completions. Available information indicates that the initial completion of wells in more than one zone can be accomplished successfully. Reliable data on the effectiveness of the method are at present limited to the earlier stages of multiple-zone production. Sufficient representative data on the later life (especially during the artificial-lift period) of multiple-zone wells are not yet available to permit drawing any definite conclusions as to the ultimate overall practicability of the method. Existing conditions with respect to critical materials reasonably may be expected to result in an accelerated development of improved technique and more advanced methods of application.INTRODUCTIONAt the spring meeting of the Southwestern District of the Institute's Division of Production, in Dallas, Texas, in February 1942, a number of suggestions were advanced as to ways and means of producing more oil with less use of critical materials, it having been agreed unanimously that for the duration of the war all projects undertaken by the committees of the Southwestern District should be in direct support of the war effort. Prominent among these suggestions was a study of dual or multiple-zone completions; however, no decision was reached at that time as to the advisability of a paper on this subject. In the five months' period following the meeting a growing interest has been manifested in the subject due to the increasing scarcity of steel. In view of the wide interest exhibited, such a survey appeared to be warranted, inasmuch as the experience and data accumulated by operators having made multiple-zone completions were not available generally to the industry. Subsequently it was decided that the Topical Committees on Drilling and Production Practice jointly would undertake a statistical survey of data on multiple-zone completion practices as a contribution to the petroleum industry. The two committees prepared a questionnaire which was forwarded to all operators who have made multiple-zone completions. The executed questionnaires which were returned to the committees supplied the basic data used in this paper, which is to be considered as a progress report. It was not the purpose of this survey to investigate the merits of multiple-zone completions or to offer recommendations as to general applicability of the method. Instead, the objective of the study was to present basic data made available to the committees mainly from the viewpoint of methods, equipment employed, the initial degree of success achieved, and difficulties experienced. It may well be that the desire or necessity to expend the minimum amount of critical material will lead to wider adoption of multiple-zone completions where the method can be employed successfully.",,American Petroleum Institute

Chaney(Sun Oil Co.),,,,,,API-42-031,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"A general review of the colloidal chemistry of clays and shales is presented as a theoretical background for the explanation of the various mud problems, and for the chemical treatments used in their correction. Each of the common mud problems is discussed separately, and an attempt is made to provide a method of diagnosing the cause of trouble from changes in the physical properties of the mud. Following this diagnosis, one or more methods of treatment for correction of the trouble are described, and the theoretical explanation for the action of the corrective treatment is presented whenever possible. A table showing the combinations of mud properties, or symptoms associated with each type of trouble, together with an outline of the corrective treatment, is presented as an aid in rapidly deciding upon the cause of trouble and in selecting the proper treatment. It is urged that more effort be applied to determination of the cause of mud trouble. A careful study of the results of the various field mud tests is ordinarily sufficient to indicate the impurity producing trouble, and a method of treatment which eliminates this impurity will give better and more economical results than are obtainable by a trial-and-error treatment to improve certain physical properties of the mud.INTRODUCTIONIn recent years the technique of mud controls has made rapid advances. The research engineers of the oil industry, of the universities, and of the commercial mud and chemical companies have sought and found explanations for many of the peculiarities of mud behavior. Consequently they are able to predict more accurately than before the response of mud to various treatments and, in many cases, to avoid trouble as well as to correct it. Unfortunately, the field mud engineer often does not have the opportunity to study the literature and to perform the experiments .necessary to a practical field application of these new discoveries. Consequently there is a gap between the research departments and field practice which delays the advance in field mud-control technique. To the practical mud engineer, the research man often seems too theoretical, and to the research man, the field engineer seems unwilling to accept new ideas. However, it is necessary to efficient operation that these groups cooperate. In this paper an attempt is made to bridge this gap between laboratory and field practice. The ordinary mud troubles are considered, and an effort made to explain theoretically both the cause of the trouble and the effects of the corrective chemical treatment. The paper has been written primarily from a practical standpoint, and to the research engineer the theoretical phases probably will appear overly simplified. Most controversial points of theory have been omitted in order to avoid confusion, and only those theoretical explanations which, in the author's opinion, best seem to fit the facts are included. All methods of mud treatment suggested in the following pages have been used successfully and economically in the field. It is realized in presenting this paper that criticism will come from both research and field engineers, for the reason that a compromise between the two points of view has been attempted.",,American Petroleum Institute
338,320893,,Caliper Logging In The Southwest,C.P. Parsons(Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.),,,,,,API-42-047,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"The author states that caliper logging is a practice of measuring the actual variations in diameter of the open hole in a well. It rapidly is eliminating the guess work from oil-well cementing, packer settings, shooting, acidizing, gravel-packing, and many other practices and problems in drilling wells and producing wells. In addition it provides useful information in connection with the important problem of drill-pipe failures; and, as each sedimentary layer of earth reacts differently to erosion during drilling, a caliper log provides new physical markers for geological correlations. The logs which accompany he paper show the application of specific measurements to actual problems in the geographical area embraced by the Southwestern District of the American Petroleum Institute.IntroductionThe open hole in a well no longer is the blind spot of the oil fields. Before the introduction during the past year of caliper logging on an extensive scale, field men, engineers, and geologists constantly were groping in the dark with problems in which the physical size of the open hole was involved. Sometimes there were as many different mental pictures of the hole as there were men working on the well. Briefly, caliper logging is a practice of measuring the variations in diameter of the open hole. The writer has just presented a paper on caliper logging in general, but herein will discuss only some caliper logs from wells in the geographical area embraced by the Southwestern District of the American Petroleum Institute. Starting with the grass roots in a well to be drilled in the Gulf Coast, for instance, the first problem in which the diameter of the hole is involved is where to set surface casing. Several caliper logs taken in a field in southern Louisiana show that all the formations in the upper part of the wells wash out considerably; whereas below a certain depth the sands have a tendency to stand up to bit size, but the shales wash out. This transitional point appeared to be a logical depth to set surface pipe in that field, and it now is being done accordingly instead of being guessed at. The next problem is how much cement to place behind surface casing. Due to the hazard of blowouts from high-pressure gas frequently encountered in the Gulf Coast, the proper selection of depth to set surface casing and the proper amount of cement to place behind it become very important. At any moment during a blowout the surface casing may become the sole defense against cratering, the most destructive hazard in the oil fields. Besides successful prevention of cratering, it also may become necessary to attach an emergency connection to the top of the surface casing through which the wild well may be killed by pump pressure. It is obvious, therefore, that surface casing should be anchored as securely as possible in areas which produce high-pressure gas. The physical measurement obtained by caliper logging not only assists in determining the proper depth for setting surface casing, but it is the only way of determining how much cement will be required to fill the space behind the casing.",,American Petroleum Institute

McKeithan(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-42-057,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"The development of allocation methods in the various oil-producing states is reviewed and analyzed; also a brief description of the administration and mechanics of the systems employed is presented. Conclusions drawn there from are:The oil industry is operated primarily on a competitive basis, and this factor adds to the complexity of the attainment of maximum efficiency in conservation, and allocation is extremely difficult.Systems of control in the various states are geared to meet local operating conditions as well as background and temperament of the people in conformity with American standards of localized government.The actual mechanics of allocation used in the various states differ greatly and, further, it appears that one basic law or one rigid formula cannot be applied reasonably to all the varied conditions.Vast strides toward general improvement have been made in recent years; however, there is still room for considerable betterment; and the Standards of Allocation of Oil Production Within Pools and Among Pools, as Set Out in the report of the American Petroleum Institute's Special Study Committee on Well spacing and Allocation of Production, should be of material assistance in further progress.IntroductionConservation of petroleum is the prime objective in the control and restriction of oil and gas production. To attain the desired results, it is not only necessary to distribute production in a manner to permit the greatest Ultimate recovery, but also to limit current supply to consumptive requirements. The most difficult problem involved is the equitable distribution of restricted production to the various pools and wells within the respective states. This problem is aggravated at the present time because the reserves of many oil and gas fields are large enough to withstand Production rates in excess of consumptive demand and yet stay within the range of efficient and conservative operation. The term proration applies to the broad process of imposing restrictions on production, whereas allocation applies to the more specific procedure of distributing regulated production to wells and pools within a state. Proration is essential to the attainment of effective conservation, and, as such, is the principal instrument used in the prevention of waste and the promotion of good production practices. The need for proration has been demonstrated amply, and now is accepted widely as necessary to the general welfare. To meet this necessity a comprehensive plan of allocation is essential. However, only in recent years have the principles of allocation been developed from a scientific and engineering standpoint, and these principles have yet to be embodied firmly in the regulatory process. For this reason, proper allocation of production is the most important and commanding phase of the current proration problem. The economic aspects of proration are related too closely to the general problem to be overlooked in any successful allocation system. The discovery and production of oil and gas is not only a highly competitive business, but one of uncertain financial gain. Therefore, any restriction of production strikes directly at the very economics of operation. For this reason, it is of vital importance that full consideration be given the various economic factors in the overall problem of proration and allocation.",,American Petroleum Institute

The work of the various compact committees is described, and the conservation policies and administrative activities in the various oil-producing states are summarized.IntroductionThe term coordination has become popular in this national emergency which has required all of the nation's resources to be marshaled and thrown into a concentrated spearhead to defend our way of life. The oil industry, state authorities, and federal agencies have set up coordinating agencies to further the war effort. In fundamental principle, coordination is the basis of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission. The commission is not clothed with arbitrary power, but only with the right to coordinate existing agencies and authorities of power in all branches of government: state and interstate. The degree of success of the principle of coordination depends upon the degree of cooperation given by the states, by industry, and by interstate and governmental groups. The Interstate Oil Compact Commission has tendered its facilities to the President of the United States, to the Petroleum Administrator for War, and to other federal and state governmental agencies in the war effort. In order adequately to cover the work of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission in the coordination of conservation practices within the various states, it is necessary to look back to the period from 1925 to 1931 when overproduction problems were created by the unprecedented discoveries of vast productive fields such as Yates, East Texas, Seminole, and Oklahoma City. Statutes requiring purchasers of oil to buy ratably from the producers in a common pool were of doubtful constitutionality, and were never enforced effectively. The first real semblance of an interstate compact came at the request of the Secretary of the Interior; whereupon the governors of 10 of the oil-producing states appointed representatives to serve on the Oil States Advisory Committee. This committee met at intervals, and suggested to the producing states estimates of the reasonable market demand. This committee functioned until the period in which the petroleum code, created by the national recovery act, introduced the monthly allocation system based upon studies made by the Bureau of Mines. Since its inception in 1935, the Interstate Oil Compact Commission has adhered to the policy of prevention of waste in the production of oil and gas. The six charter states of Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado have now been augmented by the addition of Michigan, Arkansas, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. Since its organization the compact commission has reduced appreciably the initial antagonism and rivalries among the various states, and has brought instead a general feeling of free cooperation and an earnest desire to accomplish true conservation and the prevention of avoidable waste. The strength of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission lies in the fact that it has no power of compulsion. The member states voluntarily have joined the compact to cooperate with one another in the furtherance of a conservation program without surrendering their freedom in handling their own resources.",,American Petroleum Institute

Vitter Jr.(Harvard University.),,,,,,API-42-079,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"A method is proposed for the determination of back-pressure tests on gas-condensate wells. It is a modification of the regular back-pressure test conducted on low-pressure dry gas wells, as outlined inBureau of Mines Monograph 7.aA modification is required due to the presence of liquid in the well stream and the error in Weymouth's friction formula as noted by Miller. Determinations of sand-face pressures from well-head measurements are obtained from published data on densities of gases and pressure drop due to flow. Necessary precautions to be observed in making well-head measurements are outlined.INTRODUCTIONThe back-pressure test on gas wells is a result of the gas industry's search during the past decade for a reliable standardized method of determining the ability of gas wells to produce gas. Many people have contributed to its development, and a comprehensive report on the subject by Rawlins and Schellhardt1was made available 1936 with the publication ofBureau of Mines Mo7logrnpk 7: Back-Pressure Data on Natural-Gas Wells and their Application to Production Practices, which has become the standard guide and reference source on the subject. The method is basically sound in theory, and has been proved practical in actual use. However, all the original development of the method was done on wells which were of relatively low pressure and liquid hydrocarbon content. With the advent of the deep high-pressure gas-condensate wells, the method, without modification, could not be applied with any great reliability. A modified method, identical in general principle, is proposed. This method is discussed herein. The principle of the back-pressure test is that the general steady-state equation of flow of any gas well, is of the form:(mathematical equation available in full paper)The modified method assumes equation (1) to apply. The presence of liquid saturation in the reservoir has been shown by Rawlins and Schellhardt,1Leverett and Lewis2and others to change the effective permeability; but, as the change in amount of liquid saturation with reduced flowing pressures is approximately linear over the normal drawndown pressure range, and as the change in effective permeability is also approximately linear over this same range, it follows that one might expect the characteristic flow equation (1) of a gas-condensate well to have a smaller value of the exponent n and the coefficient C than it would have if it were a dry gas well. Difficulties arise in insuring stabilized flow in the well, and in determining sand-face pressures.Stabilization of Gas-Condensate WellsAs already mentioned, the general flow equation (1) of a gas well applies to the steady state, i.e., the well must be stabilized. In the simplest terms, sacrificing rigor for the sake of simplicity, a well is stabilized when both the rate of flow and well pressures individually become and remain constant. The reservoir itself, depending on its permeability, porosity, fluid content, and, configuration, requires a certain amount of time to set up stabilized flow. When the fluid gets into the well bore, if it is all gas it will flow up the tubing to the surface, and stabilized flow within the tubing will he established in a matter of a few minutes.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-42-088,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"The discovery of deeper reservoirs under higher pressures has resulted in the need for control equipment to preserve and protect these great sources of energy; also means of preventing freezing or the solidification of hydrates, caused by throttling or restricting production, are required. The development of a successful removable subsurface-pressure regulator has enabled operators to reduce dangerously high flowing pressures at the surface to safe working limits. By transferring the principal point of pressure reduction from the surface to warmer subsurface levels, complete elimination of the freezing conditions in flow lines can be accomplished. Development and operation of a subsurface regulator are described, and charts and tables for use in determining proper depths for pressure reductions to prevent freezing are shown. Other beneficial results, heretofore considered subordinate, such as the reduction and stabilization of gas-liquid ratios in condensate producing wells and the retardation of water encroachment, have been observed. The possibility of establishing conditions in the tubing string favorable to the precipitation of condensate through the use of subsurface regulators is suggested. Further technical research relating to the use of subsurface regulators for controlling temperatures and pressures in the flow string to obtain conditions most conducive to the precipitation and an increased recovery of condensate is desired.INTRODUCTIONEver since the discovery of the first reservoir containing oil and gas under relatively high pressure, operators have been confronted with freezing troubles in flow lines of wells caused by hydrocarbon hydrates that form as solids and accumulate on the downstream side of the surface controls on the wells and in restricted flow passages. As reduction in temperature as well as pressure is an influencing factor controlling the formation of these hydrates, the difficulties caused are more or less seasonal, and usually begin with the first cold weather in the fall of the year. The application of heat to the flow lines by means of hot-water heaters, which are troublesome and somewhat hazardous, remedied the earlier freezing difficulties, but was not an entirely satisfactory solution. The discovery of many deeper high-pressure oil and gas-producing reservoirs beginning in 1936, however, has brought higher pressures to the well head and has necessitated the use of stronger equipment and better methods for handling safely the greater pressure energy of such wells. The control of this energy and the protection of the well and the reservoir it taps, as well as the elimination of freezing caused by throttling the flow stream, present engineering problems of major importance today, and are likely to become more critical as exploration is continued and deeper petroleum deposits at higher pressures are found. A removable subsurface regulator was designed, primarily, to alleviate the difficulties caused by freezing of the conductor pipes and controls on high-pressure wells. The purpose of this paper is to explain the theory of its operation, to describe its construction, and to discuss the probable uses of subsurface regulators in the control of high-pressure wells in the future.",,American Petroleum Institute

He then discusses the complete design of the system, and gives data on five years' operation of several systems in the Mid Continent area.Unsought, unwanted, and unprofitable- the disposal of water incident to the production of oil and gas the most unpopular of all the scenes that the industry views as it travels the road from a likely place to drill to the retailing of the finished product. In the not too distant past there was a tendency to regard salt water as one of the unmentionables, something to hide, something to deny, something to be put out of sight and forgotten. However, in recent years disposal of salt water has been recognized as an expensive, difficult problem-a common foe to all operators, and worthy of their best concerted efforts. I shall not attempt to trace the evolution of saltwater disposal from the primitive means of letting the water run where it would, to the present practice of providing deep disposal with leakproof storage; nor shall I attempt to discuss the advisability of disposal or the legal technicalities connected with disposal-those features being in the province of the executive and legal departments-but shall limit myself to reporting the mechanics of the physical disposal of water as practiced by one major company. At the present time this company has in operation 194 disposal wells, 117 miles of salt-water gathering lines; It is the operator of 9 cooperative salt-water disposal associations, and a member of several associations operated by other companies. I do not presume to suggest, even by implication, that this company's method of disposal surpasses any other company's methods of handling water, or that any of the methods should be adopted by other companies. This company, I am sure, does not claim that it is the originator of any of the methods reported, but it is interesting to note that this company had a deep disposal well in operation as early as February 1925. I shall further limit this discussion to disposal in its strictest sense, Le., the injection of water into non-producing formations. I shall not consider solar or artificial evaporation, stream dilution, or repressuring by the injection of water into a producing formation. There are in existence some highly successful and profitable water floods in which produced salt water is used as a propulsive force to drive the oil through the producing sand but in these flooding projects due consideration was given to the number and location of the injection wells, to the controlled volume input and withdrawal, and to the execution 'of contracts which protect the rights of all parties having an interest in the field affected, prior to injection of water into the producing formation. Under such use, salt water becomes an asset instead of a liability. Such a plan should have first consideration, but repressuring with produced water should never be confused with disposal.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sage(California Institute of Technology),,,,,,API-42-162,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1942,"A method for the prediction of the enthalpy? of gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures is outlined. It utilizes the partial enthalpies of the components at the state in question. Some preliminary values of these quantities, based upon the behavior of binary systems, are tabulated. Results obtained by this method for two natural gases are compared with experimental values and with those obtained by use of other methods of prediction.Information concerning the enthalpy of hydrocarbon mixtures is of value in establishing the heat and work associated with the changes in state that accompany the production and refining of petroleum. At present direct experimental information relating to the subject is sparse, and frequently it becomes necessary to predict the enthalpy of a mixture from a knowledge of that mixture's composition and the prevailing pressure and temperature. This discussion deals with a method for predicting the enthalpy of gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures, and presents tentative data for use at temperatures between 100 and 250 deg F for pressures up to 3,000 psi. The enthalpy of the gas phase of pure substances has been estimated in a number of ways. Among these the proposals of Watson and Smith,1aEdmister,2and York and Weber3appear to have been of especial value to the petroleum industry. In general, these methods are predicated upon some form of the law of corresponding states, although deviations from this simple generalization are taken into account in most instances. Such correlations probably are as accurate for pure substances as are experimental values, except those based upon the best volumetric data, because a rather high degree of accuracy is required in the latter in order to obtain enthalpy values which are entirely suitable for engineering use. Strictly speaking, such properties of a mixture as enthalpy and specific volume are unique functions of the state of the system under consideration, but efforts have been made to correlate the behavior of mixtures with that of their components. Kay4has proposed the use of a pseudo-critical temperature and pressure, which would permit the direct application of the law of corresponding states as established for pure substances to mixtures. It was proposed that the pseudo-critical temperature and pressure bf the mixtures be established from the critical temperatures and pressures of the components in the following way:(mathematical equation available in full paper)If homogeneous mixtures follow exactly this modified law of corresponding states, the isothermal change in enthalpy with change in state will be a single-valued function of the initial and final reduced states. This would afford a simple way of predicting such change5in enthalpy for gaseous hydrocarbon mixtures. However, as rather small inaccuracies in volumetric data result in relatively large uncertainties in the isothermal changes in enthalpy, it is to be expected that the agreement of the enthalpies of mixtures predicted on this basis with those established by experiment would not be as good as for a similar comparison of volumetric behavior. If it is assumed that the gas phase is an ideal solution,6it follows that the enthalpy of any mixture may be ascertained from the enthalpies of the components in the same type of phase, and at the same temperature and pressure, from the following equation:(mathematical equation available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

All of the water-receding angles measured were less than 90 deg, whereas the majority of water-advancing angles were greater than 90 deg. It is shown that spontaneous displacement of oil by water occurred only when both angles were less than 90 deg. No spontaneous movement occurred when the angles were on opposite sides of 90 deg. Spontaneous displacement of water by oil would be expected if both angles were greater than 90 deg, but such a situation never was found. Probably the most significant fact brought out by the work was that so large a percentage of the oils gave advancing interfacial contact angles greater than 90 deg, indicating that the surface underlying the oil had become hydrophobic, probably by adsorption of surface-active materials from the crude oil. With such systems, a water drive might leave behind a large quantity of oil adhering to the siliceous material if too rapid a rate of drive were attempted, unless additions to the water of suitable materials for reducing the advancing- water angle could be made.INTRODUCTIONWhen petroleum IS produced from a reservoir, water frequently supplies, at least a part of the driving force which moves the oil toward the well bore. This driving force can be supplied by water in two ways: The hydrostatic head on the water underlying the oil in the reservoir accounts for the major part of the water-driving force, but another part may be the result of the tendency of the water to displace oil from the capillary rock formation. This latter displacement force acts favorably only in those cases in which water wets the rock formation to a higher degree than does the oil. It has been assumed tacitly, inasmuch as water is known to wet silica more highly than do many pure organic liquids, that all reservoir-rock formations are wetted to a higher degree by water than by crude oil. That this assumption does not hold true in some instances has been shown by recent work.1a,2,3,4It is, therefore, necessary to find out whether, or under what conditions, water wets a particular formation to a higher degree than does the oil of the formation, before it can be determined whether- the water drive is being utilized most effectively. Comparatively little reliable information is available regarding the relative degrees of wetting of reservoir-rock materials by different liquids. To designate the relative degrees of wetting in a series of liquids, it may be stated that the rock material is wetted the more highly by that liquid which causes the greater lowering of free surface energy when its liquid-air interface and a corresponding area of rock-material-air interface disappear to form an area of liquid-rock-material interface.",,American Petroleum Institute

Craze(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-43-009,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"This paper is directed to the practical interpretation and application of conclusions reached by the Special Study Committee and Legal Advisory Committee on Well Spacing and Allocation of Production of the American Petroleum Institute. Technologies classify oil field according to the dominant drive which expels oil from a reservoir as follow- 1, dissolved-gas drive, 2, gas-cap drive; 3, water drive. Significant characteristics and comparison of principal distinguishing features of these three types of drive are described and graphically illustrate by operating data on typical oil fields. Recognition of the type of field permits an operator to plan an intelligent development program and to exercise control over the behavior of the reservoir. Important factors governing of recovery are control of the rate of oil production and control of gas and water production. Modification of the drive may be accomplished by judicious injection of gas or water into a reservoir. Well spacing is considered in its integral relationship to development and operation of the whole field. Intelligent application of reservoir engineering to efficient and economic exploitation of oil fields requires effective cooperation of all operators, and acceptance and promotion of good operating practices.INTRODUCTIONThere no exists a well developed science of oil-reservoir engineering Present-day thought on the subject is best summarized in the bookStandards of Allocation of Oil Productionpublished in 1942 by the Special Study Committee and Legal Advisory Committee in Well Spacing and Allocation of Production of the American Petroleum Institute. The conclusions stated in this book were reached after years of study of all types of fields by competent technologists of wide and varied experience. The conclusion of this group form the foundation for this paper, which is not meant to be technical, but is directed to the practical interpretation and application of these conclusions. It is appreciated that the technical principles underlying the behavior of oil fields are universal, however, conditions and operating practices differ decidedly from one area to another. Accordingly, the examples cited in this paper have been restricted primarily to oil fields in the southwestern part of the United States.TYPES OF RESERVOIR DRIVE AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCEPartly for convenience, partly because such categories sometimes provide approximate rules of thumb for guidance and, finally, because the terms are descriptive and suggestive, technologists have classified oil fields according to the following categories :Dissolved-gas driveGas-cap driveWater drive.These are not meaningless phrases The worddriveis highly significant. It implies what often is over-looked, i.e., that oil lacks any inherent ability to expel itself from the sand or to flow into a well. It must be driven. The agent, gas or water, employed in the expulsion characterizes the drive. The question may well be raised as to whether these classifications have real or practical significance and, if they do, the conditions which determine the type of drive. The distinction is not academic. The type of drive fixes the operating characteristics and, to a large extent, determines the ultimate recovery.",,American Petroleum Institute
347,320902,,Efficient Rate Of Production,H.H. Kaveler(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-43-021,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The opportunity to produce oil and gas at controlled rates of production exists in periods of excess potential supply, and creates the engineering problem of determining the relationship between rate of production of a pool and ultimate recovery. Insofar as this problem is concerned, oil reservoirs may be likened in some respects to engines. Both operate by transforming energy from one form to another in a manner limited to less than theoretical efficiency by certain basic designs or structural features. The most efficient rate of producing a reservoir can never be attained experimentally, as each pool can be produced only once and opportunities do not exist to control and evaluate each of the many factors that affects the rate vs. recovery relationship. The determination of an efficient rate depends upon the character of the reservoir rock, its fluid content, and upon structural conditions in each pool. There are, nevertheless, sound basic engineering procedures now widely recognized and embodied in so-called reservoir-engineering art which serve as a guide in determining comparative degrees of efficient rate of production. These procedures involve classification of reservoirs as to type of drive, pressure-volume behavior of the reservoir rock measured mainly by its permeability to fluid flow. By more careful reservoir study, and from experiences gained from instances when control of rate greatly has improved reservoir performance, the industry is establishing criteria whereby the efficiency of rate of withdrawal as a factor in determining recovery may be judged in comparative degree. This paper outlines certain basic fundamental principles which, when followed, lead to increased efficiency of recovery by rate adjustment.DefinitionWhether an oil producer is familiar with the dictionary definition of the word efficient, he still comes to recognize and depend upon a quality of efficiency in men, machines, and the industrial process that represents the competitive enterprise in which he is engaged. The word is difficult to define, but as it applies to petroleum production, efficiency is a measure of accomplishment of a desired result is maximum recovery of the petroleum present in any pool consistent with reasonable or decreased cost of production-which means, generally, the elimination of waste in petroleum production. The standard of efficiency in any progressive industry is constantly raised to higher and higher levels as technical skill is improved under a system of competitive operation. Although it is usually easy to measure relative efficiency of an operation as between present and past times, it is difficult to choose and bring into practice new methods that promise improvement in the future. This is particularly true in petroleum-production practices. Oil reservoirs are developed and operated in a much more efficient manner today than they were even a few years ago. New techniques and new facts founded upon the application of scientific principles continue to improve production practices. Perhaps the most important contributions have come in recent years from the study of reservoir behavior and the influence of proper control of reservoir on the utilization of natural reservoir energy, whereby principles of petroleum engineering have been established that have stabilized the economy of the entire industry.",,American Petroleum Institute

Snow(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-43-028,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The most important objectives sought for any field are: 1, maximum ultimate yield; 2, maximum production rate per well at minimum cost per barrel To attain these objectives, control of reservoir pressure is a factor of greatest importance. For this purpose, a method for maintaining original reservoir pressure by Increasing the natural water drive was devised and is being practiced in the Midway Field, Arkansas. So far as known, this is the first Instance in which injection of extraneous water has been applied to an entire pool-and In the very early stages of its productive life. This method should be applicable to many other newly discovered or partly depleted oil pools where a deficiency of natural water drive can be recognized or where reservoir conditions are such that artificial water drive could be applied. Data from Midway Field, Arkansas, are presented which demonstrate a certain degree of control over pressure behavior In a large part of the reservoir by means of fresh-water injection. Reservoir pressures were increased in an area one mile in diameter during a period when withdrawals from the pool as a whole were considerably Increased. Over the five-month period following initial injection, the average reservoir pressure for the entire field declined at a negligible rate, whereas until that time the average reservoir pressure had fallen at the rate of approximately 1/2 psi per day Construction of permanent facilities to inject the required volume of water into four Input wells is under way In accordance water terms of an agreement between the operators in the field. The investment cost of the project, including the salt-water disposal system, will total approximately one-tenth of the development cost of the field.INTRODUCTIONRecognition by the Industry the advantages of water drive at maximum reservoir pressure has resulted from considerable research and many years of practical study of reservoir behavior It has been advocated that production under effective water drive be accepted as the engineering and conservation standard to be achieved and, further, that the rate of production for each pool should be restricted so as to permit the water drive to be effective.1aThere is little doubt that the majority of oil pools have had some degree of water drive in the Bartlesville sand in northeastern Oklahoma it was found that pools having the best water drives were located nearest the outcrop from which a certain amount of recharging water could have entered and in areas known to be connected effectively with large unbroken volumes of water-bearing reservoir2Many pools depend upon the expansion of water in major sand bodies to supply influx for natural water drive Examination of geological conditions shows that water influx often is seriously limited, and explains why some pools have had only partial water drives In the Oklahoma City Wilcox Pool it is reported4that 509 million barrels of Pore space, representing only 41 7 Per cent of the reservoir, was Permeated by water by July 1, 1940, and since that time water influx has continued at a greatly reduced rate Less than 20,000 bbl of water Per day has been produced since April 193% with no rise in water level.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lawry(Forest Producing Corp.),,,,,,API-43-035,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The author discusses his company's water-flood operations in the Mid Continent area, and states that his company reverts to pumping only if it is impossible to flow the secondary production to the surface. He states further that, although some shortcomings may be attributed to this operation, he is confident as much oil is obtained by this producing means as would be obtained by pumping-despite the fact that the experience of other operators has been less encouraging. The author states that delayed drilling of the producing wells can be considered a primary departure from conventional operations in connection with flowing, the second departure consisting of cementing the tubing on a packer in the oil wells. Almost all water-intake wells are cemented m with packers as a matter of good operation, but this is seldom the case with oil wells. The author then discusses the advantages of flowing over pumping-stating that the first advantage is simplicity of operation, In that the same pressure plant which puts the water into the ground is used to lift the oil out, thereby simplifying the manpower problem as well as the equipment of the entire property.IntroductionPerhaps the most controversial point among water-flood operators today is whether to pump or to flow their production because flowing is the newer and less understood of the two methods, a study of flowing and a comparison of flowing with pumping are desirable because of the increased attention being given to water-flooding operations. Flowing water-flood production involves the utilization of part of the energy of the injection or flooding water to lift the oil and/or water produced from the oil well naturally rather than by means of mechanical pumping equipment in flowing, therefore, practically no production is obtained until the sand body is saturated with fluid and is under hydraulic control. All reference to flowing in this paper means that act of production whereby the oil and water produced at the oil well are brought to the surface by the energy earned through the formation by the injection water from the intake well to the bore of the oil well of course, any water flood under pressure above hydrostatic will flow, If this pressure is permitted to continue until the oil wells are full, but for the most part this is considered a nuisance rather than an easier way to get oil and water out of the sand If the operator goes to the trouble of running a string of tubing and rods m the oil well, he does not want the well to remain unpumped long enough for it to fill up Flowing is not an innovation m the Mid Continent water-flood area Many of the earlier floods in the Bradford Field in Pennsylvania were experimented with in an attempt to avoid some of the high lifting costs prevalent m the Pennsylvania field. But, for reasons both obvious and obscure, the experiments with flowing in Pennsylvania were not considered successful, and that mode of production was considered a failure as far as water flooding was concerned.",,American Petroleum Institute

Noble(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-43-043,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The Katy Gas Field, located principally in Waller County, Texas, is the site of one of the world's largest gas cycling-plant installations. The plant is designed to process 275 million cubic feet of gas per day and to reo cover 80 per cent of the potential butanes and essentially all of the pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, such hydrocarbons to be utilized in the manufacture of aviation gasoline, rubber, toluene, and other products. This article describes the method of handling the high-pressure gas from the producing wells and its return to the injection wells, the facilities for supplying gas to the sales gas systems, and other plant operating features. The utilization of high-pressure steam (600 psi) for the turbogenerator unit and the steam and electric balance for pumps and process units are of particular interest in view of their application in gas cycling-plant operations.INTRODUCTIONThe Katy Gas Field, located approximately 40 miles due west of Houston, Texas, is situated principally in the southeastern corner of Waller County, with its outer limits extending into the southwestern corner of Harris County and the northeastern corner of Fort Bend County. In 1939 negotiations were begun with the parties having interests in the Katy Gas Field for the unitization of their properties, with the view of installing a cycling plant to process the produced gas for the recovery of desired liquid hydrocarbons and reinjection of the unsold residue gas Into the producing sands for the purpose of gas conservation Agreements of Interested parties regarding basic contracts for the project operation were completed by May 1941 After completion of these basic contracts, immediate plans were drawn for the installation of a gas cycling plant, the purpose of which, in addition to the foregoing operations, is to recover the essential products of butanes, gasoline, and other hydrocarbon fractions to be utilized m the manufacture of aviation gasoline, rubber, toluene, and other products. It might be of particular interest to discuss briefly some of the features of the plant design and operations as they relate to methods employed in handing the high-pressure gas, extracting the desired butanes, processing gas for gas sales, the unusual arrangement and operation of the steam system, and other design features.Plant DesignRecent trends In the design of most gas cycling plants have been toward the installation of plants with large gas-processing capacity, usually 100 to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day considerable study was given to the proper size plant to produce the Katy Gas Field, and It was concluded that a plant of the Oil-absorption type, with a processing capacity of 275 million cubic feet of gas per day, would permit economical processing of the gas over a period of 30 to 40 years The plant is designed to process 275 million cubic feet per day of gas from the producing wells, recovering 80 per cent of the potential butanes and practically all pentane and heavier hydrocarbons. Approximately 235 million cubic feet per day of wet gas will enter the 4 high-pressure absorbers operating at 1,800 psi.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sage(Sinclair Prairie Oil Co.),,,,,,API-43-052,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"Glenn Pool was the first major oil pool in Oklahoma. Original development took place mainly during 1906-1909. Peak production has been reported as 117,400 bbl per day m June 1907. The southern portion of the pool, covering 8,100 acres, is the most prolific sector. The North Extension area covers 8,400 acres. Oil-production and well-completion records for early years are very incomplete. However, it is believed that the southern sector has recovered at least 25,000 bbl per acre to date, whereas recovery from North Extension has been about 4,000 bbl, with total for entire reservoir in the order of 222 to 236 million barrels. The reservoir is of the gas-expansion type, and the southern, sector contains an unusually thick section of oil sand. Systematic gas-repressuring or gas-drive operations were started m May 1940, and very successful results obtained. By April 1, 1943 the repressure effort had been expanded to cover work done by 7 companies on 18 leases, with a total of 2,000 acres partly under repressure operation. A total of 308 old oil wells are being affected, and 51 new oil wells and 65 new input wells have been drilled. The production of these projects was 714 bbl per day before repressuring. During March 1943 the average production was 1,983 bbl per day, or an increase of 1,269 bbl An average of 1.42 tons of steel, In the majority consisting of second-hand lightweight casing, was used per barrel per day of increased oil rate. The procedures used in the drilling, coring, and completion of the wells are described, and method of gas injection and metering is discussed. A generalized isopach map and average core data are given. Further gas repressuring work is continuing.1. Geological ConditionsThe principal oil-producing horizon at Glenn Pool is the Bartlesville sand, locally designated as the Glenn Sand. Other formations which have produced minor amounts m small localized areas within the pool are the Red Fork, Taneha, Dutcher (mostly gas), and Wlicox sands. The accumulation of oil at Glenn Pool, in broad viewpoint, is due to the Glenn sand thinning or pinching out updip into shale to the east and north. This wedge or pinch-out formed a stratigraphic trap, the detailed nature of which has been discussed by Wilson However, within the extent of the trap itself there is one large area which contained a greater thickness of sand which was cleaner and of greater permeability and porosity. This more prolific oil-productive area, the northwest part of T 17N-R 12E, is located approximately midway between the pinch-out to the northeast and the occurrence of edge water downdip to the southwest, and commonly is designated as Glenn Pool Northward, the thickness of clean oil sand and the permeability and porosity become less, and that producing area (the southwest portion of T 18N-R 12E) usually is designated as North Extension Actually Glenn Pool and North Extension are one common reservoir. The Situation is shown by the Isopach map of the pool and the surrounding territory (Fig 1) The isopachs are constructed on the basis of total thickness of Glenn sand from top to base.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sherbone(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-43-066,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The variables affecting the radial-flow formula are discussed quantitatively. The importance of reservoir viscosity of oil is shown to be equal to that of sand permeability itself in determining flow. A modified specific productivity-index function is developed which bears a simple theoretical relationship to sand permeability. Pertinent data are tabulated on 141 California oil wells on which thorough core-analysis and productivity-index data were available. The modified specific productivity index function is studied graphically for these wells. The conclusion is reached that, although the well behavior for high-permeability sands approximates the theoretical, there is an increasing deviation between actual performance and theoretical with decreasing permeability. The spread of individual well performance from the average CaliforniaSPI-kcurve may be accounted for by deviations between air and water permeabilities, variable spread of permeability values, by varying stages of reservoir depletion, and by varying efficacy of well completion. It is expected that these variables will be studied further as more data become available.During the past several years attention has been focused with increasing intensity upon the problems involved in the flow of oil, gas, and water in the porous media which comprise our oil pools. It matters little whether the petroleum engineer is concerned with problems relating to well spacing, increasing potential production, increasing ultimate recovery or, in fact, almost any problem involving production from a petroleum reservoir; finally he is confronted by an inadequate amount of information pertaining to the mechanics of flow in the reservoir. This arises not from the scarcity of information which has been published In the field, for since the original work of Darcy5ain 1856 and the noteworthy contributions of King and Slichter18in 1899, many hydrologists and physicists and, in recent years, many petroleum engineers have investigated fluid flow in porous media Instead, the difficulty arises from the fact that by far the greater part of the work has been confined to homogeneous flow, whereas only a few Investigators have published material relative to heterogeneous flow in porous media. Experimental work with heterogeneous systems is difficult to perform, and to date it has not been found practicable to institute routine permeability measurements involving heterogeneous flow. For these reasons it has been found necessary to attempt to relate information obtained, for the most part, from homogeneous flow studies to the actual behavior of wells and reservoirs the present-day efforts to evaluate reservoir behavior fall, primarily, into two classes:The application of Darcy's law for homogeneous flow, with modifications for the heterogeneity of the system and with suitable adjustments for variations in the condition of the fluid occurring during the flow processThe empirical correlation of well productivity indices with homogeneous-fluid permeabilities.Although this paper is primarily concerned with the second method of evaluating well performance, it can be shown that both methods are closely related and that the factors which are influential in one method are also equally effective in the other. For this reason it is deemed advisable to discuss briefly these factors before discussing the empirical relationship studied by the writers.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dimit(Tide Water Associated Oil Co),,,,,,API-43-082,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"Operators in the East Texas Field with leases increasing in water production are continually adjusting their operations and venturing remedial work in an attempt to obtain the maximum ultimate recovery from their respective leases. The plastic in use since November 1942 is similar to bakelite, and changes from a liquid into a solid by application of heat. One of the most important properties of the liquid plastic is its ability to penetrate the formation, thus obtaining better bonding and more efficient water shutoff than cement as previously used. Success of plastic jobs is increasing each month as operators take advantage of experience gamed by the service company's personnel. It must, however, be borne In mind that numerous wells are still neither cleaned out nor logged before the plastic is placed, leaving the service company only small possibility of successful recompletion. With the progress made in developing new plastics with entirely different characteristics, new types of selective completions and squeeze jobs may be the next step in use of plastics in oil wells.In the East Texas Field, due to state and federal regulations, the per-well allowable has been increased on many wells involving a number of leases where salt water is being produced with the oil. The increase m per-well allowable on leases making salt water is brought about by the following regulations a, limiting of artificial-lift equipment to 1 well to 10 acres, b, transfer of allowables from large-volume water wells, c, earned salt-water allowables, 1e, 1 bbl of oil per 50 bbl of water injected. The increased well allowables under these circumstances have caused an increase m the water production from the remaining producing wells. Operators with leases m this category are continually adjusting their operations and venturing remedial work m an attempt to obtain the maximum ultimate recovery from their respective leases. Several papers have been given on methods and results of plugging back with cement during the life of the East Texas Field The five principal methods recognized with the use of cement are as follows.1,2aDump bailerDisplacementBradenhead squeezeShort-string squeezeRetainer squeezeConsensus of opinion on cement plug-back Jobs is that more successful Jobs on the sand sections are obtained where there is a shale break between the oil- and water-bearing sands. Since November 1942 plastics have been used to plug off water m wells m the East Texas Field, using only the dump-bailer method.Properties of PlasticThe plastic which is now being used is similar to bakelite, and is a clear amber liquid containing no undissolved nor suspended particles. This particular plastic has the property of changing from a liquid into a solid by the application of heat.

356,320909,,Counterbalancing Of Oil-Well Pumping Machines,Emory N. Kemler(Purdue University),,,,,,API-43-087,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The subject of counterbalance, although always of general interest, has become more important with the necessity of conserving materials, equipment, and labor. This paper discusses possible codes for field men and engineers. The code for field men as proposed has been prepared with the view of obtaining comments and suggestions of operators and manufacturers. It has been made entirely non-technical, and outlines methods the field men could use to check whether a well is properly counterbalanced. The section for engineers contains a proposed code on methods of making counterbalance calculations. This is intended to be a guide for engineers who have such problems to solve. The methods given apply to central powers as well as individual pumping units.INTRODUCTIONThis paper is the outgrowth of a suggestion to the Subcommittee on the Rating of Speed Reducers that a code on counterbalancing be prepared. The general subject of counterbalancing is so broad that it is difficult to outline such a code. It can be prepared for the operator or the engineer, it can point to out why proper counterbalance should be used or how to determine the amount to be used, and it can be reduced to empirical rules or given in mathematical form. The many comments and suggestions offered have been divided on just what a code should contain. This paper attempts to incorporate the many excellent suggestions which have been made in reply to a questionnaire sent out by the American Petroleum Institute. Some of the technical aspects have been discussed in detail in the literature Many abstracts have been made from a recent series of articles appearing inThe Oil Weekly,1aand also from suggestions made in the questionnaire. Perhaps one of the most serious difficulties with getting people interested in counterbalancing 1s the lack of specific evidence on the nature of damage that results from improper counterbalance. If the operator of the equipment is to be convinced of the necessity of proper counterbalance, he must be presented with pictures of equipment that failed because of improper counterbalance, a demonstration of the difference in operation of proper and improperly counterbalanced equipment, a comparison of costs of new equipment for a particular job when proper counterbalance can be depended upon and when it is known proper care in counterbalancing will not be used and, finally, some cost data from company records on the effects of improper counterbalance on operating costs. The foregoing data are not generally available. In my opinion it would be very effective in getting management, field men, and engineers interested in this important problem. To those who are not technically trained, figures on torque, effective load, stresses, etc, have little meaning unless expressed in terms of cost, failure, or trouble. A sound movie showing the effects of improper counterbalance and illustrating how properly to counterbalance wells would do much more than any code to get something done about counterbalancing. Manufacturers and operators should give serious consideration to the possibility of making such a movie.",,American Petroleum Institute

Stearns(University of Oklahoma),,,,,,API-43-108,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"A description is given of the experimental apparatus and methods used for studying the effect of various well and fluid conditions, pump design features, and operating practices upon the volumetric efficiency of sucker-rod pumps in oil wells. Factors investigated over a range of pumping speeds from about 9.5 spm to about 24 spm include the following.Valve spacing.Well depth, or pressure above pump plunger.Pump submergence.Temperature of oil.Vapor pressure of oil.Viscosity of oil.Size of gas anchor.Size of standing valve.The testing consisted of isolating, as nearly as possible, one variable at a time and measuring the volumetric efficiency of the pump for various values of the one variable while other controllable factors were held constant. In this way, the effect of each variable upon pump performance was evaluated. Because of the interrelation of certain factors such as temperature, viscosity, and vapor pressure of the oil, complete isolation of each variable was impossible. Nevertheless, much of the Information obtained, such as records of pressure changes above and below the standing valve during a pumping cycle, is of value, as it furnishes a broader foundation for the analysis of conditions within and adjacent to the pump. In general, it was found that none of the factors studied had an appreciable influence upon the efficiency of a pump when oil of relatively low vapor pressure was handled. However, when this type of oil was used, there was a noticeable reduction in efficiency due to increased oil temperature and also due to increased well depth. Both of these effects were attributed to increased slippage by the plunger in the first case because of lower oil viscosity at higher temperatures; In the second case because of greater differential pressure operating to force more oil by the plunger. Considerable reduction in efficiency was obtained only by using oil of higher vapor pressure. In this connection, It was found that when the vapor pressure of the oil appreciably exceeded the submergence pressure on the pump, the efficiency declined very markedly, and gas-locking of the pump resulted with a slight additional increase in oil vapor pressure or decrease in pump submergence pressure. The test results emphasize the Importance of maintaining a maximum submergence pressure on a sucker-rod pump, particularly if the fluid level above the pump is sufficiently low that the head it exerts does not appreciably exceed the vapor pressure of the oil. The test results also suggest the desirability (when dealing with wells of low fluid level) of taking steps, if possible, to lower the vapor pressure of the oil before it enters the pump. The next phase of this study will consist of measuring the effect of various factors upon slippage past a pump plunger.INTRODUCTIONThe volumetric efficiency of an oil-well pump may be defined as the ratio of the volume of stock-tank crude oil pumped to the volume of the pump displacement for the same period of time In this report volumetric efficiency is based upon actual plunger travel rather than polished-rod travel.",,American Petroleum Institute

The industry was well prepared with reserves and producing capacity to meet this unforeseen draft, but important adjustments in its transportation and refining branches were necessitated- the first by removal of tankships from Gulf to Atlantic Seaboard service, and the latter by the great special demands for aviation fuels, toluene, and synthetic rubber. Transportation is the vital link between demand and supply. The statistical record of demand and supply of petroleum shows the interdependence of the heavy consuming districts of the eastern United States (District 1) and the producing and refining centers of the South-west (District 3) between which-over many years- the traffic had grown to a 1941 daily average of more than 1,500,000 bbl. Just before the war, 96 per cent of this movement was made by tankship, but after Pearl Harbor unprecedented substitution and development of other carriers became necessary. This paper is a review of the industry?s accomplishments in transportation, which may be truly called oil's transportation miracle . Most of the material has already appeared in publications and reports by other authors, and the writer regrets that only a summary report can be presented. Moreover, because of the need for military secrecy, he cannot disclose certain phases of the problem or statistical data supporting others.Demand and Supply for Crude Petroleum and Its ProductsPrewar EraGeographically, the eastern states and the Lakes region are the areas of greatest petroleum-products consumption because of their dense population and their great industrial development. In 1941-although the effects of the European conflict were already apparent the annual consumption in eastern United States alone reached 550,000,000 bbl, or an annual average of 1,525,000 bbl per day. The indigenous oil production of this district was only about 85,000 bbl daily, so that more than 1,450,000 bbl had to be obtained elsewhere The Southwest as a whole supplies 2,000,000 bbl per day, or more than 50 per cent of the nation's oil production. Moreover, It has 14,000,000,000 bbl, or 69 7 per cent of the nation's known oil reserves Texas alone, with a daily production of about 1,400,000 bbl, has estimated reserves of 11,500,000,000 bbl. On the other hand, this district has an internal dally demand-excluding offshore movements-of only 500,000 bbl, leaving a dally surplus of more than 1,500,000 bbl available for other districts and export because of the low cost of tankship movement from Gulf ports to the Atlantic Seaboard, and the complementary position of these two districts as to demand and supply, It was quite natural that a great flow of Oil traffic-principally via tankship-developed between them. Production and demand for petroleum in the Mid Continent and m North Central United States (District 2) were almost equal in 1941, which would suggest that this district was in balance. However, District 2 normally exports products to other districts and, in return, receives Imports of crude and some products from Districts 3 and 4. Before the war it even received some refined products by pipe line from District 1, these having reached the East Coast by tankship either in the form of crude or products",,American Petroleum Institute

Somerton(University of California),,,,,,API-43-145,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1943,"The foaming properties of crude petroleum have received but little consideration in the past. Inasmuch as foam conditions are encountered in many phases of production and refining processes, a study of foaming tendency and foam stability was deemed essential to a further understanding of certain of these processes. Methods of measuring these important properties and of expressing the results of such measurements in readily comparable units have been developed, and are fully discussed. The results were analyzed further to determine the influence of other physical properties of the crude-oil-gas foam systems on their foaming properties. Stability was found to be determined by the viscosity of the crude alone, whereas the tendency to foam appears to be more a function of the composition of the system.INTRODUCTIONRapid developments in petroleum technology in recent years have opened many new fields for study and research in any investigation of oil and gas separators, oil-well pumps, gas anchors, or any other device or process in which a foam condition may Influence the efficiency and effectiveness of operation, a measure of the foaming characteristics of crude petroleum should prove of value. For example, the design of oil and gas separators m the past has been based principally on experience, whereas the modern trend in engineering design is toward the utilization of basic physical laws and sound engineering principles. Thus, the first factor to be considered in the design of oil and gas separators logically should be the character of the substance to be dealt with, ie, the stability of the gas-cut oil or foam Again, a study of the tendency of a crude-oil-gas system, of a particular zone or field, to foam may influence the type and size of the pumping installation to be employed Other possible applications of a measure of foaming characteristics are numerous a parallel exists between the concept of emulsions and that of foams. Foams, like emulsions, are commonly regarded as three-component systems, for they require for their formation not only a liquid phase and a gaseous phase, but also a third substance generally known as a foaming agent. As In emulsions, this third substance in crude-oil foams is probably a constituent of the crude itself. Thus, the chemical composition of the system is a determining factor in the tendency of a crude to foam and m the stability of such a foam after its formation. The physical properties of the system, such as viscosity, gravity, and surface tension, influence its foaming characteristics. It is not, however, the intent of this work to determine quantitatively their influence, for, undoubtedly, many other factors would need to be considered m a determination of foaminess from an analysis of such physical and chemical properties. Rather, the methods employed were based on the assumption that the foaming tendency and stability of a particular system are characteristic to that system, and are themselves physical properties of the system.Review of Previous WorkTo date very little information has appeared in the literature regarding the investigation of crude-oil foams.",,American Petroleum Institute

Tutschulte(Tide Water Associated Oil Co.),,,,,,API-44-040,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1944,"The authors present a summary of the development and production history of the Porler zone, Aliso Canyon Field. The Porter reservoir, which is wholly controlled by the Tide Water Associated Oil Company, has a present proved areal extent of about 150 acres. The structure in which the oil has accumulated is of unusual complexity, as the oil is found in sediments overridden by the Santa Susana thrust fault, with surface and sub. surface structure exhibiting no relationship. Development of the field has been influenced primarily by the rugged surface topography and unusual hardness of sediments which have rendered drilling more expensive than general California experience would suggest, and by the rapid lateral gradation of oil-bearing sediments which, together with the hidden type of structure, has rendered drilling more than ordinarily hazardous. The oil gravity, the producing gas-oil ratio, the formation pressure, and the formation temperature are all lower than is common in southern California fields of comparable depth. It is believed that the oil is being displaced from the reservoir by a combination dissolved-gas drive and partial water drive. In the production of the reservoir the primary objective has been to secure a maximum utilization of reservoir energy by varying withdrawals on the basis of the reservoir-pressure pattern.INTRODUCTIONThe Aliso Canyon oil field is located about 30 miles northwest from the center of the city of Los Angeles or about 6 miles northeast from the town of Chatsworth in the range of hills, the Santa Susana Mountains, which form the northerly boundary of the San Fernando Valley. More Precisely, the field is located in projected Sect. ,27 and 28, T 3-N, R 16-W, San Bernardino Base and Meridian. The discovery well, Tide Water Associated Oil Company's Porter No.1, was completed flowing on October 25, 1938. The highest daily net production from Porter No.1 was on November 1, 1938, when the well flowed 1,175 bbl of 23.9-API-gravity oil together with 213 MCF gas. Specific attention is directed to the gas-oil ratio of less than 200 exhibited by this first well, as it is an illuminating index of reservoir conditions later to be discussed. Porter No.1 was completed at an effective depth of 5,365 ft, with the interval from 4,795 ft to 5,365 ft open to production. The reservoir in which Porter No.1 was completed is called the Porter zone, and has since been proved to be wholly controlled by the Tide Water Associated Oil Company. Since the completion of Porter No. 1 further exploratory work has disclosed the existence of a deeper distinct reservoir, the Sesnon zone. The present paper, however, will be confined exclusively to a discussion of the Porter reservoir. The development of the Porter zone has resulted in the drilling of 18 wells during the past 5-year period. The reservoir has a presently proven areal extent of about 150 acres, with an arithmetic average drilled sand thickness of about 160 ft.PART IDEVELOPMENTTopographyOne of the distinguishing features of the Aliso Canyon Field is the extremely rugged topography which prevails.",,American Petroleum Institute
361,320914,,Reservoir Performance,J.J. Mullane(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-44-053,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1944,"It is shown that there are 3 fundamental types of performance or recovery mechanisms by which petroleum reservoirs may be operated, viz.: 1, dissolved-gas drive, in which only the energy due to the gas dissolved in the oil is utilized to produce oil; 2, gas-cap drive, in which displacement of oil is effected by an expanding gas cap, coupled with gravitational segregation of oil and gas; and, 3, water drive, in which displacement of oil is effected by the controlled encroachment of water. Of these methods, the latter two are the most efficient types of operation and, by means of these, the highest recoveries of oil from reservoirs can be obtained. The characteristics of each type of performance are described and illustrated by means of actual field examples. Particular attention is directed to the importance of early identification of the type of drive to be employed as the recovery mechanism in a petroleum reservoir and it is stressed that the dissolved-gas-drive mechanism is to be avoided whenever possible. The use of geologic and engineering data to make this distinction is illustrated. The proper control of producing rates, and gas and water production as factors of reservoir performance, are discussed; and a number of examples of the application of modern engineering principles to problems of these types are given. The subordinate role played by well spacing in the modern concept of reservoir performance is discussed. The particular point stressed is that well spacing alone is not the controlling influence on recovery efficiency; it is the control of the reservoir as a whole, in such a way that the most efficient mechanism of recovery is properly utilized, that governs the recovery to be obtained. Specifically, in any field, a sufficient number of wells should be drilled so that, when the field as a whole is produced at all efficient rate, the rate of production of individual wells is not excessive; i.e., individual wells should not be produced at such rates that there is an excessive production of free gas or water, or that the rate of depletion of the sand in the neighborhood of the wells is materially, greater than in the remainder of the reservoir.INTRODUCTIONThe necessity and desirability of operating petroleum reservoirs at the maximum efficiency practicable have occasioned the development of the growing science of reservoir engineering. The proper development and control of oil reservoirs form the subject matter of this field of study. During recent years the work of a number of petroleum technologists has resulted in the establishment of certain basic principles, upon which modern thought on oil reservoir performance is based. It is the purpose of this paper to present these principles and to show, by actual examples, how they may be effectively utilized.Reservoir PerformanceThree definite modes of performance of petroleum reservoirs have been recognized: 1, dissolved-gas drive; 2, gas-cap drive; and, 3, water drive. These are defined according to the source of energy, or drive, under which the oil is moved through the producing formation into the well.",,American Petroleum Institute
362,320915,,Review Of A Successful Water-Flooding Operation In Eastern Kansas,R.C. Earlougher(Geologic Standards Co.),,,,,,API-44-072,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1944,"The author reviews the development operations and control in use on 3 adjoining leases representing more than 200 flood acres in eastern Kansas where water-flooding operations are used to produce oil at a depth of approximately 700 ft from the Bartlesville sand. It is stated that the earlier operations were developed with but few engineering data and control, whereas considerable engineering data and control were used in later operations. Detailed data are shown, including estimates on possible increases in production expected by the use of improved methods. The author states that these operations have proved water flooding to be economically possible on those shallow leases which have the necessary favorable conditions of oil saturation and floodability at the inception of the work, and that ultimate recoveries may vary widely because of differences in development and operating methods.INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to report on certain water-flooding operations now in progress on a group of leases in eastern Kansas. The literature contains many articles on water flooding; however, a large number of these deal either in generalities or with certain technical or theoretical phases of secondary recovery. The main subject of this paper, on the other hand, is limited, to one successful operation in the hope that the factual data may be of benefit as a guide to new operations in other areas. Admittedly, methods that proved successful in one local area may not be adaptable to all other areas; on the other hand, basic principles are generally the same. The particular water-flooding operation covered by this paper was chosen for two specific reasons: 1, that the operations are successful; 2, that a large amount of detailed data is available for the operations. In addition to these prime factors this project is of interest because of the changes and advancements that have taken place as a result of experience gained in the field. Release of these data has been made possible by the cooperation of H. J. Walter, independent oil operator of Bradford, Pa., a partner in the company of Lynde, Walter and Darby; manager of operations, D. P. Oak; and field superintendent, J. O. Couch.LocationLynde, Walter and Darby's flooding operations are located in Neosho County, Kansas, just east of the town of Chanute. Flooding operations to date have been carried on in Sect. 22 and 15, township 27 south, range 18 east.Producing FormationThe producing formation is the Bartlesville sand occurring at a depth of approximately 700 ft. The sand is a typical eastern Kansas shoestring, varying in width from 1,000 ft to 2,500 ft and extending several miles in length. The sand grains are composed for the most part of quartz, with the cementing material carrying considerable quantities of shale. The sand section rarely occurs as a solid sand body, but contains numerous shale laminations and shale breaks varying in thickness from less than 1 in. to several feet. In general, these shale breaks cannot be correlated from well to well.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lahee(Sun Oil Co.),,,,,,API-44-215,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1944,"The author states that a growing need has been felt in recent years for a more precise terminology and a standardized classification in connection with the compilation and reporting of data pertaining to exploratory drilling and to oil reserves. He presents, for general adoption, a classification of exploratory drilling ; and he suggests for study and possible acceptance a classification of oil reserves. The former has been very carefully considered and has had wide approval among many geologists, engineers, and other members of the industry. The latter, which offers much less difficulty than the former, is believed to be logical and suitable for practical use.During the past several years, and especially in the past two years, the need for more precise definition of terms used in connection with the statistics of wildcatting and of crude-oil reserves has become increasingly evident. There has been so much variation in the conception of the significance of the terms wildcat and semi-wildcat, as previously used, that considerable discrepancies have resulted in statistics compiled by different persons or different organizations covering the same districts and the same dates. This has led to confusion in appraising the drilling phase of the exploratory effort, and in estimating future requirements on the basis of past performance. And as regards the matter of crude-oil reserves, we all know how widely divergent the estimates made by different persons appear to be because the basis for such estimates has not been clearly explained, or because the explanation has been omitted in quoted statements. We believe that it is highly important that appropriate organizations within this industry cooperate for clarification of this situation, and we know of no better place to seek cooperation than through the American petroleum Institute. In the pages that follow we shall have something to say: 1, about wildcatting or, to use a more widely applicable term,exploratory drilling; and, 2, about estimating crude-oil reserves. In both cases, however, our subject concerns methods of compiling and reporting statistics, and not actual figures for any selected year or period of years.I. Exploratory DrillingEarly in 1943 a correspondence, which has since become voluminous, was started by the writer on the subject of defining and classifying exploratory wells. Many geologists and petroleum engineers were consulted, and opinions were freely exchanged. Many conferences have been held with groups of technical men. Among these the most helpful has been the Subcommittee on Exploration for PAW District III.? .From the constructive criticisms and suggestions received from these several sources we have evolved, through innumerable revisions, a classification which seems to meet with general approval. This classification is not intended to refer, individually separate categories, to the numberless variations that can be cited as a result of plexities in geologic and other factors, but it is intended to cover all these varying conditions by suitable phraseology. has been devised in the simplest form consistent with broad application to all regions although it is given ill detail, with numerous explanatory in the appendix to this paper, we wish briefly to discuss it here.",,American Petroleum Institute

Brankstone,,,,,,API-44-224,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1944,"The author reviews the exploration for and the development of oil and gas fields during the year of 1943 in the 4 states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. A brief generalized history of development, together with a discussion of the regional structural and stratigraphic relationships, is incorporated as a background for the review. Certain well-known structural features and fields are treated in some detail. Discussions of wildcat drilling, as well as geological and geo physical activities, are grouped separately for each state. In summary, the author states, in part, that during the year 1943 the southeastern coastal states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida experienced increased activity. Drilling, as a result of geological and geophysical work, has added to the general knowledge of the entire area. Mississippi has advanced more in this respect that1 have the other states, although developments in Florida have added a definite impetus to a wider field of operations.INTRODUCTIONThe states of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida border the Gulf of Mexico on the north, northeast, and east. Wildcat drilling during the past year has added greatly to the geological knowledge of this large but little prospected region. Development in the area has proceeded from west to east and, for this reason, the state of Mississippi has developed more than has Alabama. The discovery of the Tinsley Field in Yazoo County, Mississippi, late in 1939, started large-scale activity. Previous to 1939, some oil had been produced in the Jackson Gas Field, Jackson County, Mississippi, but this production was not sufficient to encourage much exploratory drilling. The Tinsley Field developed rapidly, and proved that commercial production was possible. The state of Mississippi enjoyed the advantage of location, as it is located east of Louisiana and, in the past few years, has experienced a surge of competitive acreage buying. The total area of these 4 states is 216,762 square miles. The largest state in the group is Georgia, with 58,876 square miles. Mississippi is the smallest state, containing 47,716 square miles. These figures compare with 45,333 square miles for the, state of Pennsylvania and 41,222 square miles for the state of Ohio. As a comparison, the Gulf Coastal states of Texas and Louisiana contain a total of 315,862 square miles. The total area of the four coastal states east of the Mississippi River equals two-thirds of the total area of the coastal states west of the river. Distance relationships in the Gulf Coastal region of the United States are deceiving. The land distance from Natches, Miss., southwest to the Rio Grande River, is approximately 600 miles. From Natches southeast to the tip of Florida is a land distance of approximately 800 miles. Within these 4 southeastern coastal states, the area of geological interest is irregular in outline, but may be described as a band of country 120 miles wide parallel with the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and extending southeast from the Mississippi River to the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula.",,American Petroleum Institute

Tutschulte(Tide Water Associated Oil Co.),,,,,,API-45-009,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1945,"The results of a study of gas-lift performance through small ( macaroni ) tubing are presented. The individual well-behavior characteristics of a number of wells, tested while they were producing by this method of gas lift, are compared at length. Relationships between factors which affect the performance of this system of artificial lift, independent of well characteristics, are investigated and developed. A series of charts illustrating these general relationships is included in the hope that they may be of use in the application of this method of gas lift to other wells.INTRODUCTIONThe problem of how to produce an oil well in the most efficient and economic manner when it ceases to flow by its own energy is one that confronts every oil operator at some time during his producing operations. The methods of artificial lift to be considered after the flowing life of the oil well has been exhausted may be broadly classified in two categories: production by gas lifting and production by pumping. There are, of course, many different ways of utilizing gas to produce oil wells, as well as several different types of pumping systems. The application of gas lift to the production of oil through tubing of the size that is installed in many California oil wells, i.e., 2 1/2-in. and 3-m. tubing, has been thoroughly, investigated and reported within the past few years. However, relatively few data have been made available on the use of small, so-called macaroni tubing in conjunction with the use of gas for producing oil wells. The data presented in this paper have come from various sources, but were principally secured while the operation of a group of wells produced through 1 1/2-in. tubing by intermittent gas lift were being studied. Application .of the data herein presented to the group of wells studied reduced the gas consumption to 35 per cent of the gas used before the tests were made. It is believed that similar economies may be effected in other wells by careful study and analysis of the system used. It is the purpose of this report to present an analysis of gas-lift operations through L 1/2-in. ( macaroni ) tubing; to show the behavior characteristics of wells when produced by this method; to discuss some of the operating and performance characteristics encountered in gas-lifting of oil through small tubing; to indicate some of the limitations of producing oil by this method; and to present a summary of data gathered in the course of testing gas-lift wells.Extent of InvestigationIn investigating the characteristics of the gas lifting of oil through any size tubing, it is considered desirable to analyze continuous and intermittent gas lift separately. Although it is the purpose of this paper to discuss, generally, the use of macaroni strings in conjunction With the application of gas lift, the available data make it necessary to confine this discussion, for the most part, to the production of oil through 1 1/2-in.-diameter tubing, hung inside of 3-in. tubing, by gas lift using intermittent injection.",,American Petroleum Institute

This group of wells includes about one-fifth of the present producing wells in the field and about 90 per cent of all the original multi-zone completions. Of these wells, 47 were equipped to produce separately from 3 zones, with the balance -or 202-equipped to produce from 2 zones. Although the field has been producing for only about 7 years, almost 40 per cent of the wells have had to be repaired, after producing only 3.2 years, principally because of bad casing and tubing, water encroachment, and cessation of natural flow. All of the original multi-zone wells were completed flowing; of these, 42 per cent are now pumping. Not one of the multi-zone pumping wells is equipped for simultaneous production of two or more zones separately by artificial lift because of mechanical difficulties such as sand production, corrosion of flow strings and packers, and large-volume water production. In effect, more than 45 per cent of the original multi-zone wells in the field are operated at the present time, so that they are single-or combination-zone wells. Conclusions are that multi-zone development in the Wilmington Field has not been justified except where surface locations are limited, and in those cases where an advantage will be gained in a competitive area.General Description of FieldThe producing horizons in the Wilmington Field comprise a maximum thickness of about 3,000 ft divided into 6 zones, each of which is made up of alternating sands and shales. The field is divided into five separate fault blocks. The zones within these fault blocks (or in some cases combinations of two or three zones) are treated as 14 separate pools for allocation purposes. The zones differ in oil gravity, physical characteristics of the sand, and productive area.Horizons Produced in Most Multi-zone WellsThe horizons that are produced in most multi-zone wells are the Ranger, Upper Terminal, and Lower Terminal zones on each of the fault blocks previously described.1a,2Fig. 1 shows an electric log of these zones and their characteristics. The oil sands are of generally high permeability (300 md to 1,000 md) and high porosity. They are usually soft and unconsolidated, frequently causing sand trouble and cutting out of liners and tubing strings. Original formation pressure in all zones was roughly equal to the hydrostatic head measured from the surface. Originally these zones were saturated with oil and gas in solution, and initially produced with gas-oil ratios as low as 200 to 400 cu ft per bbl. Now, in the course of partial depletion, they have increased to 800 to 1,500 cu ft per bbl. Well ratios have reached values in excess of 10,000 cu ft per bbl in secondary gas caps. Most of the reservoirs in each of the five fault blocks have produced as depletion-type pools, with frequent instances of local water encroachment near the productive limits of each pool.Types and Classification of Multi-zone CompletionsDefinitionsA multi-zone well is one that is mechanically equipped to produce two or more zones simultaneously through separate flow strings without commingling the oil.",,American Petroleum Institute

Horner(Barnsdall Oil Co.),,,,,,API-45-027,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1945,"Conclusive results are now available from operation of the first project for maintenance of pressure over an entire pool by injection of extraneous water. Data obtained from 28 months of operation indicate the following results: 1, the possibility that the amount of oil recoverable during the primary stage is doubled; 2, the permissible rate of production is indicated to be twice the rate expected if injection had not been successful; 3, the costs are reasonable. The field produces from the Smackover limestone formation at a depth of about 6,500 ft. Four dry holes, converted to injection wells, receive currently approximately 8,000 bbl per day of fresh water plus 1,000 bbl per day of salt water disposed from lease-tank batteries. All of the water is injected by applying approximately 50 hp. On September 1, 1945 the pool had produced 7,500,000 bbl of oil, and 5,000,000 bbl of water had been injected. Prior to the injection project which commenced in April 1943, reservoir pressures had fallen 20 psi per month, with an oil-production rate of 5,500 bbl daily. Since February 1, 1944 reservoir pressures have risen 65 psi, with current oil-production rates up to 7,500 bbl per day. For other oil and gas pools it is suggested that, if this procedure is selected, following careful study of the pool performance, diligent engineering control should be exercised in order to insure maximum success in applying the process described.INTRODUCTIONConsiderable interest is manifested toward poolwide application of pressure maintenance by water injection as a means of adding to the recovery from oil and gas fields. Data obtained at Midway disclose conclusive results, and confirm indications which were outlined before a meeting of the Division of Production of the Institute at Chicago, November 11, 1943.1aSince that date pressure, production, and cost records have been accumulated-which may be deemed of timely importance. The earlier publication referred to showed that injection into one well, located at the edge of a pool, 1,800 acres in area caused a marked decrease in the rate of pressure decline in the pool. Since then injection has been maintained in four wells, with the result that reservoir pressures have risen-although during the same period allowables and withdrawal rates have been increased substantially.Pool ConditionsThe pool contains 41 producing wells which were completed between January 1942 and December 1943. Eight wells, initially of low productivity, are equipped for artificial lift. A productive area of approximately 1,800 acres is shown to be located on an anticlinal structure (Fig. 1), and has been found by several independent methods to contain approximately 150,000,000 bbl to 160,000,000 bbl of stock-tank oil in place. There is no gas cap, the oil being uniformly saturated with gas at a pressure of 2,528 psi, gage, a pressure which may be compared with the pool average of 2,674 psi on July 1 and 2,920 psi a t discovery. The original limits of the pool appear to be defined roughly by contact of the top of the porosity with the datum of 6,225 ft below sea level. In several instances the water-oil contact appears to have been higher, and in some cases lower.",,American Petroleum Institute

Andresen(South Penn Oil Co.),,,,,,API-45-034,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1945,"The factors that affect the rate at which a water injection well takes water are discussed. Theoretical formulas and examples of actual well behavior are given. Transient back-pressure phenomena in the reservoir are described. These phenomena have an important effect on the response of a well to changes in applied pressure. The concept of localized injectivity index, which is the conductivity of an individual input well, is introduced, and methods for its determination suggested. The factors that affect adversely the efficiency of injection wells are described, and illustrations of actual well behavior are given. Among these the plugging of the sand by suspended or dissolved solids is important. A brief discussion of controlled plugging is also included. The effect of excessive pressure in causing rupture of the formations is described, discussed, and illustrated by examples of such ruptures.INTRODUCTIONAlthough the basic formulas describing the radial flow of fluids in porous media have been in general use in oil-field engineering for several years, there are many features of actual well behavior that have never been discussed or described in published material. This paper is an attempt to describe certain of these phenomena which are important in connection with the injection of water into underground reservoirs. An attempt is made to relate the observations to the generally accepted theory. However, the explanations are considered tentative, and many more similar studies will have to be made before completely satisfactory explanations of input-well behavior are possible. This paper is in no sense a treatise on water-injection wells, but rather raises numerous problems on which further work is required.I. GENERALWater is injected into underground reservoirs to supply artificially developed energy to partly depleted reservoir rocks and thus increase the rate of oil production or, in some fields, merely as a means of disposing of an annoying byproduct. It is becoming more generally recognized that both purposes may be combined in one operation. The water is injected into the reservoirs through wells; and the efficiency of the whole process depends, in large measure, on their intake capacities. It is, therefore, worthwhile to study the behavior of injection wells, to inquire why wells in the same area often have different water-intake capacities, and to learn the reason why intake capacities vary with time in any one well. When water first is introduced into an underground reservoir through a well, the rate at which the well takes water is a maximum. The intake capacity decreases rapidly during the first few weeks, and then continues to decline more slowly, until finally almost constant quantities of water can be injected into the reservoir per unit time for long periods. The initial water-intake rate of a well depends on: 1, effective permeability of the sand 2, viscosity of the water; 3, thickness of the sand 4, effective radius of the well; 5, pressure within the reservoir; and, 6, applied water pressure. As more and more water is injected into a reservoir, other dependent factors come into the picture.",,American Petroleum Institute

Manufacturers were called upon to assist in making a series of pressure tests on new casing on field pipe racks in an effort to find a solution for the failures. Low leak resistance of threaded-and-coupled joints uncovered in these tests was the topic of discussion before the California drilling-practice committee and the California District Subcommittee on the Standardization of Oil-Country Tubular Goods. The latter committee has recommended the appointment of a subcommittee of manufacturers and users to carry out a research program for the purpose of determining changes in standards necessary to assure proper joint tightness, joint strength, and bursting strength of API casing under well conditions.INTRODUCTIONOn February 8, 1943, at a point midway between Shell Oil Company, Inc., Taylor 60 and.85 in the Ventura Avenue oil field, muddy salt water with a little gas began flowing from a side hill a t rates varying from 4,000 to 10,000 bbl per day (Fig. 1). On February 10 a 400-psi casing-pressure drop was noted at the well head of Taylor 116, located 950 ft southwest of the surface blowout, and the well was then shut in. A pressure survey made on February 10 indicated a pressure of 1,710 psi a t a depth of 7,500 ft, this pressure being about 300 psi lees than expected. A pressure survey on the following day, 22 hours after the well had been shut in, showed a pressure of only 1,680 psi a t the same depth, and a third run 24 hours later showed no increase in the bottom-hole pressure. No direct evidence of a leak in the casing was indicated by these results, but a temperature survey run in Taylor 116 on February 13 showed an abrupt increase in temperature from 90 to 106 deg F in the interval between 1,100 ft and 1,175 ft, indicating fluid flowing away from the well bore a t that interval On February 21 aquagel mud in the amount of 63 lb was circulated in Taylor 116, and the flow from the surface blowout ceased as soon as mudding operations a t Taylor 116 had been completed.

For the future flow research, laboratory techniques are suggested, with special emphasis oil experimental conditions to be avoided.

The problem has been approached in the literature from several points of view, ranging from that of the academic laboratory to work done and observations made for the purpose of achieving a specific answer to a special field problem. It is the purpose of this paper: 1, to review the work which has been accomplished with the specific purpose in mind of determining: a, those concepts regarding reservoir fluid flow which can be considered as having been established definitely, and which may thus be accepted as being basic and permanent, b, those conclusions which are not so well proved by the data, and which thus might be subject to future revision; and, 2, to suggest experiments which, remain to be performed before a reasonably complete understanding of reservoir behavior may be had. It was not possible to review all the papers which have been published which have a direct bearing on the theory of the flow of reservoir fluids. Instead, the group, as shown in the REFERENCES on p. 206, was selected as being probably most representative of the consensus of reservoir analysts.Critical Review of Literature Pertaining to the Flow of Fluids in ReservoirsOf necessity, the majority of the work designed to study the flow of fluids in petroleum reservoirs has been conducted in the laboratory. Certain significant information has resulted from a careful study and analysis of actual reservoirs; but, because of the many variants which affect the analysis on such a macroscopic scale, these types of studies seldom lead to the establishment of fundamental concepts, and are of value primarily, instead, for the purpose of corroborating the fundamental and basic concepts as developed by laboratory studies. In other words, because of the fact that the actual field behavior reflects the composite effect of many variables, the laboratory has to be relied upon to furnish the fundamental theory of the inter-action of the static and dynamic forces as they affect flow. Only in the laboratory can the number of variables be governed, and the necessary specific control of boundary conditions be achieved. As a result, the discussion to follow is limited to a consideration of factual data as established from such fundamental laboratory research.",,American Petroleum Institute

Elkins(Standard Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-46-160,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"The displacement characteristics of gas in sand and limestone reservoirs are pictorially contrasted and incorporated into the scientific approach for predicting reservoir-performance trends, using the so-called (kg/ ko) factor as related to stages of depletion within the reservoir. Apparent (kg/ ko) relationships are developed for seven reservoirs from actual performance data and compared with laboratory data. Conclusions are drawn that such apparent (kg/ ko) relationships should serve as a valuable tool in scientifically determining efficient producing rates and the proper design of gas-injection programs. The complete performance history on a prolonged gas injection experiment is presented to show the displacement characteristics of gas in one type of limestone reservoir. The importance of controlled pressure decline through adjustment of producing rates and dispersed gas injection is evidenced by fluctuations in the apparent (kg/ ko) relationship. Actual predictions of reservoir performance in one reservoir brought about by different degrees of gas injection are presented to illustrate how (kg/ ko) relationships developed from actual field performance data can be employed in predicting reservoir-performance trends for different operating conditions. In this particular reservoir it is estimated that gas injection will increase the ultimate recovery by at least 20 per cent. It is also shown that the same increase in recovery can be obtained without returning all produced gas to the reservoir.INTRODUCTIONThere is considerable concern expressed over the feasibility of gas injection in limestone pools-primarily from the fear that gas will bypass the oil and result in uncontrollable high gas-oil ratios without benefit as a driving medium. This concern is, to a certain degree, well founded, but possibly not always completely thought through. It is well to bear in mind that, in any reservoir where gas is the driving medium and the primary source of energy for delivering oil from the reservoir to producing wells, there is going to be gas bypassing. Keeping in mind reservoir performance as a whole, it is possible that the liquid saturation in certain types of pools can be reduced from 100 per cent, as discovered, to possibly 90 per cent without the production of free gas, during which time there would be no gas bypassing. Thereafter, when there is an effective permeability developed for gas, it bypasses oil in the reservoir at accelerating rates until the field is finally depleted by gas-drive action. It is, therefore, well to remember that, m a gas-drive reservoir, whether the gas has as its source injection wells or whether it has come out of solution from oil in various parts of the reservoir, it still is relatively Inefficient as a driving medium during depletion stages. It is obvious from the nature of the paper presented on this panel by W. C. Imbt and Samuel P. Ellison, Jr., entitled Porosity In Limestone and Dolomite Petroleum Reservoirs, that limestone is of such nature that it night aggravate bypassing. This is recognized by petroleum engineers in their analytical approach to predictions of reservoir performance with and without gas injection.",,American Petroleum Institute

McWilliams(Phillips Petroleum Co),,,,,,API-46-175,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"The South Burbank Pool is located in Osage County, Oklahoma. It is a Bartlesville sandstone lens pool, similar in its geological and reservoir characteristics to many Bartlesville sandstone pools in this section of Oklahoma and in eastern Kansas. The first production was obtained in January 1934. Of the 4,160 productive acres in the pool, 2,760 acres were unitized in June 1935. Gas injection was started immediately. Originally gas-cap injection was tried, and in 1941 the operation was changed to injection over the entire unit. The results of pressure maintenance, after II years or operation, reveal exceptional benefits of unitization and gas injection over competitive primary operations. Development costs were reduced 49 per cent. Ultimate operating expenses, including the cost of gas injection, will be 5 per cent less than primary. Ultimate increased oil recovery will be 87 per cent over the primary. A comparison with the nearby North Burbank Pool, having similar geological and reservoir characteristics, where delayed cooperative gas repressuring was conducted, indicates the advantages of early gas injection and unitization.INTRODUCTIONThe unitization of oil pools and the attendant injection of gas has been a subject of discussion within the oil industry for a long period of tune. It is generally recognized that complete unitization of working and royalty interests is the better method to employ In oil pools, because it will yield a greater ultimate recovery at less cost than competitive operation. There is no question that pressure maintenance by the injection of gas will recover more oil than primary pressure depletion. The question asked by the industry is the degree of benefits to be obtained by unitization and gas injection. There are few factual field examples which adequately provide the answer to this question. The South Burbank unit is one such example. The pool was discovered in January 1934, and unitized gas injection was started H years later-still in the early stages of pool development. Eleven years of operation, which is adequate to judge the ultimate benefits, have now been completed. The results to date clearly indicate that the benefits by unitized gas injection over competitive primary operation are substantial and significant. The results obtained at South Burbank are significant, because a comparison can be made of the ultimate benefits by unitized gas Injection for the South Burbank unit with a delayed cooperative gas-repressuring program conducted in the adjacent North Burbank Pool. The two pools are identical in their geological and reservoir characteristics, and differ only in respect to size. The comparison will show that pressure-maintenance operation is far superior to repressuring. Not all of the South Burbank Pool has been unitized. Of the 4,160 productive acres, 2,280 productive acres were consolidated in the unit block. The operators outside the unit have cooperatively injected gas.Location and GeologyThe South Burbank Pool is located in Osage County in northeastern Oklahoma. An outline of the pool and the South Burbank unit is given in Fig. 1. The geology of the pool has been presented in other publications,1a,2and a brief summary of the significant geological characteristics IS shown in Table 1. In its geological and reservoir characteristics, South Burbank is similar to many Bartlesville sandstone pools found to be productive in northeastern Oklahoma and in eastern Kansas.",,American Petroleum Institute

About 10,301,978,000 cu ft has been injected, and the ultimate oil recovery will be increased by about 1,700,000 bbl of oil. Although the gas input into the oolitic-lime pay zone of the main section of the pool has been profitable, the results in more permeable pay sections of the southwest section of the pool have shown heavy gas channeling and unprofitable operations which fact illustrates the hazard of gas input into highly permeable oil pay zones in limestone formations.INTRODUCTIONThe Cunningham (Kansas) Lansing lime pool has maintained pressure by gas input for 11 years, resulting in an estimated increase in ultimate oil recovery of 60 per cent-which indicates that in some types of lime pools repressuring will be successful.HistoryThe Cunningham Lansing lime pool is located in Kingman and Pratt Counties, Kansas. The field was discovered by core drilling done by Skelly Oil Company. It is one of the very few oil fields producing from limestone, where gas input has been attempted. The initial discovery well, Skelly Miles A Well No. 1, was completed in January 1932, for 253 bbl of oil daily; 53 wells are producing from the Lansing lime. The producing area is about 1,400 acres. The past production is about 3,641,290 bbl of oil. The reservoir is separated by a structurally low area carrying water from another Lansing lime pool of similar size. This other pool covers about 1,200 acres. Its initial pressure was 1,230 PSI, compared with 1,115 psi at Cunningham, and it also had a lower water-oil contact datum.Geology and Formation CharacteristicsThe Cunningham Lansing pool has a producing closure of 75 ft. The oil production in the northeastern part of the pool is found chiefly in a thin, oolitic bed about 4 ft thick, which occurs about 30 ft below the top of the Lansing. Very thin, cherty, oblitic streaks carry some oil locally below the main pay. To the southwest, the upper 15 ft of Lansing develops considerable porosity, carrying gas, then oil, on the structurally lower wells. This is often the best pay zone in the southwestern section of the pool. Variations in permeability and porosity cause erratic results in production. However, the fairly constant gas-oil contact and oil-water datum noted in standard-tool wells indicate that folding has produced vertical fractures resulting in communication between the producing zones, hence, these zones constitute a common reservoir. The average pay thickness is estimated at 8 ft. The pay zones have an average permeability of 105 md, and porosity of about 11 per cent. The average gas-oil ratio of natural production prior to acid treatment was 2,000 cu ft per barrel. After acid treatment, the oil production increased about 300 per cent with a 4,000-cu-ft gas-oil ratio. This increased gas-oil ratio may indicate that acid treatment would in some fields give better efficiency if used when the gas has been partly depleted.",,American Petroleum Institute

Gas is injected into the oil-sand conglomerate zone in the Del Rey hills area during the summer and fall, and is withdrawn during the winter. Although some of the injected gas has migrated to neighboring properties in the field, the project has been helpful in meeting peak gas demands during the winter.INTRODUCTIONDuring the early part of 1942 it was recognized that the expansion of industry In the Los Angeles area, as a result of the war effort, was likely to overtax the ability of public utilities to furnish gas during the winter months. Although some surplus gas was anticipated during the summer, production from the Los Angeles Basin could not be increased sufficiently to meet peak demands during the winter, and it was apparently not feasible to construct additional pipe-line or compressor facilities to deliver gas from the San Joaquin Valley because of wartime restrictions on the use of materials. The only apparent solution to the problem was to provide storage capacity so that surplus gas could be stored during the summer and withdrawn during periods of peak demand. As the construction of surface storage of the required capacity was entirely impracticable, it was concluded that it would be necessary to store the gas underground. The need for a reservoir was thought to be of such urgency that Professor John F. Dodge was retained by the Railroad Commission and the Department of Natural Resources of the state of California to make a survey of the possible subsurface storage reservoirs In the Los Angeles area. After considerable investigation, it was conclude8 that the Del Rey hills area of the Playa Del Rey Field offered the greatest promise as an underground storage reservoir. Further study of the possibility of gas storage in this pool by Professor Dodge and Roy A. Wehe convinced them of the practibility of this project, and their conclusions were submitted to the Railroad Commission and the Department of Natural Resources on July 20, 1942.' The project was then discussed with representatives of the army and the federal government, and it was decided that immediate action should be taken to initiate the storage project. Because of the diverse ownership of interests In the properties in the Del Rey hills area, it was not feasible to obtain the required properties by direct purchase; therefore, the properties were condemned and taken over by the Defense Plant Corporation on September 29, 1942. The Union Oil Company of California was designated as the operator of the property for the Defense PlantCorporation, and the Southern California Gas Company agreed to furnish the gas for storage, to dispose of the gas withdrawn, and to provide the necessary main lines and compression facilities. The property was transferred from the Defense Plant Corporation to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation on July 1, 1945.",,American Petroleum Institute

For this analysis the term secondary recovery has been considered to refer only to fluid-injection projects instigated after a reservoir has almost reached its economic limit by primary-recovery methods. Current theoretical concepts pertaining to secondary recovery methods of operation are summarized in the test. For future research, certain types of tests are suggested with special emphasis on experimental conditions to be avoided. Data are presented for past and current secondary-recovery or gas- or oil-storage operations in 26 California fields, in 8 of which operations are still in progress.

However, some small-scale projects may prove to be economically attractive.INTRODUCTIONThe California District Topical Committee on Production Technology undertook to review recent investigations pertaining to the secondary recovery of oil.

For the purpose of this analysis, secondary recovery has been limited to water flooding and air- or gas-drive procedures of the type currently being applied primarily to the Eastern and Mid Continent oil fields of the United States. Furthermore, in keeping with the proposed Glossary Relating to Reservoir Behavior, as prepared by the committee (not yet published in final form), the term secondary recovery has been considered to refer only to the recovery by any method (natural flow or artificial lift) of that petroleum which enters a well as a result of augmentation of the native reservoir energy (as by fluid injection) after a reservoir has almost reached its economic production limit by primary-recovery methods. Hence, mining and thermal methods of secondary recovery, as well as primary pressure-control methods of operation, have not been considered in this analysis.

379,320929,,The Rehabilitation Of Drowned Gas Wells,S.T. Yuster(Pennsylvania State College),,,,,,API-46-209,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"Water-drowned gas-producing or injection wells are major problems of oil and gas producers. Water from leaky casing, excessive coning due to too rapid withdrawals, necessary drowning to control a wild well or make repairs, may all cause an almost permanent harm to a gas well by reducing its capacity. This is not only a problem confronting gas men, but is of great interest to oil producers, as gas wells play an important part in recycling operations, pressure maintenance, repressuring projects, and in secondary recovery by air and gas drive; In all these eases, the effect of the presence of water is to retard the flow of gas from, or into, the formation. A study was made of the problem, and it was found to be due to the establishment of a Jamin action. The application of high vapor-pressure low surface-tension liquids, which are completely miscible with water, removed the plugging action almost completely. Some of the liquids used with success were acetone and a 940-1 mixture of acetone and diethyl ether. Methods were also developed for the safe drowning of gas wells, so that a well could be brought back to production after treatment, with very little change in productivity. The results of some successful field tests are given.INTRODUCTIONThe revival of intentionally or accidentally drowned gas wells is a problem which has confronted gas producers for as long as the industry has existed. The water, which may have come from leaky casing, from other horizons, or from actual injection at the surface for the purpose of controlling a wild well, may build up a head in excess of the formation pressure and penetrate the producing strata. In repressuring projects or in the secondary recovery of petroleum by air- and gas-drive methods, the entrance of water into the productive horizon at the input wells is very harmful. In all these examples, the effect of the water is to retard the flow of gas from or into the formation. In some cases the action may be so drastic as to close off flow completely. This effect in the case of a gas-producing well is not due to a head of water which neutralizes either partly or completely the formation pressure, because pumping the water off the well does not bring it back to its former productivity.Nature of Plugging ActionThere are a maximum of 3 possible phenomena which are responsible for the reduction in conductivity of the formation. They are:Reduction in effective permeability of the formation because of the presence of a liquid saturation.The formation of Jamin bubbles.The swelling of clays by the intruding water.It is a well-known fact in petroleum and natural-gas engineering that the presence of a liquid saturation in a porous medium reduces the effective permeability of that medium to a gas; and, the greater the liquid saturation, the greater the reduction. A French physicist named Jamin, in 1860, found that, when bubbles of gas are dispersed in a liquid, appreciable pressures are required to force these bubbles through constrictions in a conduit.",,American Petroleum Institute

Steinle(The Texas Co.),,,,,,API-46-217,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"The detailed subsurface studies of five water-drive reservoirs in Illinois serve as a background for the information and conclusions presented in this paper. Core analyses, electrical logs, subsurface sample analyses, and production-performance histories provide the basic data available for each reservoir. Well densities, rates of withdrawal, characteristics of the reservoir media, and properties of the reservoir fluids were studied to determine their effects upon recoveries. Ultimate recoveries estimated from these pools, all of which are nearly depleted, range from 400 to 482 bbl per acre-foot. This is equivalent to from 50 to 57.7 per cent of the tank oil originally in place. These are relatively high recoveries from Illinois reservoirs, and the study of these five pools should, therefore, prove of practical interest. The purpose of this paper is to present results of the analysis of these reservoirs as an addition to the background of reservoir performance-which background is necessary to determine the number of wells which should be drilled, and to insure proper production practices.Structural FeaturesIn Table 1 are outlined the structural features of each of the 5 fields. They vary in productive area from 570 up to 1,800 acres, and have gently sloping flanks and low structural relief. The shapes of the reservoirs range from domal to elongated anticlinal, with a longitudinal axis three times the length of the transverse axis. The presence of considerable structural relief is usually considered responsible in a large degree for efficient water drive and high ultimate recovery. Large relief insures better control of the advancing water front, reducing the tendency toward coning, channeling, and bypassing, by affording a better opportunity for the desired gravitational segregation of the oil and water within the reservoir. The low closures of 20ft to 50ft leave permeable water sand underlying the oil-bearing sand throughout most of the productive area of each of the 5 pools. In clean sands this would tend toward early water coning, resulting in the early abandonment of wells and low recoveries. A withdrawal rate sufficiently low to prevent water coning would be too low to result in an operating profit. The fact that relatively high recoveries were obtained from these reservoirs must, therefore, be attributed to other factors.TABLE 1 Structural Features(available in full paper)Characteristics of Reservoir MediaThe reservoir media of these five pools consist of relatively well-sorted sands, laminated with shale, silt, and calcareous materials which limit the vertical permeability. These laminae are evident from visual examination of most cores, but generally they cannot be detected from electrical logs, or from core-analysis profiles showing only horizontal permeability and porosity. The fact that water coning did not occur in these pools is probably attributable to the lack of continuity in vertical permeability, due to the presence of these laminae. The advancement of edge water was predominately parallel to the bedding planes, with the uniformity of encroachment dependent almost entirely upon the uniformity of lateral permeability. Although edge water did channel through to some of the wells through more permeable strata, the effect was not sufficiently great seriously to reduce ultimate recovery.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lawry(The Ohio Oil Co.),,,,,,API-46-221,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"Bypassing of injection water, or water from which very little or almost no useful energy is derived, is divided into three general types:Differential movement of water through cracks or fissures containing negligible amounts of oil. This includes movement through shale or coal, and is the type usually referred to as channeling.Differential movement of water through layers of relatively high specific permeability, compared to the permeability of the horizon as a whole.Differential movement of water through layers of relatively low oil saturation, or with high permeability to water. This may be movement through ancient now depleted gas sands, water sands, or sections of the producing horizon depleted due to gravity drainage.Bypassing of type (1), or channeling, is usually considered to be the most troublesome, and generally indicates that a weak shale or coal streak or section is associated with the producing zone. Channeling can often be remedied by pumping mud-and-fiber mixtures into the bad injection well until the channel is plugged off; and then, by washing and air-jetting the surplus out of the well, the normal injection life of the input well may be resumed. The use of injection pressures below critical for the area, as determined by experience, and the exclusion of coal and shale streaks from exposure with the sand body are suggested to help prevent channeling. Discussion of bypassing of types (2) and (3) is also given, and steps which may be taken to help in dealing with them are suggested.INTRODUCTIONThere seems to be no greater problem in water-flood operations than the control of useless or wasteful water injection; Le., water from which very little benefit is derived in moving oil through the porous medium. This condition is commonly spoken of as bypassing or channeling. Because this condition may lead to unprofitable operations, or may make serious inroads into profits, the study of this subject is going on constantly. The principal purpose in presenting this paper is to offer, as an approach to minimizing bypassing and channeling in water-flood operations, certain general considerations and observations of the author, together with certain field procedures and operating methods which, in the opinion of the author, have proved to be at least steps in the right direction. It is with this thought in mind that it is hoped that this paper will be helpful to water-flood operators, and serve such operators as an approach to the solution of their own problems pertaining to bypassing or channeling on individual properties. Bypassing in water flooding may be divided into three distinct classes:1aDifferential movement of water through cracks or fissures containing negligible amounts of oil. This includes movement through shale or coal, and is the type usually referred to as channeling.Differential movement of water through layers of relatively high specific permeability, compared to the permeability of the horizon as a whole.Differential movement of water through layers of relatively low oil saturation, or with high permeability to water.

Young Jr.(Bradley Producing Corp.)|R,,,,,,API-46-228,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"Water flooding for the purpose of producing oil has been practiced successfully in the Bradford and Allegany Fields for many years. Numerous properties have reached their economic limit, and many more are approaching it. Very often it is observed that, during late stages of a flooding operation, not only oil production decreases to a low value, but water-injection and water-production rates do likewise. Such behavior of a water-flood operation contradicts all theoretical predictions. During the later stage of a water flood, very frequently the flooding process becomes highly inefficient, and the principal reason for such inefficiency is the fact that water-input rates have not been maintained in the most favorable manner possible. It has been recognized that maintaining and increasing water-input rates can be of great benefit. The problem of maintaining and increasing injection rates at water-input wells has been studied by the Eastern District members of the API Topical Committee on Production Technology, and this paper is a report on this study by some members of the committee. In Part I, Advantages of Increased Injection Rates at Water-Input Wells, the function and behavior of water-intake wells are discussed. Any factor that causes a continued decrease in the intake rate of a water-injection well causes inefficiency in its operation. The discussion is based on the somewhat arbitrary assumption that ultimate oil recovery is independent of velocity of flooding. The rate of oil production, however, is directly proportional to the flood velocity. It may be desirable to decrease injection rates into beds already flushed of their recoverable oil, but it is usually desirable to increase rates into the less permeable beds in which the flood is moving slowly. Theoretical considerations, supported by field data, indicate that the water-oil ratio of the liquids produced is independent of the water-injection rate, but increases with progressing depletion of the sand. Decreased injection rates result in decreased flow of fluids and, therefore, decreased rates of oil production. Conversely, increased rates result in increased oil production. Field examples are given to illustrate this. Increased rates of injection are very desirable from an economic basis, because they result in either faster depletion, with savings in total operating expense, or fewer wells, with savings in development expense. Part 2 deals with Effect of Properties of Flood Water on Rate of Input and Oil Production. It discusses the properties of a flood water which may cause a reduction of the conductivity of the sand to water when the water comes into contact with the sandstone. Clay materials, present to some extent in all sandstone formations, are most likely to be affected by contact with the injected water. A study is made of the various reactions of ions on the structure of the clay materials. The possible causes for the swelling of the clays and the subsequent reductions in conductivity are discussed. Some laboratory tests are interpreted in the light of the effects of various properties of flood water on clay materials.",,American Petroleum Institute

Field(Sohio Petroleum Co),,,,,,API-46-256,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"The number of wells equipped for electrical operation is gradually increasing. Under certain conditions, a considerable saving in lease-operating expense is possible through installation of electrical equipment. Under other conditions, it is more economical to pump a lease with gas engines than with electrical energy. The cost of installation and operation of generating plants is included in this paper. A curve indicating the approximate electrical energy consumption per barrel of fluid produced, and methods of application, are also includedINTRODUCTIONThe pumping of oil wells with electric power dates as far back as 1892, when 5 wells on a lease in West Virginia were equipped with 3-phase 3-hp motors.1aIn the early days of electrical pumping of oil wells, there were many wells operated with alternating current, and there were also a few installations designed for direct-current operation. Today almost all electric motors used for pumping wells are operated by alternating current. The universal acceptance of alternating current power, and the many advantages of alternating current over direct-current operation are well known by every student of electricity.The petroleum industry has lagged behind all other major industries in the adoption of electrical power for the operation of principal equipment. This is especially true in production operations. There are many large companies that have less than 10 per cent of their total pumping wells operated by electric power. There are several reasons why the oil industry has been so reluctant to use electrical power. In the first place, fuel has been available on a majority of leases in the form of natural gas-and, without a market, the gas was vented to the atmosphere. Hence, it has been difficult to convince operators that electric motors should be installed for operation of pumping equipment when the cost of electrical energy had to be compared with the cost of operation of a gas engine for which there was no charge for fuel.Another reason for the slow acceptance of electrical power for oil-field pumping was the use of inefficient pumping equipment. It was the customary practice to install rig fronts for individual-well operation. The efficiency of the rig front was of minor importance as long as gas engines that operated on lease fuel were employed. The operators that installed electric motors on rig fronts soon realized that the inefficiency of this ' type of equipment was the primary cause of high charges for electrical energy. The early experience with electric motors was not soon forgotten; and, even in recent years, it has often been difficult to convince an operator that pumping wells with an electric motor could be economical.The rig front had been used to service a well in addition to pumping it. With the introduction of the efficient and compact geared pumping units in the late 1920's, and the development of the portable well-servicing unit, there was no longer any need for installation of the rig fronts-although, as late as 1939, new rig fronts were being installed.",,American Petroleum Institute

Joints(Engineering Research Division Southern Research Institute),,,,,,API-46-275,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"This paper summarizes an extensive experimental program made to evaluate the relative effects of various factors on the resistance of threaded joints to leakage under gas pressure. The tests showed that, within the limits of the experimental program, the tolerance on the thread elements had no influence on the leakage resistance. Of most importance in leakage resistance are:makeup; and,thread lubricant.These tests indicate further studies should be given to both lubricant and makeup in order to improve the leak resistance of such joints.SUMMARYThis paper summarizes the results of an extensive investigation Experimental made to determine the effect of thread element tolerances, Makeup, and lubricant on leakage characteristics of threaded joints. This general program was designed according to methods of statistical analysis, and the analysis carried out on the basis of these methods. The results of this investigation show :, under power-tight conditions, using thread compounds similar to those used in oil-field practice, thread leakage was not found;, under power-tight conditions as defined in the paper, and utilizing SAE-10 oil as the thread lubricant, the leakage rates had no relation to the thread elements involved. This condition indicates that further reducing of the thread tolerances would not improve the thread leakage resistance of pipe joints. These tests also indicate that thread leakage can be prevented;first, by utilization of the proper compound and, second, by proper attention to thread makeup.The series of tests made with hand-tight conditions as defined in this paper indicates that the most important consideration, insofar as thread leakage is concerned under these conditions, is the type of lubricant or compound which is used. These tests also show that the rate of leakage, as determined by measuring the quantity of gas which leaks from the joint, was influenced to a lesser degree by taper, lead, pressure, and wear of chasers. The general conclusions which can be drawn from this investigation are :That, for power-tight makeup conditions, the tolerance on the thread elements within the limits as covered by this investigation did not have any influence on the leakage resistance of the threaded joints.The type of thread compound or lubricant used has a very important effect on the leakage resistance of threaded joints both for power-tight and hand tight makeup.Makeup conditions have a most important bearing on the effect of leakage resistance of threaded joints.Although present pipe-thread lubricants do a reasonably good job insofar as improving leakage resistance is concerned, the importance which the lubricant plays in the leakage resistance indicates that lubricant manufacturers should give attention to improving those characteristics which lead to better leakage resistance.The importance which makeup plays in joint tightness indicates that a careful and scientific study should be made of field practices.",,American Petroleum Institute

West(West and Cole Construction Co.),,,,,,API-46-302,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"The corrosion problem is, of course, an old one. The petroleum industry has always been confronted with certain phases of this problem, and the corrosion of high-pressure distillate-well equipment is a comparatively new phase of an old problem. There are now operating approximately 100 distillate fields in this country; and, although a few of these fields are more than 10 years old, the majority have been brought in during the past 6 or 7 years. As far as the oil operator is concerned, distillate-well corrosion is. therefore, a development of the past few years. Sufficient concern regarding this problem had accumulated by late 1943 to cause the first organized attempt by the various interested parties to gain more general knowledge as to causes of this type of corrosion, and to develop means of prevention. Early in 1944 both the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Natural Gasoline Association of America (NGAA) organized high-pressure distillate-well corrosion committees for this purpose. The NGAA solicited contributions from various operating companies, and therewith initiated a research program for the purpose of investigating both the causes and means of prevention of this particular type of corrosion. In order to avoid duplication of effort, and in order to obtain the most satisfactory and complete results in the least amount of time, the API Special Subcommittee on Corrosion of High-Pressure Production Equipment, a similar committee organized by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers, the U. S. Bureau of Mines, and the research departments of many of the producing companies joined in active cooperation with the NGAA-sponsored research program. This cooperative undertaking has been in progress for approximately two years; and, although general knowledge of the subject throughout the petroleum industry because of this work has increased in many ways; and, although many of the research results obtained both from the laboratory and from the field have been very gratifying, the practical answers to the problem are far from being solved. Consequently, the research work must continue, and continue with accelerated effort. More emphasis should be placed on field experimental work so as to:, improve on the present means of well-head inspection for corrosive attack;, ascertain what material or materials, if any, are resistant to this particular type of corrosive action and can be used as practical substitutes for the presently used well materials; and,, determine an efficient and satisfactory chemical that can be used as a neutralizer or used as an inhibitor to the corrosive action, and an efficient and practical means of introducing such chemical into the bottom of the well.It is not the purpose of this paper to present the technical aspects of the corrosion problem, nor to go into detailed descriptions of the research work being conducted by the various organizations and the results obtained there from, but to give a general picture of the overall corrosion problem including the extent and characteristics of corrosion in the different distillate fields, the hazards and economic losses confronting the oil operator,",,American Petroleum Institute

The effects of acidic-water corrosion are illustrated and discussed. The use of plastic-coated pipe, and the use of soda ash as a neutralizing agent, are described as being practical means of reducing corrosion losses in the Katy Field. The need for continued research and for field testing of alloys is pointed out. Instead of waiting for a complete understanding of such problems, it is advocated that full-scale field tests be initiated as soon as corrosion is found in new fields. The arrangement of subsurface equipment to facilitate corrosion control is discussed briefly. The importance of keeping equipment in safe working condition is emphasized.INTRODUCTIONThe corrosion of equipment used in producing condensate reservoirs is becoming an old problem in the industry. Most of the present knowledge pertaining to the subject has been well summarized in the form of tentative conclusions in a recent API paper.1aIntensive efforts are being continued on this problem by committees under the sponsorship of the American Petroleum Institute (API), Natural Gasoline Association of America (NGAA), and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE). Additional work is being done by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, and by the research and operating departments of the producing companies.It is the purpose of this paper to present the specific problem encountered in one of the larger condensate fields, and to discuss the problem essentially from an operating viewpoint.Long periods of research are in prospect. Because of the numerous unevaluated and possibly some unrecognized variables connected with the problem, and because of the apparent inconsistency of the observed phenomena, a major effort should be directed toward full-scale field experiments. This is being done in the Katy Field; and, although all corrosion is not under control, a reasonably early solution of the problem in that field appears likely.The Katy gas-condensate field, located in Waller, Harris, and Fort Bead Counties about 30 miles northwest of Houston, Texas, is an oblong domal structure covering an area of approximately 30,000 acres. The average well depth is 7,600 ft. The formation between 6,250 ft and 7,450 ft below sea level is divided into 6 separate sand reservoirs-each of which consists of one or more lenticular members. The porosity of the sands varies from 18 to 35 per cent. Each reservoir has a definite water table, and producing wells are completed well above the gas-water contact.The field was discovered in 1935, and developed rather slowly. A cycling plant was put into operation in January 1943, and an absorption plant was added later in 1943. The entire field as unitized, and the plant was enlarged in 1944. The present major facilities in the field consist of: 33 producing wells; 36 miles of gathering lines ; an absorption-compressor plant;34 miles of injection lines; and 13 injection wells.",,American Petroleum Institute
388,320937,,Porosity In Limestone And Dolomite Petroleum Reservoir,William C. Imbt(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.)|Samuel P. Ellison,,,,,,API-46-364,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1946,"Porosity in limestone and dolomite reservoirs is created by primary conditions of deposition, and later altered by the secondary forces of moving ground waters. Meteoric waters are probably the most important reason for the existence of limestone and dolomite reservoirs. Waters charged with carbonic or organic acids are capable of dissolving limestone and dolomite. Primary porosity may be greatly increased by solution, or it may be totally destroyed by chemical precipitation. Precipitation of carbonates usually takes place below the water table where the fluids are usually alkaline and the movement of water retarded. Through the development of a technique of impregnating core samples with the plastic Catalin and then subjecting the impregnated rock to solution in hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid, it is possible to obtain an accurate cast of the original porosity. By this method study it is now possible to get a three-dimensional view of porosity in limestone, dolomite, and sandstone. Plastic casts of porosity in oil reservoirs from the Permian and Devonian of West Texas, Hunton of Oklahoma, and Arbuckle of Kansas permit a geological explanation for the formation the porosity, and demonstrate the dissolving action of acid-charged waters. It is now possible through the use of plastic casts to clearly show continuity of porosity in limestone and dolomite reservoir rocks.INTRODUCTIONThe oil industry is vitally interested in the subject of porosity, whether it be in sandstone or limestone reservoirs. The geologist employs qualitative measures of porosity to implement the drilling, coring, and testing of wells. he producing department, operator, and engineer utilize porosity information in the acidizing, perforating, and completion of wells. The geologist and engineer also use porosity information in estimating reserves, and in the appraisal of producing Properties. A clear understanding of the reasons for porosity is important in order to better appreciate the significance of porosity in the carbonate group of rocks.It is intended in this paper to include porosities of dolomites, dolomitic limestone, and all other combinations of dolomite and limestone, because the primary and secondary Processes causing porosity are the same in any of these varieties of rock.It is not the purpose of this paper to review in detail all of the literature on limestone and dolomite porosity. However, a selected list of references is included herein.Classification of Limestone and Dolomite PorositiesThe engineer and operator interested in repressuring and recovery problems may approach the study of porosity on the basis of:size of openings;shape of openings; andorigin of openings.A combination of all of these factors is necessary to illustrate each example of porosity, and to treat the engineering problems involved.Size:Porosity in calcareous rocks ranges in size from sub-capillary (tubular openings less than 0.0002 mm in diameter) through capillary (tubular openings from 0.0002 mm to 0.5 mm in diameter) to super-capillary (tubular openings greater than 0.5 mm in diameter).",,American Petroleum Institute

Welge(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-47-166,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1947,"The theoretical and laboratory experimental work relative to connate water is discussed. A description of the restored-state technique is presented, and data from restored-state tests are given. A comparison of the results from restored-state tests with the analysis of water in cores recovered with oil-base drilling muds shows that there is agreement within the limits required for reservoir engineering work. It is shown that, with highly argillaceous cores, porosity may be difficult or impossible to measure, and the Oil in place may be better expressed as a fraction of the bulk rock volume. In such cases the concept of net porosity is recommended. With the use of the restored-state technique cores can be prepared for other tests, such as relative permeability experiments, and water- and gas-drive studies. The use of restored-state tests as an and in electric-log interpretation is also discussed.Existence of Connate WaterFor the purpose of this discussion, connate water will be defined as that interstitial formation water which co-exists with oil or gas in a petroleum reservoir at the time the reservoir is first drilled. It is realized that this definition is at variance With the original geological definition of the term, connate water. However, common usage has made the aforementioned arbitrary definition a part of petroleum technology. It is now reasonably well established1-4athat connate water, as defined hereinbefore, exists in virtually all natural accumulations of petroleum-although, because of flushing with drilling fluid, very little of it has been recovered from the cores heretofore Connate water has been found at the top of several reservoirs having as much as 2,000 ft of vertical oil column from the water-oil contact to the crest of the structure One set of cores has been obtained with oil-base mud from the Rangely Field in Colorado 600 ft above the water-oil contact These cores contained almost 50 per cent formation water when received. Common usage has made It necessary for laboratories to report connate water as per cent of pore volume. Actually, the engineer wants to know the per cent of bulk core volume filled with oil, so that total oil can be directly computed from the acre-feet of oil section. Both quantities will be used in this discussion because, except in those cases when porosity is unknown, oil in place can be determined from connate water, or vice versa In argillaceous rock, the grams are so swollen and altered when wetted that the dry porosity may bear little relation to the porosity available for fluid occupancy in the reservoir. In this event It may be difficult to measure the reservoir porosity at all, and it may not really be necessary provided one expresses the original oil in place as a percentage of the bulk volume of the core, as suggested hereinbefore.Theory and Laboratory ExperimentsTheory6indicated that oil and water co-exist in porous media in such a way that the percentage of oil and water in any given porous medium depends upon the difference in pressure between the two phases and, possibly, upon which of the two fluids was in place first.",,American Petroleum Institute

Masters(Standard Oil Co of California),,,,,,API-47-257,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1947,"This paper describes the equipment and method used to determine the magnitude of the changes in stress in oil-well casing after it had been in place in a well, and while it had been affected by varying temperatures and pressures during drilling and producing operations. The data from two tests indicate:The casing landing tension varies widely, as the casing is affected by temperature and pressure conditions in the well.The freeze point of the casing sometimes rises very rapidly from the top of the cement to the shoe of the next size casing.Temperature and pressure changes tend to cause the casing above the top of the cement to move up or down through any freeze points which are quickly formed by caving formationsAll of the casing above the top of the cement tends to act as free casing because of the movement of the casing through the caved-in freeze points.Apparent freeze points above the top of the cement may cause erroneous landing weights.Properly landed casing will not develop dynamic stresses of dangerous magnitude during drilling operations carried on inside of it.Stress variations during producing operations are likely to be more severe than those encountered during drilling operations.INTRODUCTIONThere has been considerable discussion as to the proper tension with which to land long strings of casing so as to provide a proper margin of safety under large changes of temperature and pressure during later drilling and producing operations. There also has been some question as to the size of the dynamic stresses induced by drilling operations inside of this casing. Most of these discussions have been based on calculations and assumptions which did not have the benefit of complete field data on the stresses encountered in casing after it had been cemented m place and landed on the casinghead. It was in an attempt to obtain these field data that this experiment was conducted On account of the occurrence of several casing failures in wells at Kettleman Hills, the tests were conducted in that field. The normal procedure at Kettleman Hills is to set either 500 ft or 2,500 ft of 13 3/8-in surface casing-the greater length depending on whether the well is drilled in a portion of the field where greater trouble with lost circulation is encountered. Next, approximately 7,000 ft of 8 5/8-in casing is set above the oil zone and cemented with 1,000 sacks of cement from 7,000 ft to about 4,500 ft. Then approximately 1,500 ft of hole is made before liner is set. The measurement of stresses m the 8 5/8 casing was attempted because a considerable number of drilling operations were carried on inside of it, and because it was used as the production string The tests on the casing were conducted in 2 wells well No 23-11P With 500 ft of surface casing, and well No 84-21Q with 2,500 ft surface pipe, so as to be assured of a great variation in the length of free 8 5/8-in casing.

Two general types now are being employed (1) the large self-contained platform, and (2) the combination of small platform with floating drilling tender. Platform construction now follows two general types, one employing large steel tubular pile, few m number, braced by prestressed steel cables, and the other using a larger number of smaller steel piling driven through jackets or templates. Drilling to date has resulted In the discovery of 4 oil fields, 3 gas-condensate fields, and 1 dry-gas field Nine companies operating off the Louisiana coast and four operating off the Texas coast are now drilling a total of 32 wells.Oil and gas exploration and development along the Louisiana-Texas Gulf Coast led some years ago to the water's edge. Many of the nation?s most prolific fields had been found on the s a l t domes located along the coastal belt. As the marshes, bays, swamps, and bayous were explored, and a soil and gas fields were developed by the use of submersible-barge and stationary-platform methods, it became increasingly apparent that the salt-dome , structures which had proved s o prolific n the land areas and In the protected waters would underlie the storm-tossed waters of the Gulf of Mexico.For a number of years after the potentialities of the shallow water-covered areas of the continental shelf off Louisiana and Texas had become evident, exploration was stalemated largely because methods and techniques r locating and mapping s a l t domes in the unprotected ocean waters were not sufficiently advanced, and there were no known methods or equipment for drilling and developing such oil- and gas-bearing areas.First Open-Water Drilling StructureIt was not until 1937 that the first drilling structure was built in the unprotected waters of the Gulf of Mexico by The Pure Oil Company and the Superior Oil Company south of Creole, Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

A glossary of some of the terms used by the directional drilling engineer is included. Important considerations the planning and execution?s of a directional program are detailed, and the advantages and disadvantages of drilling deflected holes are discussed. It IS pointed out that, despite rapid past development of new tools and operating techniques, the need for additional development exists, notably in the improvement of devices for directional surveying.INTRODUCTIONWithin a relatively few years the status of directional drilling has changed from that of an common expedient to that of a routine drilling procedure, as a result of significant advances in the art of controlling direction holes. These advances have made possible the economic development of several oil fields in the United States, as well as the extension of many other fields into otherwise inaccessible areas.Conversely, the problems encountered in the drilling of these fields encouraged the development of new tools and operating techniques. Greatest progress, however, has been in the planning of the directional program. As a result, the effectiveness of the entire process is such that the planning, drilling, and production of deflected wells can be done in an orderly and economic manner.Responsibility for the planning and execution of a directional-drilling program is usually divided among several organizations or departments of one organization. This, In turn, implies that each person involved has a thorough knowledge of the entire procedure. This is particularly true of the petroleum engineer who is responsible for planning and supervising the directional program. He must be able to evaluate the suitability the of drillings sites, recognize the advantages and disadvantages inherent in different drilling procedures, and plan the wells in such a manner that geologic conditions are met, and that legal, contractual, and economic limits are not exceeded.Historical BackgroundSome of the basic tools and procedures used in directional drilling have been known, at least in crude form, for decades. For instance, a man whose active experience in the industry dates from 1896 has informed the author that a t least 2 removable whipstocks were run on cable tools between 1897 and 1900. In addition, directional surveys were made by watching the course followed by an oil lantern which had been lowered down the bore hole on a line. Occasions arise today which cause engineers and directional supervisors to which that this uncomplicated procedure were applicable to their problems.Drilling booms in such areas as Signal Hill, Santa Fe Springs, Dominguez, and Huntington Beach were responsible for the rapid development of directional. drilling.The oldest and simplest method of directionally deflecting the well was that of orienting 'the entire rig, then blocking up one side of the rotary table so as to incline the kelly. The desired results were usually accomplished, although the method had several disadvantages, as both drill pipe and casing slips were difficult to set properly, and driving-chain breakage was Increased. However, the method is still used when it is desired to deflect the hole a t a very shallow depth.",,American Petroleum Institute

Graser(Cleveland Oil Co.),,,,,,API-49-071,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"This paper discusses the forces which cause a well to deviate from the vertical, and how these forces-along with the use of reamers-may be applied to control the deviation of a hole from the vertical. The geometry of setting deflection or the control of directionally drilled wells, and the transfer of the geometrical values to vector quantities, are discussed. The additional deflection obtained from follow-up runs is also discussed, and it metrical relationship to the original setting of the Deflection tool is explained. The economics of directional drilling is discussed briefly.The subject of directional drilling has been considered by many authors who have discussed the purposes, tools, surveys, and the like. Each author has bypassed the basic fundamentals, until a bit of mysticism seems to have developed in the minds of men uninitiated in directional drilling. The purpose of this paper is to show that no mysteries are present, but that the general problems of directional drilling re solvable by elementary and fundamental mechanics.Another paper by D. L. Roberts1is being given at this session which also appears in this volume. It deals with the factors, beyond our control, which influence directional drilling, how these factors may be used to advantage, as well as variations in the drill string in order to control the course of the well.The present author believes that a discussion of the fundamental geometry and mechanics of directional drilling will result in a better understanding of the problems found in the field. The service company and oil company directional-drilling engineers have made a very definite place for themselves. Their continuous work in this specialized field enables them to supervise directional drilling with a minimum of experimentation. A part of their work involves engineering mechanics, and a part is the application of experience. Sometimes their judgment is questioned, and this may result in a more costly drilling job unless the company engineer understands the basic reasoning. One of the most difficult things to visualize is the deflection tool is faced 90 deg, or more, from the direction which the well should drift to reach the objective. Another phase which may be difficult to understand is why a follow-up should be expected, and how it should change the direction or the amount of deflection of the hole. Herein follow-up is considered as the change in drift angle and direction-in addition to that obtained directly from the deflection tool, but a s a result of the use of the deflection tool.

Craig(The National Supply Company),,,,,,API-49-103,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"This paper comment briefly on the practical aspects of power required for rotary drilling and the diesel and gas engines used for the purpose.For some time there has been a general rule in the industry that a rotary-drilling rig, for efficient operation, should be powered to the extent of 100 hp per 1,000 ft of depth rating. General practice and field observations indicate that this rule applies for hoisting operations and for average requirements for the mud pumps, but for the larger- diameter holes, more power than designated by this rule is advisable.Most drilling operations are performed with 4%-in. drill pipe, and, taking into account tackle, drill collars, and floating effect, 20 Ib per ft of the drilling string IS a close approximation of the weight which the hoisting equipment is called upon to handle. A drilling rig rated at 10,000 ft must hoist a 200,000-lb string of drill pipe, a rig rated at 13,500 ft, a 250,000-lb string, etc. With most manufacturers of drilling machinery, it can be considered that the equipment is suitable or at least 5 percent beyond the depth rating.With reference to drawworks design, it IS preferable that the rated loading of drill pipe can be hoisted In the third or fourth speed (a speed ratio about halfway between low and high). A 12,500-ft drawworks and drive group, equipped with four 300-hp engines hoists its rated string of 41/2-in. pipe in approximately 50 sec net per 90-ft stands, or, allowing 50 sec for breaking, setting back, and lowering the blocks, the stands can be set back in about 100 sec each, at rated depth. The average for the string will be about 80 sec per stand, and approximately 3 hours are required to come out of the hole from 12,500 ft.Referring to Table 1, the smaller rigs, if powered on a depth rating basis of 100 hp per 1,000 ft, also average close to 80 sec each to set back stands at rated depth. The rule of 100 hp per 1,000 ft permits hoisting drill pipe at these acceptable speeds. On any rotary-drilling rig, 1 min per stand going into the hole seems to be an established figure.A number of internal-combustion engines have been popular In the 011 Industry during the 20 years that power rigs have been gaining predominance most popular oil-country engines for powering medium- and heavy-duty rigs, and is a satisfactory basis for comparison when discussing the power requirements of rotary drilling.Referring to Table 3, a number of engines of about the same cubic displacement and rated speed have been popular on the heavier-duty rigs. When these engines are compared on the basis of 75 Ib bmep, for most practical purposes it seems that each can be considered as producing about the same power. In fact, it has been convenient to refer to most of them as 300-hp engines , and, on most drilling-rig applications, these engines are called on to produce power at the rate of 300 hp, a t least momentarily, when picking up the drillpipe loads.",,American Petroleum Institute

Davis(Shell Oil Co.),,,,,,API-49-112,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"For the first time in oil-field history, rotary drilling with a percussion tool has been accomplished for sustained periods of time through extended intervals of formation. The key to this successful operation is a simple mud engine placed directly above the drilling bit. Operation of this percussion tool and development of suitable percussion bits are described briefly. Rotary percussion-drilling technique, including the effect of weight on the bit and rotary speed upon performance in various formations, is discussed. A detailed summary is presented which outlines performance obtained m drilling almost 13,000 ft of hole by rotary percussion methods. Experience thus far is insufficient to define fully the capabilities and limitations of this method of drilling. Hard, friable chert sections, containing up to 100 percent chert, can be drilled faster than by conventional drilling methods-with increased footage per bit. Where crooked-hole conditions prevent carrying normal weight on the bit, rotary percussion drilling can increase penetration rates in hard or medium-hard formations. Present proved usefulness is limited to these two cases, but further improvement of the percussion tool and the development of more efficient bits may well lead to extending the scope of application of this method of drilling.INTRODUCTIONThe idea of rotary percussion drilling is not new. For more than 40 years inventors and individuals closely connected with rotary drilling have been studying and experimenting with devices to add percussive blows to the regular rotary drilling action, as evidenced by patents issued as early as 1902. Of all the various types of rotary percussion tools tried out to date, the Bassinger tool, discussed in this paper, is the only one that has operated down-the-hole long enough to give a substantial amount of actual drilling experience with the method. Still other types of such tools are now being developed and tested, and the oil-well drilling industry may not have to Walt much longer before rotary percussion drilling will be commonly practiced under certain limited conditions.Most, if not all, of the experimenters believe that the rotary percussion method will find its best application in drilling very hard chert formations, wherein present conventional rotary-drilling methods have proved very slow and very expensive. Our experience to date tends to confirm this view with the exception that i t h a s also proved a decided advantage when either hard or medium-hard formations are drilled through, where conventionally drilled holes go crooked unless they are drilled with very light weight on the bit and, consequently, with relatively poor penetration rates. As a matter of fact, however, very little is known about what actually constitutes the best drilling action when many of the various kinds of hard and medium-hard formations encountered in oil wells are penetrated. It is the view of the authors of this paper that much more study and experimentation, both in the laboratory and in the field, will be required before any reliable conclusions can be reached s to how widespread or how narrow will be the use which ultimately may be made of rotary percussion tools and the different types of percussion bits which may be required to accompany them.",,American Petroleum Institute

The results indicate that some of the present methods and equipment are suitable for such drilling operations. However, it was found that a large number of factors should be given careful attention and consideration before such a drilling program is attempted.

Many equipment limitations already have been reached in drilling the record wells of today, and it is becoming more and more evident that deep drilling-g is an exact science for which the equipment must be carefully engineered if it is to do a specific job. Although one rig has successfully drilled to more than 20,000 ft in one locality, drilling in different localities, as well a s completing a well a t that depth-all within a reasonable amount of time and expense-may offer a large number of problems which a s yet have not been solved.This paper reports the findings of a study group on deep drilling, which study was conducted under the auspices of the Houston Chapter of the API Division of Production, 16 meetings were held during a period of 6 months, and more than 150 representatives of the users and suppliers of oil-field equipment and services attended and participated in the study. Eight co-chairmen, consisting of a user and supplier for each of four main topics, presided over the meetings, and they were responsible for the development of the information presented herein.

A procedure for restoring original rock surface properties is presented, and results showing the properties is presented, and results showing the influence on oil recovery of both the method used for establishing initial water saturation and the saturation level attained are discussed.IntroductionChoosing the recovery methods best suited for production from a reservoir goes via laboratory tests production from a reservoir goes via laboratory tests using reservoir-rock samples.Generally, the state of core samples brought to the surface is not representative of their state in situ. Even in taking precautions immediately upon arrival at the surface so as to prevent any effect of the oxygen in the air or of evaporation, the core has undergone transformations with regard to the distribution and nature of the fluids it contains. This results from pollution by drilling mud and variations in temperature and pressure during the time it is being brought up. Physics-chemical changes may be made in the solid-fluid interfaces by adsorption-desorption or even a deposit of the heavy constituents of the oil, e.g. asphaltenes, or salt contained in the water.Generally speaking, the wettability of the rock will be changed by a reduction in its affinity for water or by an increase in its affinity for oil.The sample then has to be cleaned so as both to restore the original state of wettability and to put fluids back in place with their original distribution. Yet the composition of fluids and thermodynamic conditions are known to govern its wettability. Therefore, operations must be done with fluids and under conditions found in the reservoir.This paper will successively describe a method for restoring the original state of wettability and then the influence of the initial fluid saturation process and of the saturation level on recovery by process and of the saturation level on recovery by different mechanisms.PROCEDURE FOR RESTORING ORIGINAL SURFACE STATE OF PROCEDURE FOR RESTORING ORIGINAL SURFACE STATE OF ROCK SAMPLESThe importance of the surface properties of a rock on its behavior during various laboratory experiments has been well known for a long time.So-called &quot;preserved&quot; samples are often used. They are obtained by taking various precautions concerning the choice of mud, the use of special coring methods, the quick protection of the core sample as soon as it arrives on the surface, etc. Nonetheless, while it is being brought up to the surface, a decrease in temperature cannot be avoided, and pressure maintenance is not standard practice. Therefore, it is, a priori difficult to assert that the surface state of the so-called &quot;preserved&quot; rock has not been altered.In order to solve this important problem a method capable of clearing up this uncertainty has been developed for restoring the original surface state.Description of the methodIt consists in comparing the wettability of the rock upon reception and after restoration so as to justify either the direct use of the samples received or the application of a treatment for restoring the original surface state. A schematic diagram of the method is given in Figure 1.The restoration procedure first consists in cleaning the samples so as to make them as water wet as possible by flooding carefully chosen solvents.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers

Chaney(Sun Oil Company),,,,,,API-49-145,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"A new theory is proposed to account for the existence of abnormal pressures In hydrocarbon or saltwater reservoirs This theory leads to the conclusion that, In completely sealed reservoirs, abnormal pressures up to the overburden pressure are more likely to occur than is the so-called normal pressure. The relationship between abnormal pressures and lost circulation during rotary drilling discussed, and the mechanics of lost circulation compared to that of Igneous intrusions. On this basis, certain apparent fallacies in present practices aimed at regaining lost circulation are discussed.INTRODUCTIONAbnormal pressures and lost circulation combine to form the most serious handicap to deep drilling in the Gulf Coast area. Many theories have been offered to account for the existence of abnormal pressures, but none of these seems to explain completely the existence of abnormal pressures in this area.In presenting this new theory as to the source of abnormal pressures, it is realized that the supporting data are inconclusive, and that they are qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. However, the variety of data suggesting this explanation seems sufficient to justify its presentation. The author feels that the causes of abnormal pressure and the mechanics of lost circulation must be understood before a satisfactory solution to this serious problem can be evolved.Definition of Abnormal PressureThe so-called normal fluid pressure to be expected at any given depth has been defined as a pressure equal to the hydrostatic head of a column of salt water from sea level to that depth, which is equivalent to a pressure gradient of approximately 0.465 psi per foot. Any pressure in excess of 0.465 psi per foot is considered abnormal. The upper limit of abnormal pressure is established by the earth pressure gradient, which is considered by Cannon and Sullins1to Le approximately 1.0 psi per foot. No fluid pressure in excess of this gradient has been encountered or is to be expected. In view of the fact that it is almost never possible to circulate muds weighing more than 18.0 lb per gallon (0.936 psi per foot), it seems likely that the earth pressure gradient is somewhat less than 1.0 psi per foot.Source of Abnormal PressureMost presently accepted theories as to the source of abnormal pressure have been evaluated by Watts2in his discussion of the abnormal pressures in the D-7 zone of the Ventura Avenue Field. Watts has demonstrated that most of these theories are not applicable, at least to this particular case, because they depend upon a sequence of events in the life of the reservoir which contradict the known geology of the region.Of all these theories, Watts could only say of the best that it was the one most difficult to refute This negative statement has encouraged the author to suggest a new explanation for the existence of abnormal pressures.",,American Petroleum Institute

Smith(British-American Oil Producing Co.),,,,,,API-49-155,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"Bottom-hole pressure buildup data can be obtained either from fluid-level measurements or from subsurface pressure-gage readings. With these data, it can be shown that a simple hear relationship exists between the rate of pressure bull. up and the actual pressure. A straightforward linear extrapolation of this relationship on coordinate paper provides a simple and practical method for determining the static bottom-hole pressure The proposed linear extrapolation method is most valuable for wells with a relatively low productivity Index in which an abnormally long time is required for the well pressures to become static. Further, this method should be used only under well conditions such that single-phase flow is approached with no free gas entering or leaving the well bore during the buildup period.lMathematical proof is given that, with time intervals between pressure observations held constant, actual pressure increments(in pounds per square inch per day or per hour) can be substituted for the true rate of pressure buildup which would otherwise have required accurate determination of pressure increases over very small time intervals. After plotting these pressure increments m pounds per square inch per hour or per day against the pressure either at the beginning or at the end of each time interval, the resulting straight-line relationship can be extrapolated to the horizontal pressure axis to indicate the effective static bottomhole pressure. Examples of the practical use of this method are illustrated with data from wells In Wyoming and elsewhere. Also a comparison is made between Muskat's semi-log extrapolation method and the hear extrapolation method.When a producing well is shut in, the pressure in the well bore opposite the producing formation will generally begin to rise, rapidly at first and then more slowly, until finally a maximum is reached. This maximum is commonly called the static bottomhole pressure, and will be reached when the pressure in the well bore is in equilibrium with the pressure in the surrounding formation. Knowledge of this static bottom-hole pressure is essential in reservoir engineering work, and these pressures are also used, to a great extent, for reserve estimates and proration purposes.Unless the productivity index is relatively high, it is not always feasible or practicable to shut a well in long enough to allow the pressure to reach equilibrium; and, in such cases, the static bottomhole pressure must be calculated or estimated from a series of pressure observations during the allotted shutdown time. It is obvious that, if this can be done in a simple and reliable way, the shutdown time may be considerably shortened, and appreciable savings made in downtime and lost production.The bottom-hole pressure data obtained during the buildup period can be utilized to arrive at the static bottom-hole pressure by various extrapolation methods, some of which are well known from earlier publications1,2on this subject, and therefore will be reviewed only briefly together with the mathematical background.",,American Petroleum Institute

Brinkley(The Carter Oil Co.),,,,,,API-49-166,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"Two methods of computing ultimate condensate recovery by natural pressure depletion are presented. The recovery can be estimated if only the Initial produced gas- oil ratio is known, or may be computed more precisely for an individual condensate-bearing gas. The first method is based on a correlation of reservoir volume factor and of recovery percentage with gas-oil ratio. The second method consists of calculating incremental gas production per unit pressure drop from a closed reservoir and the condensate recovery per unit volume of gas production-the combination of these two factors to yield the rate of condensate production per unit pressure drop and, finally, the summation of the condensate-production increments as the cumulative condensate recovery. In addition, the determination of optimum separator conditions, and the computation of gas-oil-ratio history of natural condensate production are reviewed.Although many aspects of condensate recovery by pressure maintenance have been reviewed in the technical literature, the calculation of natural recovery by pressure depletion has not been stressed. A knowledge of the recovery which can be secured by natural depletion is important, not only for fields which actually are produced by pressure depletion but also for evaluating prospective pressure-maintenance projects. Two methods of predicting natural ultimate condensate are presented. One is a rough approximation which requires only, the. original produced gas-condensate ratio; the second is a detailed calculation which utilizes all the pertinent reservoir data for a specific condensate bearing gas.Full evaluation of both stock-tank and plant recovery is possible by the second method, which gives the composition of the separator gas as well as the stock-tank liquid recovery. The condensate recovery is expressed in barrels of stock-tank liquid recovered by pressure depletion from one barrel of reservoir pore space originally occupied by condensate-bearing gas. In this article the proportions of stock-tank condensate liquid and accompanying produced gas are reported ?as gas-oil ratio, in cubic feet per barrel. Other terms often used are barrels of condensate per million cubic feet of gas and gallons of condensate per thousand cubic feet of gas.Estimation of Natural Condensate Recovery from Gas-oil RatioA general relationship between dew-point pressure and gas-oil ratio of gas-condensate mixtures has been observed by several investigators, and also a relationship between bubble-point pressure and gas-oil ratio has been reported.1,2,3,4These are combined In Fig. 1, which shows consistent trends for both oils saturated with gas and gases saturated with condensate liquid.Inasmuch a s the saturation pressure of gas-condensate systems is a function of the proportions of gas and condensate, the reservoir volume of a unit volume of stock-tank condensate in the saturated condensate-bearing gas also is primarily a function of the gas-oil ratio. This relationship, (F1g. 2A) forms the basis for the estimation of natural condensate recovery.The approximate method of computing condensate reserves is based on two empirical relationships developed from actual reservoir fluids, and requires only the original gas-condensate ratio for estimation of ultimate condensate recovery, in barrels per barrel of reservoir pore space.",,American Petroleum Institute

In Wyoming a boom in oil activity occurred during the 6 years from 1942 to 1947, with 41 new fields discovered and 23 new producing horizons developed in old fields. At Elk Basin oil has been produced for approximately 35 years, but it was not until the latter part of 1942 that oil was discovered in the combined Embar-Tensleep formations. With the increased crude oil demand of the last war, this reservoir (which lies partly in Montana) became the greatest producer in either of these two states.A study of the Elk Basin Field indicated that pressure maintenance would materially increase the ultimate production of crude from the Embar-Tensleep reservoir. Subsequently, in May 1946, with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, the 29 working interests unitized the Embar-Tensleep and all lower potential horizons and made Stanolind Oil and Gas Company the operator. The unit agreement provided that a development and operating program be established for the more proper conservation of the unitized substances, and a part of this program required the maintenance of reservoir pressure by the injection of natural or inert gas, or water.Detailed engineering study indicated that shrinkage of casinghead gas, when compressed and sweetened-even without extraction in a gasoline plant-would be so great that the residue gas alone would not provide adequate pressure maintenance. Inasmuch as neither sufficient water nor outside gas were economically available, the injection of inert combustion gases from a boiler into the reservoir was considered the most favorable means of pressure maintenance. In September 1946, the Embar-Tensleep Operating Committee of the Elk Basin Unit authorized the preparation of engineering plans and specifications for a pressure-maintenance plant. In June 1947, the design was approved and construction authorized for a plant: 1, to produce 14,000,000 scf per day of boiler flue gas suitable for injection into ,the reservoir; 2, to process 12,000,000 scf per day of casinghead gas for the production of plant fuel and the recovery of liquid hydrocarbons and sulfur.

405,320951,,Performance of Hydraulic-type Rod-pumping Units in the Santa Fe Springs Field,Juan P. Pedretti(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-49-191,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"The performance of hydraulic-type rod-pumping units is discussed from the standpoint of the principal design features of the units, and typical dynamometer cards are shown. Comparisons are made between the performance of the hydraulic units and that of the previously installed beam-type units.INTRODUCTIONPumping equipment for oil wells, in the past, has been largely designed around the combination of a crank and a walking beam. Early equipment was an adaptation of cable-tool drilling equipment. Modern portable pumping unit shave evolved from the standard rig by the substitution of reducing gears for the belt and band wheel, and the utilization of electric motors or high-speed internal-combustion engines as prime movers. The motion of the prime mover, however, is still converted into polished-rod stroke by means of cranks and a walking beam.Throughout this development there has been a definite trend toward the use of longer stroke lengths. This trend has resulted not only from the desire for greater pump displacement, but also from the desire to minimize rod, pump, and unit failures by utilizing slower speeds. Speeds between 17 spm and 25 spm, which were at one time commonly used in the oil fields, are now considered excessive by most production men. The increase in stroke lengths of beam-type pumping units from 12 in. on the early jacks t o 12 ft on the larger modern pumping units has made it possible to lift larger volumes of oil and water, reduce peak loads, minimize sucker-rod failures, and increase volumetric efficiency when gassy fluid is being produced.In many California oil fields the water content of the production is increasing while fluid levels are declining, necessitating the pumping of larger volumes of liquid from greater depths in order to maintain economic rates of production. These factors make it advisable to resort to longer stroke lengths in order to minimize the troubles usually associated with large volume pumping. Since the use of a hydraulic system to transmit energy from the prime mover to the polished rod seems to offer a convenient method of obtaining almost unlimited stroke lengths, units embodying this principle have found a ready acceptance in certain areas. In the Santa Fe Springs Field, for Instance, there are approximately 45 hydraulic-type rod-pumping units which operate at stroke lengths from 10 to 26 ft. From the standpoint of operating it seems likely that stroke lengths in excess of 26 ft may prove feasible.Although experience with hydraulic-type units has been relatively recent, it was felt that sufficient data could be obtained at this time to make possible significant comparisons between the performance of these units and that of the conventional beam-type equipment. In order to eliminate uncertainties resulting from the variations in behavior between wells, the wells studied were .those in which beam-type units had been replaced by hydraulic types. On this basis an attempt was made to compare maintenance and repair work on rods, tubing, pumps, and units under both methods of operation.",,American Petroleum Institute

The gas-injection project was started when the reservoir pressure had declined to about one-half of its original value, for the primary purpose of increasing ultimate recovery and for sustaining higher production rates under good operating practice. Injection and production have both been maintained at relatively high rates, with decline in reservoir pressure kept to nominal values. Recently operations have been changed to maintain the current reservoir pressure. The operation of the project and the effects obtained are discussed. Particular attention is directed to the problem of bypassing of gas and to the measures employed to cope with this problem.INTRODUCTIONThe West Coyote oil field is located about 20 miles east of Los Angeles, in Sect. 13 and 24, T.3S., R.11W., and Sect. 18 and 19, T.3S.,R. low., SBB and M t. T he field was discovered in 1904, but the deepest of the 6 production horizons, viz., the Emery zone, was not discovered until January 1930, when Emery 43-A well was brought in flowing at a rate of 750 bbl of oil, and 1 bbl of water, per day at a gas-oil ratio of 390 cu ft per bbl. The pool had been produced by natural depletion until the middle of 1944, when a gas-injection project was started.DESCRIPTION OF RESERVOIRStructureThe West Coyote oil field is an elongated anticlinal structure about 21/2 miles long and 3; mile wide. The Emery zone is encountered at depths ranging from 5,000 to 6,000 ft. A transverse fault, which has proved to be a barrier to migration, separates the zone into two principal pools, the western one of which is known as the Emery West Pool. As shown in Fig. 1, structural contours of the Emery West Pool are regular, with f1aI;k dips of 16 to 18 deg. The pool is bounded by the previously mentioned transverse fault on the east. A longitudinal fault, believed to be a barrier to migration, establishes the northern boundary. The westerly and southerly. productive limits are defined by the oil-water contact. The pool has a productive area of about 250 acres.Sand CharacteristicsThe reservoir rocks are of the Repetto formation of the Lower Pliocene age. The zone is somewhat lenticular, with interbedded fingers of sand and shale, as shown in Fig. 2, which presents the electric log of a typical centrally located well. Although major sand bodies are persistent, some individual sand fingers cannot be correlated farther than several locations. The productive measures are about 800 ft thick in the central and northern areas, progressively thinning as the western limits are approached. The sands are clean and fairly well consolidated, and they range from 60 to 360 ft aggregate net thickness in well-bore exposures",,American Petroleum Institute
407,320953,,Effect of Permeability on Recovery Efficiency by Gas Displacement,W.O. Keller(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co..)|G.W. Tracy(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.)|R.P. Roe(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-49-218,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"The effect of permeability on recovery efficiency by solution-gas displacement is analyzed by theoretical calculations of well-production histories. Two general hypothetical situations are considered. The first situation is evaluated on the basis of 11 specific cases involving hypothetical wells completed in a single zone of uniform permeability and thickness. The second situation is analyzed for 7 specific situations in which 4 segregated uniform zones are simultaneously depleted through a common well bore. The analysis of cases involving a single uniform zone indicates that the recovery efficiency is a unique function of capacity (expressed in millidarcy-feet) wherein all other variables affecting recovery efficiency are held constant. In general, the recovery efficiency increases with capacity; however, for the specific conditions analyzed, the recovery efficiency does not. vary appreciably for capacity values m excess of 500 rnillidarcy-feet. The calculated data involving the simultaneous depletion of four zones indicate that the recovery efficiency is not a unique function of capacity, but is influenced by the permeability-thickness distribution. Simultaneous production of several zones of different permeability results in unequal rates of depletion of the various zones, the more permeable and thicker zones being depleted at much higher rates. In general, the recovery efficiency for zones of low permeability is increased for the same capacity because of the existence of other producing zones. Calculations presented herein for simultaneous production of several zones are based upon the limiting assumption that there is no communication between the various zones except through the producing well bore. Even under this extreme assumption, for permeability values in excess of 5 millidarcys, the results (for the situations analyzed) indicate only a slight variation in recovery efficiency with permeability for the individual zones. The calculated depletion histories for both single- and multiple-zone completions indicate that appreciable oil can be recovered from reservoir rocks having permeabilities as low a s 0.1 millidarcy. Stratification of zones of different permeability, separated by an impervious strata, can cause a serious deviation in the calculated performance history from the performance which would be predicted using the material-balance steady-state method, and assuming uniform permeability distribution. Predictions of the reservoir performance for solution gas-drive reservoirs, using the material- balance method, should take into consideration spatial variations in saturation conditions caused either by the existence of zones of different permeability or variations in the stage of depletion already in the reservoir. The results and conclusions are quantitatively limited to the specific conditions evaluated and assumptions employed in the analysis; however, it is believed that the data are of a sufficient scope to permit generalization as to the effect of permeability, thickness, and permeability-thickness distribution upon the recovery efficiency of a depletion- type reservoir.INTRODUCTIONThe effect of permeability upon the ultimate recoveries from solution gas-drive oil reservoirs is a subject of considerable interest to the industry, yet little has been published to clarify this relation.",,American Petroleum Institute
408,320954,,Interpretation of Core-analysis Results on Cores Taken with Oil or Oil-base Muds,Ward M. Edinger(Production Engineering Laboratories),,,,,,API-49-229,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"A review is given of the effects on core-analysis results of those fluids which enter and leave cores when oil and 011-base muds are used during coring. Comparisons are made with similar effects when water-base mud is used during coring, with emphasis on displacement of interstitial water. A material balance is made of fluids which enter and leave a core during coring operations, and semi-quantitative methods are outlined for the evaluation of the cha characteristics of the observed saturation In terms of the actual conditions. Typical analyses are given in which are shown specific effects of permeability, solution gas, and contamination by extraneous water. Comparisons are made between states of depletion noted in core samples and known states of depletion. Cases are cited wherein gas caps and watered-out conditions have been identified by oil coring techniques.Although the advantages of coring with oil or oil-base mud are well-known with respect to maintenance of initial productivity by means of the elimination of the swelling of certain types of matrix, interpretation of core-analysis results under these circumstances needs clarification. It is the purpose of this paper to present factual data and to attempt interpretation in the light of the author's experience.Certain general considerations may be reviewed at this point. Coring with oil or with oil-base mud is similar to coring with water-base mud to the extent that an alteration of fluid saturation and saturation distribution may, and usually does, occur. Regardless of the zero or low filter-loss properties of any mud, both laboratory and field experience has shown that such is the case. In water-base mud coring the oil saturation is usually reduced to the irreducible minimum at bottom-hole conditions, and the connate water is diluted or displaced to some extent with the mud filtrate. The foregoing statement needs qualification with respect to mobility index, or the ratio of the permeability to oil to the absolute viscosity of the oil at bottom-hole conditions. It may be shown that low mobility indices tend to minimize contamination. Table 1 shows the results of analysis of cores taken with water-base mud and rotary tools. The oil saturation of 78 percent and the water saturation of 17.4 percent in relatively high-permeability sand are not surprising in view of the bottom-hole viscosity of 800 centipoises, or a mobility index of 0.54 millidarcys per centipoise. Core analysts who assert that residual-oil content i s a measure of oil reserves are frequently referring -to circumstances analogous in some degree to the foregoing instance. Such instances represent trivial c a s e s of the more basic situation wherein the conditions just described do not exist and, for that reason, a reconciliation must be made. Oil or oil-base mud coring, properly conducted, leaves the connate water intact and, therefore, provides a ready means of determining connate water. Although connate water can be determined or estimated by other methods, oil coring provides the simplest means.' Thus, the alteration resolves itself into changes in residual-oil saturation and/or changes of voidage, as compared with water-base mud coring, which process involves the further alteration of water saturation.",,American Petroleum Institute

The West Pampa Repressuring Association cooperative gas-injection project IS unique and of special interest, in that it is the first and largest program of its kind ever attempted in a dolomite reservoir. The entire history of the organization of the West Pampa Repressuring Association, from its tentative organization in 1943 to the time actual operations commenced. is presented. From the time gas injection actually started, in the spring of 1946, the complete performance history of the gas-injection project is given, with an evaluation of the progress and results to date. The project, which contains 1,000 wells, is of such magnitude, and it covers such a large portion of the Panhandle Field, that any experience gained should be generally applicable to most of the Panhandle brown dolomite reservoir. In spite of the fact that the project has been in operation less than three years, there has been a substantial gain in gasoline, butane. and propane earnings as a result of the increased gas production. Currently these monthly increased liquid-hydrocarbon earnings are more than paying for the cost of the project. The normal oil decline of 18 to 20 percent per year prior to repressuring has definitely been retarded, and oil production has exhibited a sustained uptrend for the past 19 months. The current rate of production is 12.000 bbl per day, or some 5,000 bbl per day in excess of the expected normal decline. However, credit for approximately half of this gain is attributed to a remedial and acidization program, in addition to a few new wells which have been drilled. Produced gas has steadily increased, until it has reached a level in excess of the past peak performance under primary methods of operation. No so-called channeling of the injected gas has developed, and a high degree of efficiency of the Injected gas is indicated by the fact that the produced gas-oil rat10 has shown only a very nominal increase and the gasoline content of the produced gas has not dropped appreciably. Much credit for the results obtained to date is attributed to the input-well density of 1 injection well per 6.2 producing wells and to the reasonably moderate rate of gas injection, which averages 122 Mcf per well. The project i s highlighted by: 1, the systematic method by which it was organized and by which it has been operated; 2, the contracts which are very thorough and specific, and which have set the pattern for several similar projects already formed or under consideration; and, 3, the most unusual and high degree of cooperation which exists among all the oil producers and Ule gasoline-plant operators involved.INTRODUCTIONDefinition and Objects of RepressuringThe term 'repressuring literally means the restoration of pressure, either in full or in part.

Calhoun Jr.(The University of Oklahoma),,,,,,API-49-260,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"By the use of techniques which have been previously presented in the literature and by further extension of such techniques, calculations have been made on the behavior of a water flood. These calculations include the prediction of the amount of water injected into the intake wells on the flood, and the amounts of oil and water produced from the flood. information for the calculations was available on a large number of cored wells. These core data were used to arrive at such quantities as permeability, of permeabilities throughout the cored wells was utilized to give a measure of the successive production of oil and water in the producing well, on the assumption that flooding occurred in a horizontal plane only. The calculated values were found to compare favorably with the actual lease figures. The method of calculation is suggested as a possible routine approach to water-flood problems.It has been recognized by petroleum engineers for many years that the heterogeneity of a formation plays an important role in determining its economic floodability. It is important to be able to predict the effect of heterogeneity from basic data prior to the initiation of a flood. The object of this report is to give calculations on the performance of a water flood which show how this effect can be evaluated. The calculations are based upon core data, a knowledge of the operating pressure, and a schedule of well completions, which information is generally available or decided upon before a flood is initiated.On a water-flood operation it is axiomatic that the removal of oil is directly dependent upon the water which can be injected into the formation. This idea promoted the development of a prediction of water-intake rates by Yuster and Calhounl. In that report it was suggested that the injection data could be utilized to predict oil recovery, but the numerical calculations were not carried out. In other presentations Yuster2,3gave the elements of the oil-recovery prediction in further detail. However, nowhere in the literature does a complete presentation of the method exist. From a different standpoint, Stiles has also given a prediction of the floodability of a heterogeneous formation.Both Stiles' method and that used here are based upon the assumption that the displacement of oil by the entering water occurs in a piston-like fashion. Both require the knowledge of a residual-oil saturation below which the formation cannot be flooded. Both methods assume that flow through a heterogeneous formation can be represented by the sum of the flow through a number of individual beds separated from one another and flooded horizontally with no crossflow. Stiles' approach is based upon a previous knowledge of the actual amount of water to be injected, and requires the assumption of uniform flooding conditions in all beds. The method to be used here, on the other hand, permits a prediction of the water injection from core data and pressure data and can consider different saturation conditions in every unit bed. Although the latter alculation .is somewhat more tedious, in the example to be presented the results would appear to warrant the extra effort.",,American Petroleum Institute

The production performance of wells completed with various liner types are compared by average production-decline curves, grouped according to the type of liner, in areas in which producing conditions were comparable. The study was conducted on a statewide basis. A total of 769 wells was examined, including about one-third of the total number of wells in the state completed with gravel-pack liners of each type. Principles established from this study, as well as the methods and equipment which have shown the best record of field performance, are summarized under the conclusions. Field-performance results are also compared with design principles established by previous laboratory investigations. Factors which contribute to well-bore plugging effects which usually result when sand control is imposed by sand-control liners, are analyzed in detail. Measures which have been taken to counteract and reduce the plugging effects of sand-control liners are discussed. The results of well-washing methods, usually the most practical and economical method of counteracting plugging effects, are presented from an investigation of 182 wash operations m the Los Angeles Basin. Average production increases and payouts are shown graphically for well groups-segregated by liner type, by wash fluids used, and by areas. The percentage of success by number of well operations which have been conducted also are shown for the same well groups. A discussion of well-washing techniques is included.INTRODUCTIONMany California oil pools occur in unconsolidated sand beds. These beds are usually found in the shallower zones (4,000 ft or less); they contain heavier gravity oils (25 API or less); and usually have silty , clayey sands interbedded with incompetent shale bodies. The unconsolidated nature of the sands and their consequent production with the oil frequently cause sanding of the pumps and liners, collapse of liners, and enlargement of perforations by abrasion. When sand control is imposed, a plugging action frequently takes place in the well bore-which may reduce the production rate to marginal limits without adequate depletion of the reservoir adjacent to the well. The and expense resulting from these conditions are of major consequence to the operators of wells completed in these zones.A great deal of effort has been given to the solution of the problems which these unconsolidated sands present. Published material of rather extensive laboratory investigations has established the fundamental principles involved. Field investigations of particular fields have been made and published in the literature.Much still remains to be understood concerning the design and operating characteristics of the sand-control liner types and their practical applications to field problems. It has been the hope of the writers that this analysis of field performance of wells, on a statewide basis, would broaden and extend the scope of previous investigations. A total of 769 wells, including 428 with prepack gravel liners, 175 with pump-pack gravel liners, and 166 of sand-control liner types other than gravel pack, was covered during the progress of this investigation.

Caudle(The Atlantic Refining Co.),,,,,,API-49-302,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"&gt;Earlier works have indicated that relative permeabilities are markedly dependent on the saturation, and more recent studies show that the spatial distribution of the phases at a given saturation which will depend upon the mechanism used in introducing the second phase Into the system is also a definite variable. Three important mechanisms, viz, capillary-pressure displacement, dynamic displacement, and solution-gas displacement, are recognized. In the capillary-pressure displacement method the core IS held In a pressurized rubber sheath. Porous diaphragms in capillary contact with both ends of the core conduct the flow of the wetting phase; while Bow of the non-wetting phase is through openings in the diaphragms. The sample is desaturated stepwise by successively increased gas pressures. The flow rates are measured at each saturation after the system has reached equilibrium, and after the relative permeability values have been calculated. Theoretical considerations Indicate that a porous sample with an even distribution of capillary sizes would give relative permeability curves quite similar to those reported for unconsolidated sands. However, naturally occurring sandstones usually have uneven size distribution, as can be seen from typical capillary-pressure curves. This unevenness results in deviations from a smooth relative permeability curve. Curves for porous media are shown for oil-gas, for oil-gas and connate water, and for water-gas systems. It is concluded that relative permeabilities are unique for each capillary system and desaturation method, and that results obtained by one method can be applied only with reservations to calculations of field performance for reservoirs in which the type of depletion does not correspond with the method used in the laboratory. This paper presents an apparatus and procedure for the capillary-pressure method of measuring relative permeability.INTRODUCTIONRelative permeabilities are fundamental for the analysis of reservoir problems which concern the effect of various production procedures on recoveries. They are needed for any analysis of natural depletion, natural water drives, water flood, gas injection, or gravitational drainage. There are many difficulties, such as the effects of changes in fluid properties at reservoir conditions and of inhomogeneities in the reservoir medium, which must be worked out before laboratory measured permeabilities can be used at face value for field calculations. This paper will be confined to:The probable effect of the desaturating mechanism on the observed relative permeability.The reference value used to define the relative permeability ratio.A description of a capillary-pressure type of relative permeability apparatus, and a discussion of some of the data obtained.EFFECT OF DISPLACEMENT MECHANISM ON RELATIVE PERMEABILITYFrom the earlier work in this field1,2,3the marked dependence of relative permeability on saturation is readily apparent. The results of more recent studies suggest that the location, or, more particularly, the spatial distribution of the phases within the porous system, determines to a great extent the ability of a particular phase to flow. Moreover, it is conceivable and highly probable that the spatial distribution of a second phase which enters the capillary system will depend upon the mechanism used for its introduction. On this basis, it is highly suggestive that the method , used to introduce a second phase into a core specimen may have an appreciable effect on the observed relative permeability of the resulting system at a",,American Petroleum Institute

The method makes use exclusively of data derived from the resistivity and SP logs. It is based, first, on the determination of an empirical relationship between water saturations in the uncontaminated formation and in the invaded zone, and, second, on results from field experiments regarding the relationship between SP deflections and the resistivities of mud and formation water. Several actual examples of the application of the method are described.INTRODUCTIONThe fundamental relation for the quantitative study of electrical logs, as given by Archie1,7is : (Formula available in full paper)A great amount of work has been done which shows that this relation is usually correct when all of the porosity is effective.

Van Wingen(Petroleum Technologist Inc.),,,,,,API-49-329,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"Injectivity-index data are a useful guide in we planning and operational phases of fluid-injection operations. While they can be computed prior to the instigation of actual injection operations on the basis of fundamental-flow theory considerations, experience in two high-pressure gas-injection projects Indicated that, when existing wells are Involved, they could be established more readily and with greater accuracy by reference to prior observed productive ability as measured in terms of pounds of hydrocarbon material produced per pound per square inch of drawdown. For those instances in which it may not be feasible to use a depth-pressure recorder In order to establish an injectivity index, the following equation has been derived for the purpose of computing bottom-hole pressure from surface tubing-pressure data(Formula available in full paper):INTRODUCTIONThe availability of adequate injectivity-index data is essential in the planning stage of a fluid-injection project in order to ascertain whether individual well injection volumes, as indicated by reservoir-analysis studies, can be handled at economically feasible injection pressures. Pressure information is also desirable in order to properly design compressor-plant facilities.Once a project is in operation, it is desirable to follow closely injectivity-index trends of the wells. For example, when such data are used in conjunction with other pertinent information, they will give an early indication of plugging of the sand face, thus making it possible to perform remedial work at a time when it is most likely to be successful. injectivity- index data will also indicate readily whether or not the entire sand section or only a portion thereof is taking fluid.Injectlvlty-index PredictionsRadial or spherical flow formulas can be used to compute injectivity indices if certain basic reservoir- characteristic data are known. One of the prime difficulties involved in such a procedure, however, is the establishment of reliable effective permeability data. This difficulty can be overcome to a certain extent by utilizing specific productivity indices, as observed when the wells were producing, for the purpose of analytically deriving there from effective permeabilities. At best, however, this entire procedure is tedious and time consuming, and, because of assumptions which have to be made such as the determination of the drainage radius the final result is often questionable. As a matter of fact, for a number of high-pressure gas-cap Injection projects, this analytical procedure was found to give results which were obviously out of line, a fact which was further substantiated by subsequent actual well performance.In view of the foregoing considerations, other empirical means have to be resorted to in some instances. One procedure which has been found useful in a number of projects where existing wells were to be used for injection purposes involves the use of a mass productivity index. In this measure of well productivity per pound square inch drawdown, production is expressed in terms of pounds of hydrocarbon material produced, instead of the conventional barrels of oil or thousands of cubic feet of gas.",,American Petroleum Institute
415,320961,,New Chemical Treatment of Flood water for Bacteria and Corrosion Control,Joseph N. Breston(Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Assn.),,,,,,API-49-334,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"Two years of testing in the Bradford laboratory of the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Association has developed a new method of chemically treating flood water for bacteria and corrosion control. The treatment involves the use of a single organic chemical in concentrations of 1 ppm to 6 ppm for effective elimination of red, black, or turbid water which ordinarily would be dangerous from the standpoint of plugging an injection well. These chemical compounds belong to the broad classification alkyl and aryl high molecular-weight mine salts and certain condensed ethylene oxide-amines. They are relatively non-toxic and non-corrosive liquids which readily dissolve in water, and they can he handled by ordinary chemical feeder pumps. Certain of these compounds are compatible with oil-field brines, and show promise of applicability in brine flood waters which are air-free. Although they are most effective in air- free waters, preliminary tests indicate that they are also very effective bactericides in fresh waters which contain considerable quantities of dissolved oxygen. The chemicals available on the market as commercial products, and the chemical cost of treatment as applied to the Bradford-Allegany Field flood waters, should not exceed 0.6 mil per barrel. Besides the low cost of chemicals, such treatment should be very economical because of the very small amount of equipment required. Inasmuch as many of these potential bactericide- corrosion inhibitors have strong surface-active properties, they should be valuable in cleaning out Intake wells and also in increasing the permeability of the sand to water.INTRODUCTIONThe role which bacteria play in water-flood operations has been widely reported1,2 3,4,5, and numerous observations may be cited which indicate that bacteria are very effective in plugging the sand faces in water-input wells. This plugging causes a gradual, and often a rapid, decline in the water-injection rate and this ,in turn, is reflected in lower oil-recovery rates. Treating with chlorine, copper sulfate, phenol derivatives, and the like is very useful in minimizing the bacteria problem, but for permanent treatment the concentrations of these bactericides have to be raised to the point where secondary problems arise, such as corrosion by too high a concentration of residual chlorine. Slug feeding of sodium hypochlorite5is very effective in cleaning out bacteria-infested lines and water-injection wells; but most often the effect is not sufficiently permanent, and follow-up treatments are necessary.Similarly, acidic corrosion of pipe and other equipment could seriously hamper the efficient operation of a water flood. Besides leak trouble and the cost of replacing lines, slight aeration of such acidic water causes a precipitation of the products of corrosion which, if carried into the injection well, bill plug the face of the sand. However, it has been noted6,7,8that clay-containing sands have a higher; permeability acid water than to neutral or slightly alkaline waters. Thus it has been considered desirable to treat the water for acid corrosion without raising the pH. Another advantage of the acidic flood water is the inhibiting effect it has on bacteria multiplication, especially in the presence of certain organic bactericides.",,American Petroleum Institute

The method used was based on the procedure previously reported,1in which corrosion protection was determined by weight-loss data on steel coupons, bacteria count, and visual examination of water used for flooding. Satisfactory control has been obtained when the Inhibitors are used in the range of 1 to 10 ppm. Depending upon the type of water used for flooding fair to excellent protection was achieved. Leases on which flood waters contained hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide were found to be well adapted to the use of amine inhibitors. Slightly less effective results are reported on leases which are being flooded with water containing dissolved oxygen. However, the results on both of these flood waters were considered satisfactory, and an expansion of this treatment is now under way. Negative results were obtained on one lease in which the pH of the flood water was adjusted to 4.0 and 5.0.INTRODUCTIONIn a previous paper on this subject a detailed description was given of a method of evaluating corrosion inhibitors which were added to secondary flooding waters. It was pointed out that several factors influence the economic picture for obtaining oil by water flooding. The type of water used, maintenance of the pipe distribution system, and the condition of the water introduced into the oil sands have a major effect on the amount of recovered oil. The earlier work indicated that rosin amine D acetate was an effective bactericide and fungicide. In view of the fact that a number of the leases owned by Quaker State Oil Refining Corporation had no type of water treatment whatever, it was decided to expand the investigation of rosin amine D acetate and similar substances to determine their effect on the growth of organisms in the water systems. It has been recognized for some time2,3,4that there is need for some type of water treatment which will reduce organic growths and, at the same time, eliminate corrosion. It was also felt that any material which would accomplish the foregoing purposes would automatically reduce the turbidity of the water, thus providing a more satisfactory water for flooding.Since publication of the Breston and Barton paper, late in 1947, we have continued to expand the use of the fundamental principles which they reported in an attempt to determine the value of corrosion inhibitors in the several types of water which exist in the Bradford Field. This variation in water type has included such things as high dissolved oxygen, high hydrogen sulfide, high iron, and relatively high salts content-all of which have specific corrosive effects on iron pipe. It has also been the purpose of this current work to attempt to correlate the water treatment used with the effect on the oil recovery after a period of continuous feed of several months.During 1948 several field tests were made which used a water-soluble salt of a modified rosin amine, supplied as a 70-percent-solids paste, manufactured by the Hercules Powder Company, Wilmington, Del. Late in 1948 evaluation was begun on Pur-0-San, a quaternary ammonium salt supplied as a 10-percent , solution in water and made by the Pur-0-San Company, Bradford, Pa.

These indicate a neutral plane above which the drill stem is in tension, and below which compression exists because of the buoy-ant action of the drilling fluid. Experiments are described which establish the validity of the stress and strain equations. The work of G. H. Handleman is presented to show the effect of buoyancy on the drill stem.INTRODUCTIONThe rising cost of the production of oil has turned attention, probably more than ever, to the necessity of investigating the various operations associated with oil production, in the hope that more economical methods and devices will be found. Drill-stem failure, and its consequent expense, is one of the drilling problems which has received considerable study. It is the subject with which this paper is concerned.EquationsConsider a drill column which is suspended by slips in a well filled with fluid, where the bit is exerting some force on the formation. On any horizontal elemental ring (Fig. 1-A) of thicknessdt, at a depth of 1 ft from the surface, 4 significant forces act to give rise to axial strain in the drill pipe, viz.: 1, the force caused by the weight of the pipe and drill collars which hang beneath the element; 2, the force which is exerted upward by the formation against the bit; 3, the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid which acts horizontally against the inner and outer walls of the pipe; and, 4, the hydrostatic force which is exerted upward at the lower end of the drill column, against the effective cross-sectional area of the drill pipe. A fifth force, i.e., one which arises from the viscous drag of the circulating fluid, has been found to be small in comparison- with the others, and is complex. Therefore, this force will not be considered herein.With respect to buoyant force, some have held to the theory that the buoyancy of the drilling fluid is distributed throughout the length of the column as though a chain were suspended in a fluid. The experimental work described herein is largely the result of the controversy which arose over this theory, and from this work it is concluded that the buoyant action of the drilling fluid is localized at the lower end of the drill column.From Hooke's law, and from the lateral contraction. law developed by Poisson, it can be shown that the strain in a unit cube subjected to 3 mutually perpendicular stresses (Fig. 1-13) is given by: (Formula available in full paper)The location of the neutral strain plane may be found by solving equation (6) fort, when exis set equal to zero.

However, an area-wide cooperative program to gather performance data and evaluate results should allow consistent improvement of all types of lease tankage.INTRODUCTIONApparently the matter of obtaining satisfactory petroleum storage has been a problem since the discovery of petroleum production in this country. In discussing this matter with various individuals, some had heard stories of the early days of oil production, when it was the practice to store and transport the oil in wooden barrels. Because of the business aptitude of some purchasers, the size of these wooden barrels gradually increased, until it became apparent that the producer was suffering huge losses because of this practice of constantly increasing the size of the so-called barrel. This may have been the reason for the standardization of the now accepted barrel of 42 gal. Another reason may have been the practice of adding 2 extra gallons to the 50-gal average-capacity wooden barrel in order to make up for leakage.Just as it became necessary to set a standard unit of measure for crude oil, it also became necessary to standardize the type of vessels used to store this fluid. As a result of this demand, the American Petroleum Institute has, as we are all well aware, set up standards of material and fabrication or construction. These standards are now accepted by both the manufacturer and the consumer of lease storage tanks in all the oil-producing areas within continental United States. Naturally; these standards must be revised from time to time in order to maintain the highest level of efficiency. Even then there are questions which cannot be answered by any set of standards, and these questions must be considered in the selection of the equipment which is to be used to store crude oil, on the lease and elsewhere, particularly in the Permian Basin area and other similar areas.When lease production tanks or other storage equipment for use in the Permian Basin area is selected, there are more problems to, consider than probably exist in any other area. Practically all of the production from that area contains hydrogen sulfide. A large percentage is accompanied by salt- or sulfur-water production, both of which are contributory to extreme corrosion conditions. Much of this water contains scale-forming elements which add to the difficulties of operation of treating equipment and in some instances, even the clean-oil storage equipment.

Hebard(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-49-381,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"The present API 8 round-form thread tubing joint was not specifically designed for handling the severe conditions of tensile load, internal pressure, and corrosion which are encountered in deep high-pressure wells. A review of the history of its development reveals that it is merely a modification of an earlier API joint. Field experience and fundamental test data show that the 2-in. API joint offers an inadequate seal at high pressures. Test data also show that excessive hoop stress is imposed on the 2-in. API coupling when the joint is made up with the 2,000 ft-lb torque required to approach an effective seal. The desirable features of an ideal heavy-duty tubing joint include: 1, an effective and dependable seal; 2, adequate tensile strength; 3, rapid rate of makeup; 4, positive control of the amount of makeup; 5, a minimum number of threaded connections; 6, freedom from galling; 7, internal-flush joint; 8, ruggedness; 9, an economical means of compensating for wear; and, 10, a streamlined exterior. The important features of four special heavy-duty tubing joints are presented. The conclusion is reached that some of these can be used with assurance that they will satisfactorily withstand the most severe of well conditions.INTRODUCTION.One object of this paper is to review briefly the major design changes and improvements which have been made in oil-well tubing joints since 1924, the year when the American Petroleum Institute inaugurated ICS work on standardization of oil-field equipment. A second object is to present the basic features of recently developed tubing joints which were designed to handle satisfactorily the severe conditions of pressure and corrosion which are encountered in the deep distillate wells of the Gulf Coast area.Highlights in the Development of the API ThreadVarious changes have been made at different times in the API specifications for oil-well tubing to meet the gradual increase in tensile load and internal pressure which result from increased well depth. The very constructive committee work of the American Petroleum Institute has been carried on jointly by the oil-production engineers and the manufacturers' engineers. The tubing difficulties encountered and the corrective measures adopted for these difficulties are a matter of record in the API annual proceedings. Some of the more important changes are mentioned herein because they are interesting, and because they portray the history of the present API tubing joint.Prior to 1926 some manufacturers furnished either 111/2 or 10 sharp (V) threads per inch on upset tubing, depending upon the preference of the purchaser. The first API specifications for oil-well tubing were established in 1926. They included both regular and external-upset, with 111/2 sharp threads per inch on a 33/4-in. taper for the 11/4-, I1/2-, 2-, 21/2-, and 3-in. regular end, and 10 sharp threads per inch on the 11/4-, 11/2-,2-,21/2-, and 3-in. external- upset end. The following year the 31/2-in. regular and 31/2-in. and 4-in. external-upset tubing sizes were added to the standards, with 111/2 threads for the regular and 10 threads for the upset. These additions were caused by the extensive use of gas-lift in the Mid-Continent fields, particularly in Seminole. The larger sizes were used in tapered or telescoped flow strings.",,American Petroleum Institute
420,320966,,Economics of Oil-well Corrosion Control,Robert J. Villagrana(Standard Oil Co.of California)|William W. Messick,,,,,,API-49-391,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"The paper indicates that oil-well corrosion can be economically controlled with present methods, and suitable ways of controlling the various types of corrosion are discussed to the extent of local experience. The importance of maintaining complete records for an evaluation of operating costs before and after corrosion treatment is explained, and typical examples of such records are reviewed. The mechanism of establishing a self-supporting corrosion-control program which will Insure continuous protection for oil wells is outlined.Corrosion is a waste broadly defined as destruction of metal. However, to the oil operator, this waste is immediately translated into excessive cost and breakdowns on his wells. These costs aggregate considerably more than the value of the metal products. destroyed by corrosion. Every oil operator has seen many. Example of corroded rods, tubing, pit holes, and eaten-up pumps which clearly demonstrate to him the significance of corrosion. Furthermore, most oil men realize, at least in part, the magnitude of well-pulling and material-replacement costs. The purpose of this paper is to help combine these past observations into an overall picture of the more important physical and economic aspects of corrosion. It is hoped that results gained from experiments described herein will prove a useful tool for oil operators.Our ultimate purpose is to apply effective and economical means of controlling the corrosion of producing equipment in oil wells. In order to attack this problem in a systematic manner, it is first desirable to be familiar with the common types of corrosion and some of their causes. Second, the possible effective means of control for various types of corrosion should be reviewed. Finally, a program should be set up to maintain control once it has been established. To produce such a control program, a good record of the economics involved is essential because, in the final analysis, the best criterion for judging effectiveness of corrosion control is the net saving being secured. This cost information can be kept, as this paper will show, by use of data from actual field trials.Large amounts of money and effort have been expended by the petroleum industry in recent years to combat corrosion of metal, for the tremendous annual economic loss more than justifies all such trouble and expense. Some work has been done on the extension of applicable theory, but the major portion has been toward development of practical corrosion-mitigation methods. In this development work the oil operator is often working on a t least a partial cut-and-try basis. Generally accepted theories of corrosion phenomena are of considerable help as a guide, and are constantly being enlarged and improved; but the most significant recent developments are the result of field trials. Therefore, the authors believe that the problems and results in starting and maintaining an oil-field corrosion-control program may well be of Interest to production people in general.",,American Petroleum Institute

Corless(Standard Oil Co.),,,,,,API-49-407,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1949,"The depression of the '30's, war, and other causes have resulted in a bad break in the age distribution of executives. Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) has undertaken to correct this. Jersey applies the same principles of management to selecting and developing executives which are practiced in the physical and financial phases of its business. These include forecasting, planning, organizing. and control. The steps for initiating a systematic program are outlined, and some of the means used for developing executives are describes.The progress made by the oil business during the past three generations is outstanding in American industry. This progress could not have been achieved without a high quality of leadership Executive selection and executive development-informal perhaps, but effective nevertheless-have never been lacking. Mr. Rockefeller, Sr., recruited many of his executives by buying successful companies and then giving jobs to the former owners. This practice is no longer feasible. There are too many companies and too many people in the business. Thrift plans and pensions make for career employment. Income taxes take away much of the incentive to change employers for more money. Promotion from within for salaried people is almost as deeply grounded as seniority at the wage-earner level.The oil companies seem to accept the fact that they must build with the material at hand. The trade journals list page after page of items about promotions, transfers, and shifts of personnel. But, as one reads about his friends and acquaintances, he cannot help wondering whetherthistransfer orthatpromotion is the result of long-range planning to bring out the latent talent you believe he has or merely a move to meet some crisis by plugging a hole in the organization setup.What the Term Means.Executive development is a term to conjure with. Tile first time I saw it was five years ago on a conference program, and for three days I waited to be enlightened. The fact that it was passed over for more practical topics is significant, considering; the present keen interest in the subject. Witness the success of management institutes sponsored by the American Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, in which the training-within-industry techniques have been carried to high levels of oil- field management.It may have been unfortunate for its acceptance that Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) called its plan for a more systematic approach to managerial succession as A Program for Executive Development. The word executive connotes 'brass, and for a long time executive development was top secret. The first talk I gave about it was reported in a magazine which was distributed to supervisors. From the furor it caused, one might think that I had released the markers on a tight well. In time executive development came out of the hush-hush class, and is now openly accepted as a routine of management. Some companies have adopted the title management development which, in many respects, I like better. management implies organization , as well as personal leadership. Besides, there are many more managers than executives; therefore, the target is larger and more easily recognized by the men down the line.",,American Petroleum Institute

Horn(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-50-112,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"A blowout in oil- and gas-well drilling operations may be defined as that loss of control over formation pressure which causes an unrestrained flow of mud, oil, gas, or water at the surface accompanied by potential injury to personnel, loss of hole or equipment, or other appreciable damage Sixty-six well blowouts involving 30 companies and operators have occurred in California drilling operations during the 10-year period 1940 through 1949. Histories of 55 wells were sufficiently complete to permit a study of drilling practices preceding the blowouts. these have been analyzed from the standpoint of determining causes of such blowouts and their relative significance. Based on this investigation, some precautions are suggested for preventing the uncontrolled flow of formation fluid which results in well blowouts. The causes of well blowouts are as follows:PrimaryReduction in fluid level by lost circulation.Insufficient drilling-fluid density.Reduction in static pressure by pipe withdrawal.Failure to keep hole full of fluid.SecondaryInsuHicient blowout control equipment.Improper design or fabrication of blowout control equipment.Improper installation of blowout-control equipment.Improper surface fittings for blowout-control equipment.Improper well-casing program and cementing practice.INTRODUCTIONBlowout! is a dangerous and expensive accident in oil-well drilling operations. Several excellent papers have been published on the general subject; but, except for articles on spectacular individual wells, no previous general survey has been made concerning the subject of blowouts in California. A blowout in oil and gas-well drilling operations may be defined as that loss of control over formation pressure which causes an unrestrained flow of mud, oil, gas, or water at the surface accompanied bypotentiallinjury to personnel, loss of hole or equipment, or other appreciable damage.In practice, however, this definition of a well blowout has not been applied to the present investigation. In many cases, to the author's knowledge, some drilling fluid has been momentarily blown out of a well, but immediate use of blowout control equipment or continued circulation prevented complete loss of control over the formation pressure; hence prevented actual injury or damage. Therefore, the blowouts reported herein are necessarily limited to those which actually resulted in injury to personnel, loss of hole or equipment, considerable consternation, or other serious situations. These are the accidents which attract publicity and remain in the memories of drilling people.Drilling operations considered in this study include the drilling, redrilling, or deepening of new wells or former producers; and the necessary completion perations for testing or producing from objective horizons.Sixty-six well blowouts involving 30 companies and operators have occurred in California drilling operations during the 10-year period 1940 through 1949. During this decade approximately 18,000 oil and gas wells were drilled. Including all exploratory operations and limiting the development operations to those fields in which blowouts were actually experienced, these 66 well blowouts took place during the drilling of approximately 7,550 wells. This amounts to 0.8 percent. Of the 66 blowouts, 34 occurred in drilling development wells, 29 occurred while drilling exploratory wells, and 3 were unspecified as to time or location (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).",,American Petroleum Institute
423,320969,,The Use of Tubing as Drill Pipe,W.F. Bates(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-50-129,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"Considerations given to the selection of light-weight tubes in lieu of heavier drill pipe are discussed. Experiences using tubing as drill pipe are given, as well as detailed analyses of comparable drilling progress and costs. lt is concluded from experience to date that in many instances drilling costs can be reduced by the use of tubing in place of drill pipe.As an integral part of the continuous effort to reduce well costs, the Pacific Coast area staff of Shell Oil Company undertook a study of slim-hole drilling. These studies were conducted to determine optimum hole and drill-pipe sizes and included such factors as circulating rates and pressures, mud flush, rising velocity and availability of suitable sidewall sampling, fishing and testing tools. Because theoretical and practical considerations were strongly in favor of the 64-in. hole using 34-in. drill -tubes, this combination was accepted as a basis for slim-hole operation.Studies of possible drilling units that could be moved legally over California highways led to the conclusion that equipment designed to handle 10,000 ft of 34-in.. drill pipe did not exist; and, furthermore, that it was extremely unlikely such equipment could or would be built for some time. However, it was recognized that existing portable equipment could be used to drill deeper if the drill pipe loads could be reduced. Further studies along this line, which included a review of experience with acme-thread drill casing used for drilling in the Ten Section Field, led to the selection of 9.3-lb 34 1/2-in. J-55 API upset tubing with acme-type threads for the drilling of 6 3/4-in. slim holes .A portable drilling unit powered with a 150-hp diesel engine was available for testing the practicability of using tubing for drilling; and it was reasoned that inasmuch as this unit could successfully handle loads equivalent to 3,500 ft of 4-in. 16.6-lb drill pipe, its depth range could be extended to 6,500 ft through the use of 9.3-lb tubing as drill pipe .The selection of 9.3-lb tubing was based primarily upon availability of an API standard tube, plus the fact that 24-in. tubing had been successfully used in drilling-in operations in the Ten Section Field. Therefore, it was believed this tubing would have the ability to transmit the necessary torque required for rock-bit drilling. Grade J tubing was preferred to grade N because it has more resistance to shock, as indicated by elongation specifications.Acme-type threads were selected because they had been used so successfully in drill-casing operations in the Ten Section Field and also because this type of thread could be obtained without waiting for the manufacture of special joints. Also, it was believed that an inexpensive tool joint such as a tubing collar, if it could be used, would contribute materially to the economic success of slim-hole drilling. As experience with drill casing had definitely proveda, the desirability of using power tubing toags to spin up the pipe as it is run in the hole, andb, the necessity for using specially built tong jaws which would evenly distribute over a large area the crushing force developed while breaking out the tubing, this equipment was obtained before starting the drilling test.",,American Petroleum Institute

Ten percent of the current national oil production conies from deep wells in the lower half of the total productive interval, 7,500 to 15,000 ft; and 20 percent of these deep wells produce by artificial lift, including at least 65 wells with sucker-rod pumps actuated by hydraulic surface units, several hundred with beam units, and 410 with subsurface hydraulic pumps. One operator has pumped 275,554 bbl of oil at an average rate of 118 bbl per well day from 4 wells with pumps at 10,600 ft. Average direct cost for maintenance and repair of pumping equipment has been $0.17 per net (7/8) barrel, and ranges from $365 to $964 per well month. Both sucker-rod pumps and a subsurface hydraulic pump are in service, but conclusions as to their relative merits are premature in view of the experimental nature of the past operating period.INTRODUCTIONSteadily increasing producing depths are creating greater load demands on pumping equipment. Inasmuch as new developments in equipment have been made, a brief review of the capabilities of present equipment and number of installations operating at extreme depths is timely. In addition to such a review, reported herein is the limited experience of one operator in pumping from 10,600 ft with sucker-rod pumps and with a subsurface hydraulic pump.Deep pumping EquipmentIn recent years the maximum operating depth for sucker-rod pumps has been increased considerably as a result of improved rods and new developments in surface units. Subsurface hydraulic units also have been improved by new design features. Stronger sucker rods are now available in 85,000 psi yield point steel up to 1 1/8-in. size, and 96,000 psi yield point steel up to 1-in. rods. Conventional beam-pumping units with 12-ft stroke and 34,500-1b beam load rating, and air-balanced beam units with 10-ft stroke and 40,000-lb beam load rating are now manufactured. Several heavy-duty hydraulic surface units are available; the current largest unit has a 40,000-lb load rating and a 30-ft stroke. A comprehensive description of these hydraulic units1has already been presented, so will not be included here. Briefly, hydraulic sucker-rod units provide a long-stroke slow-speed motion and thus minimize rod stress. Long strokes permit small pump bores and slow speeds for a given fluid rate, thus reducing the fluid and dynamic loads and decreasing the number of stress reversals. These load reductions, in turn, may lessen rod-string requirements and thereby further decrease the total polished-rod load.Directly comparable performance of beam and hydraulic surface units in deep sucker-rod pumping is not available but may be computed with fair accuracy. Calculated load characteristics at 100 bbl per day for beam and hydraulic sucker-rod pumping units are illustrated in Fig. 1. Maximum pump setting depth is presently limited by surface unit capacity, but rod break frequency begins to rise sharply in the same load range; therefore, both rods and units must be further improved for any substantial increases in .economic pumping depths. The load curve as computed by Mills formula2agreed within 3 percent of the measured load on 2 tests of a pumped-down 10,575-ft well and was confirmed by several other tests at 7,300 ft. Prediction of rod break frequency is based on experience at lesser depths (Fig. 2) as adjusted for decreased stroke speed in the deep wells. The solid line represents best available rods, while the dotted curve shows the predict",,American Petroleum Institute

Hughes(Standard Research Institute),,,,,,API-50-151,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"Approximately one half of all the sediments of the continents consist of shales and clays, yet only within the past few years has the petroleum industry recognized their importance in its operations. Careful study of available geological information may permit one to surmise the kinds of clays encountered. Differential thermal analysis equipment and base-exchange measurements are recommended for their identification and classification. Such determinations in the light of present-day clay knowledge can be applied to improve practices in drilling, cleaning out, and completing oil wells, and to increase oil recoveries in both primary and secondary recovery operations.Krynine1has classified all sandstones making up petroleum reservoirs into three series, viz.: the quartzite or orthoquartzite series, the graywacke series, and the arkose series.The orthoquartzite series is composed almost entirely of well-rounded quartz grains cemented principally by silica. Orthoquartzite are usually clean and indurate. They were probably deposited during periods of geological quiescence which permitted chemical destruction and the carrying away of less stable minerals. Many petroleum reservoirs of the offshore-bar and shoestring types probably belong to this series. Extensive and thick petroleum reservoirs of this type are rare. The Ordovician petroleum reservoirs of the mid-continent area are said to be representative.The graywacke series of sandstones is composed principally of angular detrital grains of quartz, feldspar, and chert set in a matrix composed predominantly of clays and clay minerals. Mica, carbonate, and pyrite are often present. Graywackes are grayish to dark colored. They were usually deposited under marine conditions during periods in which erosion, transportation, and deposition were sufficiently rapid to prevent much sorting and chemical weathering. Extensive and thick graywackes characterize the Franciscan formation of California.Many dirty reservoir sands may be classified under this series. They are called low-rank graywackes by Krynine and are related to broad and gently subsiding geosynclines. The Bradford third sand and most of the Tertiary petroleum reservoirs of the Gulf Coast are of this type.Arkosic oil sands have been described by Krynine as ashy, light gray (or red), dirty sands with much feldspar. Cementing material is usually clay and sometimes calcite frequently loaded with iron oxide. Most arkosic sandstones accumulated rapidly as fan-shaped deposits during geological periods of major faulting and uplift of nearby granitic sources. They may reach great thicknesses locally, but their areal extents are limited. Many petroleum reservoirs in California are said to be arkosic sandstones.Geologists have estimated that approximately one half of the material making up the sediments of the continental areas of the earth may be classified as shales and clays.2They may occur either a s formational units, beds, and lenses of widely varying thickness, or as constituents of limestones and sandstones.It is not always possible to distinguish between shales and clays. Simple microscopic methods and chemical analyses are often misleading. Ordinary distinctions rely almost entirely upon particle-size determinations. Any sediment or portion of a sediment which shows bedding, cleavage, or fissility and in which over 50 percent of the mineral particles are between 0.06 and 0.004 mm in diameter is called a shale.",,American Petroleum Institute
426,320972,,Geological Interpretation of Dipmeter Results,A.P. Claudet(Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp.),,,,,,API-50-168,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"The interpretation of dipmeter results is sometimes puzzling and difficult, particularly in locations near salt domes or over other types of complicated geological structures. This paper presents a graphical method for general geological interpretation of the dipmeter results, which is proposed as an aid in subsurface correlation and studies. The method can be applied to both field and exploratory wells as an aid in the location of faulted zones, possible salt overhangs, and, in some cases, the relative position in space of the various fault blocks.INTRODUCTIONThe dipmeter technique and equipment have been described in detail in the technical literature.1This method provides a fast, simple, and accurate means to measure, in situ, the magnitude and azimuth of the dip of the formations encountered during the drilling of an oil well.2,3,4,The parameters used to obtain those data are:a, the self-potential, or S. P. curve;5,6andb, the resistivity curves7The basic technique consists of the simultaneous and automatic recording in a bore hole of 3 self potential curves or 3 resistivity curves, oriented in 3 different azimuths 120 deg apart inside the ore hole. A photoclinometer instrument is part of the dipmeter assembly.The differences in depth shown on the film between the curves recorded by each of the electrodes are easily measured.Knowledge of the orientation of the equipment and of the bore hole (obtained from the photoclinometer) completes the data necessary for the computation of the angle and direction of dip of the formation under investigation.The main advantage of the dipmeter is that it provides measurements in situ of the magnitudes and directions of the lines of greatest slope of the bedding planes over vertical sections of as much as 50 ft, thus giving an overall picture of a very long section of the hole contrasted to the very local information (a few inches) which may be obtained from cores.Proper Selection of the StationsThe selection of the stations, or lengths of borehole to be investigated, is of great importance in order to obtain the most reliable information.A study of the curves of the electrical logs indicates that in sand and shale sections, such as the Aliocene, the bases of the sands or the tops of the main shale beds generally present sharper changes in bedding than the tops of the sands. In other words, the anomalies shown by the resistivity or self-potential curves are generally sharper at the bases of the sands; for older formations the reverse is often true.However, the tops of the sands have in many cases given excellent results and, therefore, should not be excluded systematically from all sections. In some fields the tops of certain sands give results equal to the best obtained at the bases of other sands. In wildcat locations, however, the bases of sand sections should certainly be given preference, especially in the Miocene or younger formations. For older geological sections, the tops of the beds under investigation may be preferred.In some areas excellent and reliable markers are known to be present, and these should be included in some of the sections to be recorded. The choice of the sections should also depend upon the type of dipmeter instrument used.The self-potential dipmeter is limited to the recording of the boundaries of the permeable media.The resistivity dipmeter will record sections not only at the boundaries of permeable media, but also in any formation encountered in the hole. Sections can be recorded successful",,American Petroleum Institute

The location of points at which the buckled pipe is tangent to the wall of the hole Ad the force with which it contacts the wall are determined. The location of points of maximum stresses and the value of these stresses are also calculated. The inclination of he bit and of the force on the bit are investigated. Measures for prevention of buckling and for minimizing its effect are given. Essentially, these measures are carrying proper weight on the bit and/or the use of special drilling methodsINTRODUCTIONThe fatigue and failure of the drilling string have been a subject of numerous investigations; ? but, to the best knowledge of the author, no mathematical approach to the problem has been undertaken. In order to allow the conclusions of this investigation to be easily read by those who are not interested in mathematical developments, the derivation of formulas is given in an appendix. formulas is given in an appendix. Without weight on the bit, a drilling string is straight if the hole is straight. With a sufficiently small weight on the bit, the string remains straight. As the weight is increased, a so-called critical value of weight is reached for which the straight form of the string is no longer stable. The drilling string buckles and contacts the wall of the hole at a point designated as the point of tangency. If the weight on the bit is further increased, a new critical value is reached at which the drilling string buckles a second time. This is designated as buckling of the second order. With still higher weights on the bit, buckling of the third and higher orders occur.against the wall of the hole, and this causes caving in certain formations. The rubbing effect becomes worse when the force between the buckled pipe and the wall of the hole increases. When the buckled string is rotated, some reversing stresses are developed. These stresses increase with the diameter of the hole and result in fatigue failure of the string.As soon as a drilling string buckles in a straight hole, the bit is no longer vertical and a perfectly vertical hole cannot be drilled.This investigation attempts to find answers to the following questions :What are the critical values of weight on the bit at which buckling occurs?What i s the shape of the buckled string?Where are the points of tangency and maximum fatigue stress located?What i s the magnitude of the force between the buckled pipe and the wall of the hole?Under what circumstances are the stresses in a buckled string excessive?How great are the inclinations of the bit and of the force on the bit?li&gt;How may buckling be avoided; or, eventually, how-to drill to minimize the bad effects when drilling with a buckled string?Critical ConditionsA certain point of a drilling string is usually designated as the neutral point. In this investigation the neutral point is defined by the following conditions: The weight in mud of the portion of a drilling string below the neutral point is equal to the weight on the bit. &iquest;Each value of weight on the bit corresponds to a value of the distance between the bit and the neutral point. The critical values of this distance depend upon the type of pipe or drill collars and the specific gravity of the mud. It is very convenient to measure depths not in feet, but in a dimensionless unit in order to obtain the results independent of the type of pipe, collars, and mud.",,American Petroleum Institute
428,320974,,More Wells - More Oil?,H.H. Kaveler(Phillips Petroleum Company),,,,,,API-50-215,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"The paper presents conclusions regarding the effect of well spacing on ultimate recovery, based upon a study of more than 50 pools. Production statistics and related facts on 6 pools ate presented in substantiation of a general recommendation for wide spacing.INTRODUCTIONNo oil pool can be produced a second or a third time. A pool drilled, developed, and depleted with 1 well to each 10 surface acres cannot be restored to its native state and produced again to determine if 1 well to each 20 acres, or some other spacing, would result in ultimately the same, or more or less, oil recovery from the pool. The industry is denied the opportunity of repeating the production operation to obtain directly comparative experience as a means of learning whether the ultimate recovery from a pool is in any way dependent solely upon the number of wells drilled. The ordinary procedure of experimental science cannot be followed. For that reason, an indirect deduction from known fact and logical premises must be relied upon in appraising the problem.Nevertheless, it is a matter of great importance to the nation, to the petroleum industry, and to every owner of rights in an oil pool to know whether there is greater or lesser recovery of petroleum from any pool depending upon whether a greater or a lesser number of wells is drilled. Do more wells produce more oil? Are oil reserves lost because only 1 well is often drilled to each 40 acres rather than 2 or 4 wells to 40 acres? These questions have been before the industry a long time and have been answered by competent petroleum engineers in a number of excellent publications during the past 15 years.1The engineering conclusion is that other elements in the exploitation of any pool are determinative of the ultimate oil recovery; the number of wells drilled is not.In spite of this long-established engineering conclusion, persistent efforts are continued by some who seek to propagate the myth that more wells produce more oil. They are the advocates of close well spacing. Those who would like to believe the myth of close spacing of wells, or who would like others to believe it, are driven to the defensive cry that the logic of petroleum engineer fact is too theoretical for the (self-styled) practical man; and that the conclusions drawn from technology are not confirmed by experience.What, then, is experience? Those who advocate the drilling of many wells have never published comprehensive field histories containing specific examples of increased recoveries attributable to close spacing. Heroic addresses or the expert witness stand are the usual mediums for expounding generalized conclusions, alleged experiences,and purported scientific facts by those who advocate dense drilling as the necessary and essential step to the recovery operation. If experience is to be the ultimate test of fact, then if there be fact, the advocates of close well spacing should utilize opportunities to lay the full circumstance of experience before the industry. What does the history of oil pools reveal?The purpose of this paper is to present conclusions as to the effect of well spacing on ultimate recovery, resulting from a study of more than 50 pools. Production statistics and related facts on 6 pools as typical examples are presented. In each instance the number of wells in the pool has been increased either by in-fill drilling or by extension drilling. These are examples of pools that have been developed since production statistics and sub-surface information records have been kept with sufficient accuracy and detail to permit conclusions with respect to the relationship between ultimate recovery an",,American Petroleum Institute

The permeability of many of these cores to liquids, including petroleum fractions and salt water, was obtained. The experimental results have been correlated with theory; and, as a result of this study, general conclusions made for the interrelation between permeability of porous media to air, water, salt solutions, and non-reactive liquids, previously recognized by API Code 27 (2nd Edition) are substantiated. Consequently, this study provides data which are quantitative proof of the soundness of the theory underlying the behavior of fluids in porous media.INTRODUCTIONThe effect of fluid on permeability determinations is now well recognized in laboratories making such measurements. In particular, the high values obtained with air or other gases are a matter of great concern because of the convenience of using gases instead of liquids. In API Code 27 (2nd Edition), the relation between to air and permeability to liquid is generally recognized, as well as tile fact that the lower the permeability the greater the percent difference between the permeability to liquid and the permeability to air at atmospheric pressure.The difference between permeability to liquids and permeability to gases, in the absence of complicating chemical or electro-kinetic reactions, is almost entirely the result of a phenomenon known as slip, as was first pointed out to the oil industry by Klinkenberg.' Slip in flow of gases through small capillaries was pointed out by Kundt and Warburg2in 1875, and has been extensively studied by physicists and mathematicians. Reviews of this early work may be found in comprehensive texts on the kinetic theory of gases. Klinkenberg pointed out that, on the basis of theory and extensive experimentation, the relation between permeability to gas and permeability to liquid is given by the equation:",,American Petroleum Institute

Kieschnick(The Atlantic Refining Company),,,,,,API-50-247,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"It is proposed that the injection of gas into oil reservoirs at pressures much higher than those used with conventional gas pressure maintenance will result in considerably higher recoveries. This proposal originated from studies of gas-condensate systems. These studies led to the conclusion that a system containing appreciable amounts of hexane-plus components usually contains high concentrations of intermediates (approximately ethane through heptane). Calculations indicated that a high-pressure natural gas containing these intermediates would evaporate much larger amounts of a typical reservoir oil than a similar gas with low concentrations of these components. Experimental results of batch treatment of oil by gas at high pressure confirmed this. This work also led to the concept of reservoir volume ratio. This results from the enrichment of the treating gas, which, when subsequently mixed with the virgin oil, is highly soluble and swells the oil to many times its original volume. Experimental work on a dynamic system, in which reservoir fluid was displaced from a porous medium with gases at high pressure, showed that high recoveries could be obtained, up to approximately 90 percent of the oil in place. The recoveries are improved by:1, high pressures;2, high concentrations of intermediates in the injected gas; and3, undersaturation of the reservoir oil at the pressure of displacement. The added recovery of this process over that of low-pressure gas sweep seems to be absent below about 3,000 psi. The mechanism appears to be explained by the higher mutual solubility of the phases at the higher pressures wit11 the attendant effect of reduction in the difference in viscosity between the displaced and displacing phases. Also, with undersaturated oil the reservoir volume ratio effect is important.INTRODUCTIONIt is well recognized that gas injection-pressure maintenance will yield its maximum oil recovery if initiated early or at least before a reservoir pressure declines below saturation pressure of the reservoir fluid.1,3However, it has been pointed out that often economics demands a delay in beginning such a program.1,5,7In any event, increased oil recoveries at higher pressures are attributed to maintenance of optimum values of the reservoir liquid properties, viscosity, and formation-volume (shrinkage) factor.1,3developing these principles, discussions appearing in the literature assume either no change in the virgin oil (and injected gas) properties in the case of pressure maintenance, or a gradual deterioration with a pressure decline. The authors propose that the injection of gas at pressures significantly higher than those used in the conventional case will enhance these properties of both the virgin oil and the injected gas with resultant higher recoveries.A few remarks are in order relative to the concepts which led to this proposal. Several years ago attention was directed to the difference in concentration of heavy ends occurring in various condensate systems at similar conditions of temperature and pressure. In Table 1 are shown four condensate systems at varying temperatures and pressures. Contrary to expectations, the system with the lowest gas-oil ratio, system A, does not occur at the highest temperature and pressure. It was at first thought that this anomaly must be accounted for either by the fact that the high gas-oil ratio systems were not saturated or that the boiling range of the condensate was highest in the systems of high gas-oil ratio. When these two factors were studied they did not seem to account for the difference in concentration indicated.",,American Petroleum Institute

Masters(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-50-258,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"The authors present a summary of the production and gas-injection history of the Temblor pool in the Kettleman North Dome Field, Kings and Fresno Counties, Calif. The field is approximately 14 miles long, 2 miles wide, and has a closure of 2,000 ft above the oil-water contact and a productive area of approximately 16,000 acres. The Temblor Pool is composed of 5 main zones characterized by thick, lenticular sand sections and a wide range of permeabilities, which average approximately 131 millidarcys with a 0.8 variation factor. A total of 335 wells is involved in the project, and oil production to January 1, 1950 has totaled 335,900,000 bbl. The pool was discovered in 1928 and a volume equivalent to 66.8 percent of the gas produced since 1942 has been injected into the reservoir. After 7% years of operation under gas injection, the project appears to be successful. It is expected that the recovery of crude oil and other liquid products will be substantially higher than with conventional depletion practice. Other favorable aspects of the program are more uniform, sustained production rates and lower lifting costs resulting from the higher reservoir pressure.INTRODUCTIONThe Kettleman Hills consist of three anticlines: viz., North Dome, Middle Dome, and South Dome, which lie in echelon for about 30 miles along the west side of the southern San Joaquin Valley, trending southeastward from the Coalinga Nose. This paper is concerned only with North Dome which lies in Kings and Fresno Counties in T. 21 s., R. 17 E.; T. 22 S., R. l7 E.; T. 22 S., R. l8 E., M.D.B. M. (Fig. 1). As early as 1910 the Kettleman Hills were described by Arnold and Anderson1as possible productive territory. Several wells were drilled to test the shallower formations, but it was not until November 1928 that the first commercial well (Milham Exploration Company, Elliott One) was completed in the Temblor Zone on Sect. 2P. Initial production of about 4,100 bbl per day of 59 API oil and 77,000 Mcf per day of gas indicated a rich discovery.Development of the Kettleman ZonesAfter the initial discovery drilling by the various operators became very active, and a short time later 32 drilling strings were in operation. By agreement2,3on July 25, 1929, the Kettleman operators suspended all drilling wells after reaching the top of the Temblor until conclusions could be reached regarding several basic issues concerning development and production. This agreement continued until the end of March 1931, at which time the Kettleman North Dome Association (KNDA) was formed by unitizing government acreage in the field. Control and development of the field then was almost uniformly checker-boarded between the KNLJA, controlling all of the even-numbered sections, and the Standard Oil Co. of California, controlling all of the odd-numbered sections except for some acreage in Sect. 295, known as the Huffman area, and in and near Sect. 355, called the Felix area. Development proceeded rapidly in the low gas-oil ratio area of the north end offsetting the competitive Huffman area. Active development of the south end did not begin until 1937, 9 years after the discovery. By this time it was apparent that heavy withdrawals of oil and gas in the competitive area in the northern part of the field had caused a pronounced pressure sink, inducing migration of oil",,American Petroleum Institute

Botset(University of Pittsburgh),,,,,,API-50-270,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1950,"Several current secondary-recovery research problems are being investigated by the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Association in its Bradford laboratory, and in sponsored research at The Pennsylvania State College and Armour Research Foundation. These projects include studies on the effect of pore size upon recovery by water flooding, corrosion inhibitors, use of heated injection water to increase intake rates, study of directional permeability in sands and its effect on well spacing, development of a new shielded electrode for obtaining greater definition in electric logging, and a new method for studying the relationship between interfacial tension and flooding efficiency. The results thus far obtained on these problems and their significance in regard to secondary-recovery operations in the Applachian area are discussed briefly.There should be no necessity in the Appalachian area for justification of the value of research on secondary-recovery problems. This area is recognized throughout the industry for its significant contributions to understanding of the basic physical and chemical aspects of secondary recovery, as well as for the success with which these have been applied in practical operations.The ultimate objective of secondary-recovery research is , of course, the improvement of field operations in order that more oil may be produced economically. Sometimes those interested in the final results become impatient at the apparent puttering around over what appear to be insignificant details. These apparently insignificant details may be essential to the successful solution of the problem, inasmuch as all practical results must be based on a thorough knowledge of the fundamental physical laws and relationships involved in the various aspects of petroleum production. Therefore, when a problem is presented for research, if insufficient fundamentals are known, it is frequently necessary to establish these before proceeding to the so-called practical problem. A building is no stronger than its foundation, and an expensive and elaborate building resting on an inadequate foundation would not be a good investment. Hence, in any research problem the first consideration is the establishment of the fundamental relations. As in the case of a building foundation, these details may, to the average observer, be practically invisible in the final results.There is no point in a foundation if it is not to support a building, nor is an expensive foundation necessary for a cheap building of no permanent use. The practical field application of fundamental phenomena is analogous to the building. Therefore, research in the basic scientific problems must always be accompanied by consideration as to the ultimate practical goal being sought and as to the best method of applying the results economically. Many times this is a more difficult problem than that of developing the basic scientific data.For several years the Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil Association has been conducting and sponsoring fundamental and applied research on the problems of secondary recovery. In fact, the large amount of research and development work carried out by the association in previous years has been largely responsible for the successful application of secondary-recovery methods by the industry, not only in the Appalachian area but in all regions where fields have reached the secondary-recovery stage. In view of the increasing number of secondary- recovery projects being initiated throughout the mid-continent and the west, the value of the research already completed and that in progress is",,American Petroleum Institute

The studies leading to the installation of a pilot flood in 1943 are outlined. Reservoir characteristics, including oil and water saturations at the beginning of water flooding, are given for the Benoist. The water-flood development program, completion practices, and general operation practices are presented. The primary and water-flood performance for a few individual leases, as well as for the entire flood, are presented. Waterflood recoveries to date and estimated ultimate recoveries are also presented. The development costs, operating costs, and future economics are given. All data presented on the flood performance are factual.Field HistoryThe Patoka Field was discovered in February 1937 by the completion of Adams Oil and Gas Company and Felmont Corp. well 1 Meryman located in Sect. 21, T. 4 N., R. 1 E., Marion County, Ill. This discovery touched off the second oil boom in Illinois. About 100 acres of the field extended into the city limits of Patoka, resulting in prolific drilling of town-lot wells.The discovery well was completed in the Bethel sandstone, locally known as the Benoist, at a total depth of 1,418 ft. This well, which is one of the few that actually Bowed, initially produced 100 bbl of 39 API oil. Within less than a month the well was put on pump and pumped 135 bbl of oil per day after a 10-qt shot.The field was drilled on an irregular spacing pattern and 132 producers were completed with approximately 700 productive acres. The wells initiated from 40 to 150 bbl of oil per day, and a maximum field production of approximately 2,400 bbl per day was reached in January 1938. The production decline was very rapid, but was retarded to some extent by the completion of additional wells in 1940 and 1941.The wells were rotary drilled, and on most of them; the sand was cored with rotary. Casing was set on top of the sand and cemented with 200-300 sacks of cement. All of the early wells were completed with 5%in. casing but some of the later wells were completed with 4%-in. After cementing casing, cable tools were used to drill the plug, shoot, clean out, and put on production.Individual pumping units, powered with gas engines, were installed on most of the wells. Pull-off jacks, operated by second well attachments from the individual units, were installed on the remaining wells. In 1940, most of the field was electrified and power was furnished by a generating plant located near the center of the field, with natural gas used for fuel. The gas was gathered by a small rotary vacuum pump and vacuum system. The vacuum was automatically controlled and only enough was pulled to furnish sufficient gas for fuel.Varying amounts of salt water were produced from the wells located on the south and northwest edges of the field. The salt water was disposed of through open pits and a disposal well into an upper sand.Most of the wells in the town-lot area were edge wells with a thin productive sand section, and the majority of them were abandoned within two years after completion.",,American Petroleum Institute

The importance of proper design and care in handling is also stressed as fundamental in obtaining good collar performance. The possibilities of a seamless pierced drill collar are weighed and discussed. Examples and photographs of a large drill-collar manufacturing facility are examined in some detailINTRODUCTIONIn considering the metallurgical requirements of a given product, it is by no means unusual to discover that the designer or user is confident his problems are less capable of satisfactory solution than those in other fields. For example, those concerned with the service of tool joints, drill pipe, or wire rope all feel their difficulties are unique and need special steels and/or distinct methods of processing. In certain respects this is undoubtedly true However, there are fundamental principles which apply to all steel products, and, In many cases, the differences of which the user 1s so conscious on closer examination turn out to be basically alike to the metallurgist.Because of basic metallurgical similarity, betterments In one field can sometimes be translated to another. For example, an improvement made in a big turbine rotor shaft yesterday may turn up tomorrow as an advance in cold-strip mill rolls. The author has had some acquaintance with gun-tube manufacturing and heat treatment, and reference is made herein to developments in this allied field. In the writer's opinion there are close parallels, particularly because of them dimension and composition, between drill collars and cannon barrels, and it is logical to tie them together Because of the more intensive subsidized research on guns, it IS believed that the knowledge of this item is further advanced than that of collars. It may, however, Interest the user of drill collars to know that a properly made collar of today, if it were the right shape and dimensions, would pass the gun-tube requirements of World War II and would be acceptable for service by front-line troops.In examining the necessary requirements for oil- field Items, there is sometimes a break in the line of communications, and the metallurgist gets a false Idea of what the user wants or thinks he needs. It is necessary to know the illness before a medication can be prescribed. The reverse is also true, inasmuch as the designer or user is not always familiar with the latest developments in the scientific study of the properties of metals and alloys. It is the purpose of this paper to review the present processing of drill collars, with special reference to metallurgical factors which have a profound effect on their trouble-free serviceUse of drill collars in rotary-drilling strings has undergone a process of evolution by trial-and-error methods since early in the development of rotary drilling Of particular significance through the years has been the discovery that straight heavy walled tubular sections just above the bit are beneficial In two ways. First, the rate of drill penetration is increased, and second, the number of drill pipe failures is reduced.1",,American Petroleum Institute

Ludwig(Research Laboratories Universal atla Cement Co Buffington Ind),,,,,,API-51-020,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1951,"Thickening-time and strength tests show that the additions of sodium chloride markedly change the physical properties of two cements normally used in cementing oil wells in the range of 0 to 100,000 ppm, this salt decreases the thickening times and increases the early strengths in the range of 200,000 to 300,000 ppm, the thickening times tend to return to normal values whereas the early strengths become less than normal Extraction tests show that sodium chloride remains in solution in the liquid phase of portland cement for periods up to approximately 16 hours, and that then the chlorine slowly combines with the cement minerals to form a complex double salt.INTRODUCTIONThe investigation reported was undertaken to obtain data on the effects of sodium chloride on the properties of cement slurries , because this salt is sometimes present in relatively high concentrations in the waters used as mixing water in oil fields For example, in some off-shore locations it is difficult and expensive to bring fresh water to the job. Also, in locations where the well bore extends through a salt dome, large amounts of sodium chloride are sometimes added to the mixing water to minimize the action of the cement slurry in dissolving salt from the formation The concentrations, accordingly, may vary from those found in the waters along the Gulf of Mexico, 2,000 to 30,000 ppm1, to approximately that of a saturated solution of the sodium chloride, viz., 36.2 pts per 100 pts water at 86 F.

However, other materials (notably organic compounds) may affect the setting and thickening-time properties of cement slurries because of physical reactions such as adsorption Many sodium salts, when added to the cement slurry, will react with calcium hydroxide, which is readily available from the hydrolysis of the cement minerals, to form relatively insoluble calcium salts and solubleNaOH.

The analyzer repeats the entire history of reservoir performance cyclically at a rate of 250 times each second. The high repetition rate permits immediate observation and measurement of the effects of adjustments In reservoir parameters or production programs on reservoir performance. The basic electric analogy for a water-drive reservoir has been extended to include an analog representing a gas cap. No analog for solution gas is included, but the effects of this gas can be properly accounted for by special procedures. Several examples of reservoir analyses are presented, together with a description of operating methods. One analysis demonstrates the ability of the analyzer to predict accurately the latter part of the pressure-decline history m a reservoir, using the early part of the data to set up the analyzer. Methods for determining the probable accuracy of analyzer predictions are discussed.INTRODUCTIONThe fundamental problem of the reservoir engineer is to determine the available producing energies resulting from solution gas, free gas, and compressed liquids in the oil zone in addition to such energy resulting from the expansion and inflow of water, from without the oil zone.Hydrocarbon production is usually accomplished by a combination of the basic recovery mechanisms. Depending upon the particular reservoir configuration and the distribution of the energies of fluid compression, there exists an optimum combination of natural or artificial recovery mechanisms which will result in the most efficient exploitation. In order to determine the best combination of these basic mechanisms, it is conventional to mathematically determine the natural energy relationshipsThe complete mathematical approach to reservoir energy analysis has the disadvantage that basic knowledge of some significant reservoir parameters is frequently lacking This ,together with the extreme complexity of mathematical calculations, makes the application impractically tedious in handling routine problems Because of these severe limitations, there has been a concerted effort to simplify and possibly supplant the mathematical solution Most of these efforts have centered around the development of analyzers based upon the analogy between the flow of fluids through porous media and the flow of electric current through conductive mediaBruce1demonstrated the practicability of applying an electrical analogy to the unsteady-state solution of water-drive reservoir problems. The advantage of the analog lies in the possibility of immediate perception of the result of any change in parameters, and thus to converge by a cut-and-try process to a close representation of a relatively complex problem.The present development was directed toward the problem of securing maximum instrumental precision together with a high speed of response. This was attained by making use of a principle in analog operation which involves the repetition of the entire reservoir performance history many times per second. The method includes electronic techniques which were developed to take advantage of the fast repetitive operation in achieving high precision of measurement and control.",,American Petroleum Institute

The committee believes this information is of immediate practical use to the drilling industry. Various means of drilling straight holes in crooked-hole country were investigated. Essentially, these are1, the use of less bit weight than that which would cause the drill collars to buckle,2, the use of stabilizers properly located,3, percussion drilling,4, pilot-hole reaming,5, use of diamond and combination diamond-rock bits, and 6, directional whipstocking. Emphasis is placed upon the drilling of an original straight hole rather than the straightening of hole already excessively crooked.INTRODUCTIONAt its 1950 spring meeting, the Mid-Continent District API Committee on Drilling Practice authorized the formation of a Study Committee on Borehole Drift. During the year since its organization, this study committee has sought both theoretical and practical solutions to the problem of drilling straight holes in crooked-hole country. The purpose of this report is to present to the drilling industry information developed to date which the committee believes is of immediate practical use.MEANING OF A CROOKED AND A STRAIGHT HOLEAn early attempt was made to define a crooked hole, which was not too successful. An understandable confusion exists in the customary use of the terms straight , crooked , and vertical when applied to a drilled hole. A 3-deg hole might be rifle-bore straight if the deviation were all in one direction, but obviously far from vertical Such a straight but non-vertical hole would present little drilling or producing problem. A 2-deg hole could be more crooked if it swung sharply from 2 deg in one direction to 2 deg in the opposite direction several times throughout its depth. Although such a hole might be classed as vertical because the bottom of the hole would be close to a point directly beneath the surface location, it might have sharp, dog legs up to 4 deg at several places and develop relatively serious drilling and producing problems. It is apparent that angle alone is inadequate to a definition of a crooked hole, the factor of rate of change in angle must also be considered.A 2-deg hole following a tight spiral would be vertical but far from straight, and if it held steadily to 2 deg, there would be no objectionable rate of change in angle, yet the spiral hole might develop serious key-seating difficulties, drill-pipe wear on intermediate casing, etc. To guard against the development of this type of hole, the consideration of direction must be added to that of angle and rate of change. This complicates the situation because, while angle and rate of change may be determined from the customarily employed slope-testing devices, an instrument for the recording of direction is not normally employed as a routine drilling tool. For these practical reasons, the study committee has not yet been able to develop a universally acceptable definition of a crooked hole This subject is high on the agenda of future work.",,American Petroleum Institute

A graphical method of design is recommended and illustratedINTRODUCTIONMost of the principles involved in engineering design of casing strings were analyzed by Coberly1in 1929, but for some time thereafter such principles could not be applied effectively because of lack of dependable minimum strength data for casing. It was not until 1941 that considerable theoretical and practical investigation on the part of both the pipe industry and the oil industry culminated in publication by the American Petroleum Institute of minimum strengths of casing in collapse, tension, and bursting.2 though 11Today the engineered casing string is the rule rather than the exception, and the advantages of economy and safety by proper engineering design are generally recognized.This paper is a review and summary of the principles and practice of casing-string design and a discussion of means of choosing and utilizing the necessary data and assumptions It is hoped that the material will be of value not only to those who are new to the problem, but to those who wish to review the subject and evaluate their own practices A bibliography of previously published material is includedAs covered herein, the problem of the casing-string designer is to choose, for a given casing size, the combination of weights, grades, and types of joints which will meet drilling and producing conditions a t the least cost consistent with safety Pipe shortages increase the importance of avoiding waste, but indiscriminate reduction of safety factors and strengths is likely to result in waste not only of money and material but of manpower and oil as wellThe most important factor controlling the cost of a string of casing is the size. Factors governing this choice have been discussed in other papers12though16and are not reviewed herein, but Fig 1 can be used to compare the costs of casing strings of various sizes.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSCasing-string design on an engineering basis becomes increasingly important as well depth increases, and for very deep strings ,the weight of (fig.1 available in full paper)the casing must be held at a minimum not only to decrease cost but to provide safety intension. However, proper design should not be restricted to deep wells, for it will result in economy and uniform safety in wells of any depth.",,American Petroleum Institute

Francis(National Tank Company Tulas),,,,,,API-51-108,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1951,"The low temperatures obtainable from expansion of high-pressure gas streams can be utilized to a profitable advantage. The application of equipment designed for this purpose will increase the yield of the stock-tank liquid to such an extent as to afford a good payout investment, provide a gas for pipeline sales that possesses low water-vapor dew point and low hydrocarbon dew point characteristics. Data from full-scale performance tests and calculated studies are presented in order that this process can be evaluated.INTRODUCTIONThe increased demand for gas, an ideal fuel, has resulted In the construction of transmission facilities unprecedented In magnitude. With this development producers have entered an era in which natural gas production occupies a much more important position in their activities. Not too many years ago a gas discovery well was often regarded as being worse than a duster .Since the recent trend has been toward higher and higher gas transmission line pressures, the operators of these transmission facilities have found it advantageous to demand gas which is suitable for transportation in these high-pressure transcontinental pipe lines.The advantage of processing the gas delivered to the pipe lines as it leaves the producing wells has been a major contributing factor toward involving the gas producer in the activity of gas processing which has been previously carried out in large plants. This factor has been the impetus for the development of such related equipment as the packaged gas dehydration and packaged hydrocarbon dew point depression units.Low-temperature separation is another of the gas producers? tools which finds application in the high-pressure gas fields, usually referred to as vapor-phase reservoirs. In this process the low temperatures obtainable from the expansion of these high-pressure gas streams is utilized to a profitable advantage. A more efficient recovery of the hydrocarbon condensate and a greater degree of dehydration of the gas as compared to the conventional heater and separator installation is a major advantage of low-temperature separationThis process for extracting hydrocarbons from high-pressure gas streams at low temperatures is not new. It was carried out as early as 1936 (when gas markets were very limited) on both plant-size and individual well scales, complete with the formation and subsequent melting of hydrates. Packaged units are now available for this purposeDescription of the ProcessLow-temperature separation, In it present status of application, is accomplished in several different types of units in order to eliminate confusion and permit more detail, the discussion herein will be limited to one particular type of unit it will be easy to understand how modifications and variations of this particular unit may vary in accordance with the physical properties of the gas-condensate production for which the equipment is to be suppliedBasically, the successful operation of any low-temperature separation process which utilizes the high well-head flowing pressure to accomplish self refrigeration depends upon its forming hydrocarbon hydrates, then removing them from the stream and melting them under a hydrocarbon blanket, or using an inhibitor to prevent the formation of hydrates and removing the water mixed with the inhibitor from the hydrocarbon stream This discussion will be limited to the type unit which permits the formation of hydrocarbon hydrates and their subsequent removal in the form of liquid water (Fig 1).",,American Petroleum Institute

Monel collars are furnished to the trade on an engineering-service basis, and are supplied in more than 31 different types. They are used in drilling wells which are controlled within narrow limits, such as within specified cylinders or near property lines, and in holes that range up to 80 deg of angle Their use permits faster and more accurate surveys, reduces hazards, and decreases the cost of drilling directional or controlled oil wellsINTRODUCTIONApplication of the K Monel non-magnetic drill collar in surveying oil wells marks the greatest single advance in the art during the past decade. Its use has aided both the oil operator and the drilling contractor by providing a more accurate means of surveying, reducing hazards, permitting better drilling time, and lowering drilling costs1. The K Monel drill collar is a relatively new product which has undergone extensive development and design during the past several years until it is now a proved, established tool The primary purpose in using this tool is to provide a permanently non-magnetic section in the drill string just above the bit. A single-shot instrument may be go-deviled or lowered on a wire line through the drill pipe and landed in the collar at such a point that the compass of the single-shot instrument will be outside the range of any magnetic influence from the drill string A survey record made in this manner will show the true angle and direction of the bore hole. K Monel drill collars are usually of the same outside diameter as the conventional steel drill collars used in the drill string, and are equipped to use high-grade steel subs on either end. They are bored to take the conventional single-shot instrument and are adapted to either bottom-landing or top-landing methods of operation The positioning of the single-shot instrument in the drill collar by both methods is shown in Fig 1.HistoryThe first practical investigation involving the use of non-magnetic sections in a drill string for surveying or orienting purposes was conducted just prior to 1940 These early applications were concerned with providing a non-magnetic section in the drill string immediately above the bit by means of which deflecting tools could be oriented2.

The surges were found to be of an order which would indicate that they may frequently be a cause of loss of circulation.Observations Leading to Measurements of Pressure Surges Resulting from Pipe MovementsBecause of some particularly troublesome lost circulation difficulties in a number of wells drilled in 1948, Gulf Oil Corporation assigned a group of engineers to the general study of the problem The S S. Perry No 1 well at Peach Point had 45 separate losses of circulation, and it was decided that future operations in this area would be closely studiedObservations made during the course of drilling the S. S. Perry No. 2 well revealed that there were 22 instances of loss of circulation, and that of these, 3 were associated with balling of the drill collars, 6 with downward movements of balled collars, 5 with downward pipe movements alone, and 8 could not be associated with any apparent causeFollowing is a description of the methods through which this information was developed.The pipe was usually pulled from the hole after each loss, and balling was observed at the surface Otherwise, balling was detected from the drag occurring during pipe withdrawal to the casing or through the use of a pump-stroke recorder which showed a slowing of the mud pump as the ball formed. Also, it was observed that development of balling coincided with pronounced increases in viscosity of the silicate mud used.Pipe movements were shown to be an immediate cause of loss of circulation through the use of a pit-level recorder which was mounted on the rig floor. Although the purpose of this instrument was the detection of changes in mud volume, it was observed that vibrations of the drawworks during working of the pipe shook the recording pen of the instrument so that each sharp movement could be identified In the instances where working the pipe was associated with losses, charts similar to that of Fig. 1 were found where the pit level decreased immediately after a pipe movement.Another noteworthy observation was that in this field the hole almost invariably remained full after a loss of circulation, indicating that the formations in the area were capable of supporting required hydrostatic pressures. This was true even though mud densities as high as 17 5 lb per gal (131 Ib per cu ft) had been used This led to the conclusion that pressures in excess of necessary hydrostatic pressure, caused by balling and pipe movements, were breaking down the formation after which the circulating pressures were sufficient to cause the formation to take mud. It was believed that if the pressures could be kept near the required hydrostatic pressure, then losses could be prevented.",,American Petroleum Institute

The pool was drilled up rapidly, and by January 1947 the reservoir was fully developed. A total of 201 wells were drilled of which 184 were producible. On May 1, 1949, the 27-B Pool was unutilized with the Standard 011 Company of California as operator. Development and early production performance indicated the presence of an original gas cap in each of the two domes of this anticlinal structure. The producing mechanisms which characterize the performance of the 27-B Pool are gas-cap expansion, gravity segregation, and partial water drive. Relatively high-angle dips, good permeabilities and favorable fluid characteristics have made gravity drainage and gas-cap expansion particularly effective On August 1,1949, 3 months after unitization, gas injection was started. Gas injection and edgewater encroachment have effectively maintained and increased the pool pressure As a result, flowing pressures have been maintained and the cost of purchasing, installing, and operating artificial-lifting equipment has been deferred In many structurally low wells and probably eliminated in several wells higher on the structure. As of January 1, 1951, the pool had produced approximately 66,189,000 bbl of oil at a cumulative gross gas-of ratio of 473 cu ft per bblINTRODUCTIONThis paper presents a historical coverage of the 27-B Pool from the date of discovery to January 1, 1951, with particular attention directed to pool performance before and after gas injection.The 27-B Pool is located in the Buena Vista Hills Field about 2 miles north of the city of Taft, in Kern County, Calif., and lies in T 31 S., R 23 E , T. 32 S., R. 23 E , T 32 S , R 24 E , Mount Diablo Base and Meridian Its position relative to Taft and surrounding oil fields is shown in Fig. 1 Portions of 13 sections are included within the productive limits of the pool.

Elliot(Phillips Petroleum Company),,,,,,API-51-149,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1951,"Five oil reservoirs are presented in graphical studies of production interference. In each pool early wells had established a production decline trend over a period of years interference from later additional wells is reflected m abrupt downward changes in the trends of rate-time and rate-cumulative curves. In these five examples, from the standpoint pool were spaced closer than necessary.INTRODUCTIONSome of the confusion which has arisen in the discussion of the well-spacing problem can be resolved if three statements are clearly understood First A field will recover additional oil by additional wells when such wells penetrate undeveloped zones Second The lease with more wells captures oil from the lease with fewer wells Third It is sometimes profitable to drill additional wells merely to take advantage of increased current production rateThe first statement is with respect to a field having more than one producing zone or reservoir No disagreement exists on the necessity of drilling wells to develop every separate reservoir A field may have been completely drilled up on uniform spacing and may have produced for several years. It would be a normal course of development to drill additional wells for completion in a separate producing zone stratigraphically above or below the previously developed horizonThe second statement in recognizing capture behavior will help to avoid the mistake of accepting increased lease recoveries as an indication of increased pool recoveries The fact of regional migration has been accepted since the earliest days of the industry. An 1878 ruling of a Pennsylvania court became the rule of capture, viz , Petroleum gas and oil belong to the owner of the land, and are part of it, so long as they are on it or in it but when they escape and go into other land. the title of the former owner is gone if an adjoining owner drills his own land and taps a deposit of oil and gas, extending under his neighbor?s field, so that it comes into his own well, it becomes his property The first result of the acceptance of regional migration was the drilling of additional wells to protect leases from loss of oil to offset wells. More recently it has been realized that a1though regional migration directly caused close spacing, the same cause provided one of the strongest arguments for wider spacing If, on a lease basis, it is necessary to drill a well to keep oil from being produced by a well on another lease, then on a pool basis one of these wells is not neededThe third statement considers the present worth factor of the money to be received from sale of the oil when justifying the cost of drilling the additional wells it may be profitable to increase the well density even though no additional ultimate recovery is obtained This will be true when additional wells permit the lease a higher production rate, and when this higher production rate results in a sufficient increase in the present worth to return a profit on the increased investmentIn the completion of new wells in old pools relatively high initial producing rates attract attention. These are sometimes erroneously considered as reflecting ultimate recovery it is useful to remember that initial potential is controlled by well-bore conditions This vanes directly as the specific permeability, as the difference in pressure between the reservoir and the well bore, as the relative permeability of the formation to oil it is also important to consider the more effective later complete on methods as compared with those employed in earlier years, relatively high initial production rates may result from those improved completions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Krueger(Union Oil Company of California),,,,,,API-51-164,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1951,"Laboratory data indicate that fresh water and filtrates from fresh-water base muds significantly reduce the effective oil permeabilities of water sensitive cores, whereas various salt solutions and filtrates from saline muds cause little reduction and, in some cases, produce an increase. A simple test is described for evaluating the probable effect of mud filtrates on the effective oil permeabilities of water-sensitive cores. The mechanism of the interaction of mud filtrates with intergranular clays is discussed and several novel experimental observations are presented The effects of mud particles on inert aluminum cores have been studied by tests in a new type of mudding-off cell m which mud and bit action can be simulated under temperature and pressure conditions approximating those in the well bore A few additional static tests have been performed at high pressure and high temperature on natural cores from the Gatchell zone of the northeast Coalinga field Data from the dynamic mudding-off tests with oil- base, clay-water base, and emulsion muds indicate that mud particles penetrate through the inert cores and that filtrate losses for the particular cores used are an inverse Function of their permeabilities. A hypothesis, based on the observed mud-particle invasion, is presented which appears to explain the apparent dependence of filtrate losses on rock permeability. Mudded-off ,cores have shown initial losses up to 100 % percent in the effective oil permeability, but subsequent deplastering tests have indicated in general that little permanent impairment of the effective oil permeability of inert cores is caused by mud-particle invasion However, the deplastering data from tests performed under jetting-scraping conditions indicate that up to 35 percent permanent reduction m effective oil permeability may occur in the cores of high permeability. It is concluded that it is more desirable to complete wells with oil-base drilling fluid than with clay-water base or emulsion drilling fluids because of the extremely rapid recovery of oil permeability for cores mudded off with the former compared to the recoveries for cores mudded off with either of the latter in general, it appears that there is greater impairment of permeability produced from the interaction of fresh-water filtrates with water-sensitive cores than from the invasion of mud particles into inert coresINTRODUCTIONFrom the time the drill bit penetrates a productive zone to the time the well is placed on production, a series of operations described by the term completion practice take place which will affect the well productivity and the ultimate recovery from the reservoir.1,2Two distinct problems are involved during completion practiceI, penetration of the zone, and2, the subsequent mechanical operations It is with the first, viz , the effect of the cutting action of the bit combined with the hydraulic action of the mud on the permeability of the formation adjacent to the well bore, with which this report is concerned Variables of the nature of mud invasion, mud filtrate, mud particles, mud cake, and the jetting and scraping action of the drill bit are considered As a preliminary step toward the study of these variables a series of small-scale laboratory experiments under conditions approximating those in the well bore, with emphasis on the study of the effect of mud filtrates and mud particles on permeability, have been conducted and are herein reportedFor the purpose of discussion, the paper is divided into two parts The first part deals with the effect of aqueous solutions and field mud filtrates on the effective oil permeability of oil-bearing sand cores which are known to b",,American Petroleum Institute

The pressure pulsations of a power pump are a function of the rate of change of fluid flow, which, in turn, is proportional to pump speed therefore, it is indicated that a reduction of pressure pulsations can be accomplished by maintaining slower speeds. This is in direct contrast to the present-day practice of operating conventionally driven slush pumps which requires changing of fluid liners and increasing pump speeds with increased well depth. The application of mechanical multiple-speed transmissions and hydraulic torque converter drives has made possible slower speed operation while retaining the same size liner at a considerably greater depth A test was conducted to determine of a reduction in magnitude of pressure pulsations could be accomplished by the application of a torque converter drive The results of the test show that for a particular situation pressure pulsations of a conventionally driven pump were reduced by 50 percent A hypothetical case was then considered in which it was assumed that the converter drive was replaced by a mechanical multiple-speed transmission, and it was demonstrated that the pressure pulsations of the conventionally driven pump were reduced by 16 percent. In consequence of these demonstrations an analysis was developed to determine what increase in rated fluid end pressures of power pumps could reasonably be expected with a reduction of pressure pulsations For a particular situation it was demonstrated that the rated pressure of a power pump could be increased approximately 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively, by the substitution of a mechanical transmission or a torque converter drive for a conventional clutch power takeoffThe purpose of the study was to develop a practical analysis of the effect of hydraulic torque converter drives on power slush-pump characteristic, and to evaluate them on a basis of pressure pulsations by a comparison with conventional drives and mechanical multiple-speed transmissions Such transmissions would apply successively reduced speed ratios between pump and engine to permit the pump to operate without liner changes as the well depth increasesFor many years the direct-acting steam-driven slush pump was the most popular type for use in the oil fields However, as improvements were made In the construction of the power slush pump and a better understanding of its operation was developed, it became competitive economically as well as operationally to the steam pump Unfortunately, operators faded to recognize that the power pump was an almost entirely different piece of equipment which brought with it completely altered fluid-flow characteristic Until these differences have been recognized and fully understood, the operator cannot expect to replace the direct-acting steam pump with a power pump and obtain completely satisfactory performanceThe fluid ends of both types of pumps are alike , generally being of the reciprocating, double-acting type which includes a liquid cylinder, piston and rod, suction and discharge valves, and piping connections for the suction and discharge chambers However, In type of drive the pumps differ completely.",,American Petroleum Institute

Data were accumulated on a statistical form over a six-months period on 1,514 wells. The results of an analysis of these data are presentedData ProcurementThe first step in data procurement was the preparation of a form on which to accumulate information. Fig 1 is a reproduction of this form It is in considerable detail and, if properly executed, contains sufficient information to give ample data for a variety of studies and analyses This form has a large number of small holes in the margin. When these holes are properly punched according to a code set up by the analyst, it is possible to select the information desired by inserting a skewer-like instrument through the group of cards under scrutiny and removing those that answer the classification in which the analyst is interested. For example, all of the cards on wells on which centralizers were used can be removed from the group by one insertion of the skewerThe next problem was the procurement of the data. A list was prepared of the oil producers in the Southwestern distinct who would drill any considerable number of wells during 1950 A letter was prepared and sent to the management of these companies enclosing a sample form and asking for their assistance in procuring the data Most of the companies were quite cooperative, and assigned the procurement of the data to some person in their organization The cards were requested on all wells drilled during the last half of 1950 At this writing 1,514 cards have been received from 28 oil companies Many cards were received too late for inclusion in the study, and some contained insufficient data.

Test results prove that certain mixtures of lead, zinc, copper, and graphite dispersed in a suitable vehicle are satisfactory for this application. This thread compound forms a leak-resistant seal in the standardized 8-pitch round-thread tubing joint Field tests Indicate that the vibration to which mill-end joints are subjected during shipment from the null to the field has little effect upon the joint seal formed by this compositionINTRODUCTIONThe advent of deeper drilling has resulted in higher service pressures, increased formation temperatures, and heavier string loads As a result, the problem of joint leakage in casing and tubing is of major importance. Field results have proved conclusively that threaded joints on oil-country tubular goods will not be pressure tight unless the threads are properly coated with a suitable thread compound Most of the commercially available products consist of metallic zinc dispersed in a grease composition. These products have not been found suitable for deep high-pressure wells because they do not provide the necessary joint tightnessAt its 1947 meeting, the Special Research Sub- committee on Pipe (of the API Committee on Standardization of Oil Country Tubular Goods) recommended that the American Petroleum Institute sponsor an investigation for the purpose of developing a satisfactory thread compound Following are the requirements for such a compound as outlined in the report of that meetingMust have adequate lubricating qualities to prevent galling in the threaded connection during make-upMust not disintegrate nor undergo radical changes in volume at temperatures up to and including 300 F.Must not become too fluid at temperatures up to and including 300 FMust have sufficient sealing action to be leak proof at a temperature of 300 FMust be stable and contain no drier or hardener to evaporate or oxidize and thus change the characteristicsMust not readily absorb waterMust contain an inert filler adequate to prevent leakage in API round-thread casing and tubing joints.Should be readily applicable with a brush in cold weather.The recommendation was approved and a fellowship was established at Mellon Institute of Industrial Research effective May 1, 1949GENERAL SUMMARYA pipe-thread compound consists of three components, viz., a sealant capable of forming a pressure-tight joint, a thread lubricant to insure adequate joint make-up at a reasonable torque and to prevent galling or chafing of threads, and a vehicle or carrier to hold these components in suspension and aid in their application to the thread surfaces. In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between the components serving as the sealant and those providing the thread lubrication. Most fillers incorporated in commercial thread compounds affect both the sealing characteristics and the torque requirements for joint makeup Thus, these components appear to function in both capacities. However, thread lubrication and joint sealing are two distinct requirements and will, therefore, be considered separately",,American Petroleum Institute

The composition of the gas m solution in the oil was studied. The data obtained indicate that the oils in these two reservoirs had unusually varying physical characteristics. At Elk Basin, where all the oil in reservoir was under saturated with gas, the oil had a saturation pressure of 1,250 psi and 490 cu ft of gas in solution m a barrel of oil at the crest of the structure; and a saturation pressure of 530 psi and 134 cu ft of gas in solution in a barrel of oil low on the flanks. The hydrogen sulfide content of the gas in solution in the oil varied from 18 percent for oil on the crest to 5 percent for oil low on the flanks of the structure. At Rangely, where a gas cap existed and some of the oil m the reservoir was saturated with gas, the oil had a saturation pressure of 2,560 psia and 440 cu ft of gas m solution in a barrel of oil at or near the gas cap, and a saturation pressure of 1,960 psia and 230 cu ft of gas in solution in a barrel of oil at the oil-water contact on the flanks. The presence of appreciable amounts of nitrogen in the gas in solution in the oil revealed the possible effects of gases other than hydrocarbons on the characteristic of reservoir oils. Of even greater significance is the fact that the variable characteristics of these reservoir oils are related to the position of the oils in the structures. Many geologists and petroleum engineers have considered that all the oil in a petroleum reservoir has rather inform physical characteristic and that equilibrium conditions prevailed in all underground accumulations of oil and gas. That such is not always so is borne out by the results of these studies.INTRODUCTIONThe Rocky Mountain region is one in which may be found striking examples of the unusual in oil and gas accumulations, as is evident from the following The high helium content (76 percent) of the gas in the Ouray-Leadville limestone sequence In the Rattlesnake Field, New Mexico, and gases of similar helium content in other fields, 50 to 55 API gravity distillate in solution in carbon dioxide gas and recoverable through retrograde condensation In the North McCallum Field, Colorado, the occurrence of gas, oil, or both in closely related structures contrary to the usual concepts of gravimetric segregation, the accumulation of gas and/or oil in structures closely related to other structures which apparently are more favorable but which do not contain 011 or gas accumulations, the high hydrogen sulfide content (as high as 42 percent) of the gas associated with oil in some fields in the Big Horn Basin, Wyoming, and the wide range of fluid characteristics found in the Tensleep sandstone reservoir at Elk Basin and the Weber sandstone reservoir at Rangely.

This method is also tricky in that it is not always possible to even up the speed variation on the upstroke and downstroke. This results from the complex consideration of the geometry of the pumping unit and the shape of the load characteristic recorded by the dynamometer Fig 1, 2, and 3 Illustrate the foregoing points",,American Petroleum Institute

This was nearly half as much oil as could be obtained daily from all of the rest of the oil wells in the country. Thus, Captain Anthony Lucas's Spindletop well ushered in the day of gushers on the American oil scenePetroleum Industry-1951Today the domestic Industry is producing nearly 7,000,000 bbl of crude oil and natural-gas liquids, per day and is marketing natural gas with a heat value equivalent to another 2,800,000 bbl The domestic working stock of proved reserves amounts to 29 1/2 billion barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas equivalent to 31 billion barrels of oil in addition leases for prospecting, which are the oil source of the future, cover one in every nine acres in this countryhe development of the vast markets required to support the production gains of the past half century is a subject in Itself. However, future historians will surely note that demonstrated ability to meet every demand in full and on time was a major factor History will also record petroleum's continuing ability to compete with other fuels on a cost basis, the natural advantage of its products as clean, convenient fuels, and the impetus furnished by the development of the internal-combustion engine.",,American Petroleum Institute

This study of the operating pressures in actual use shows that, with exception of the Bradford Field of Pennsylvania and reservoirs in other parts of the country with oil sand shallower than 800 ft below the surface, the vast majority of water floods are operated at low pressure relative to depth. In the Bradford Field history will show that the trend is toward the use of higher and higher pressures. Reasons for the use of high pressure are presented with actual cases to illustrate the advantages of high pressure. The economics of operating at different pressures is discussed A suggested procedure for water-flood operators to follow in choosing the proper pressure for water flooding new fields includes the use of core data, field tests, and economic considerations including the cost of pumping.The oil produced by a water flood is moved through the reservoir to producing wells by the pressure gradient set up between water-injection wells and oil-producing wells Whether or not there is an optimum pressure gradient for water flooding has been debated by workers of several branches of the producing Industry for many years. Those who advocate an optimum pressure gradient are divided into and low-pressure schools Field data, laboratory results, and theoretical considerations on this subject are found in the literature1through lo with no distinct agreement and no positive rules that are accepted by the Industry This paper does not attempt to answer the question fully Presented here is an analysis of the pressure actually used in various water floods in different water-flood oil fields throughout the country. Field data showing additional oil recovery resulting from a pressure increase is included In addition, an approach is made toward solving the problem of determining the optimum pressure for new oil fieldsFlooding Pressures Used in Various Sandstone Oil Fields of the United StatesA basis is required which will fairly and adequately compare the operating water pressures used In various fields It is not advisable to examine pressure data on the basis of wellhead or pressure-plant pressures alone The sand-face pressure, which is the hydrostatic head pressure added to wellhead pressure, is the pressure energy available to drive oil from the sand face at an injection well Any comparison of water-flooding pressures must consider sand-face pressure unless depths to the sand are identical in the cases studiedWhat is meant by the terms high pressure and low pressure must be decided before these terms are used. The maximum water pressure which it is possible to place on the sand face of an oil reservoir has been discussed by several authors11,12,13In all cases it is agreed that there is a general relation between the average depth of the sand below the surface and the maximum pressure attainable without rupturing the formation. Unfortunately, this relationship is not precise and wide variations are found, even on the same property Above the critical maximum or break-through pressure, a large part of the water injected into the input wells travels directly through parted cracks or ruptured zones in the formation to producing wells without moving through the porous sandstone. A high-pressure water flood is considered one which is operated at, or near this critical pressure",,American Petroleum Institute

As background information, however, the following comments are pertinent to the present discussion.The precise mechanism of fluid flowing through an oil sand is imperfectly known. The currently accepted theory for reservoir engineering denies the possibility of materially affecting the ultimate recovery of oil by changing pressure gradients. On the basis of this theory, Dickey and Buckwalter1. in 1946 discussed the advantages of increased injection rates at water input wells.In that paper, they gave both mathematical computations and a few examples, to Illustrate a definite economic benefit to be derived from increased injection rates. It was pointed out that an increase In pressure late in the life of the flood would almost automatically result in an increase in ultimate recovery because of the fact that operating costs are relatively constant for moderate changes In fluid throughputAttempts have been made to investigate the effects of variations in pressure gradient on the flooding processes in the laboratory. The resulting data have been somewhat conflicting and there are still proponents on both sides of the question of high pressure vs. low pressureJ N. Breston and Richard V. Hughes2renewed some of the more pertinent laboratory data and presented then own data showing a definite benefit in ultimate oil recovery by the use of higher pressures In long-core experiment. As pointed out In that paper, all laboratory experiments are subject to challenge on the basis that they do not entirely duplicate field conditions. It 1s an interesting fact, however, that the closer laboratory experiments approach conditions believed to exist in the field, the more they indicate that increased pressures yield more oil.

Reservoir conditions that affect the injection of water are discussed. Geologic processes, which control the formation of porous rocks and then subsequent compaction and deformation, have an important effect on the injection of water into oil- bearing rocks The porosity of the rock enables it to hold the reservoir fluids The permeability of the rock enables it to convey fluids when a differential in pressure is created. Water-injection techniques have been employed most successfully in fields where the natural production mechanism is by dissolved-gas drive The effect of variable well spacing is a factor of tune rather than of recovery The contention that wide well spacing has resulted in great losses of oil is disproved by a multitude of data The injection of water into oil-bearing rocks may be controlled by the manner m which input and producing wells are completed and equipped, by the pressure differential that is created in the reservoir, and by the manner in which reservoir fluids are withdrawn. The characteristics of the reservoir and of the fluids. It contains are less easily controlled The amount of oil that can be obtained by the injection of water is dependent upon the fluid content of the reservoir The physical characteristics of the reservoir fluids are important in determining the effectiveness of the recovery process. The importance of capillary and surface forces has been recognized for many years, but it is only recently that it has been possible to evaluate then effects semiquantitatively. Water-injection pressures must be held at levels where pressure-parting of the reservoir will not take place. The highest injection rates that can be employed safely have given superior results m the Bradford and Allegany Fields. Several Important water-injection operations in various parts of the United States are described The fields that are considered were selected because of their historical significance or because they will serve to show the development or application of some particular technique. Some recent developments in water-injection techniques and then possible effect on the improvement of oil recovery are described. Heating of the reservoir at the bottom of water-input wells, the combination of gas injection with water injection, several uses of surface-active compounds, and the use of carbonated water are promising methods for increasing the efficiency of oil recovery. The manner in which they have been applied and the results which have been obtained are discussed The contributions that the science of physics has made to the recovery of oil are recognized However, physical methods have understandable limitations. A combination of physics with chemistry, in the application of principles of physical chemistry to a reduction In the residual-oil content remaining in reservoirs, seems to offer, at the present time, the most promising possibilities for obtaining the maximum economic recovery of oilINTRODUCTIONThe continued increase in demand for oil in the United States, which is being accelerated currently by defense requirements, has served to focus attention on the application of methods that will result in the extraction of the maximum economic recovery from existing fields.",,American Petroleum Institute

When such division before production occurs, the owners may work together cooperatively to reduce the greatest amount of their common resource to possession For this reason unit management is ultimately the means for accomplishing the conservation of our petroleum resources This discussion covers the historical development of the principle of unlit management of oil and gas pools, and points out the already extensive use of that particular system throughout the oil-producing areas of the United States Experience in applying the system of unit management is now so extensive as to remove that method of operation from the realm of speculation and theory to a point of established fact that unit management leads to substantially greater recovery of oil and gas Unit management is no more than the extension of the principle of partnership operation of separate leases to embrace entire pools. It is consistent with fundamental principles of law, and is well founded on scientific and technical principles The principal barrier to further progress in applying unit management on a larger scale is the lack of public education and industry understanding of what is to be accomplished A further important barrier is the absence in all states except Oklahoma. Arkansas, and Louisiana of the necessary enabling legislation which would make unit management practical of attainment in all pools which are particularly suited to that type of operation.INTRODUCTIONOne must observe at the outset that the current and near-future progress of unit operation depends upon further education of the industry and of the public in the merit of that system of management of oil and gas pools All that could be said for or against unit operation has been said many times in published articles or in conclaves of the industry since that time in December 1924 when Henry L Doherty first brought the subject forcibly to public attention The field has been plowed many times Few subjects in petroleum production practices have received greater attention. - Those who are interested in the history of unit operation will find in the book by Robert E Hardwicke,1an informative discourse of all of the important incidents and events associated with the development of the idea .

Internal corrosion in both oil and gas wells is believed to be due to the acidity developed m the water phase. The acids found and an evaluation of their corrosive behavior are discussed. The variable factors influencing corrosion rates are also discussed. In light of the action of the various corrodents and variables, the utility and limitations of the various prediction schemes are presented and a recommended plan of corrosion evaluation is set forth.INTRODUCTIONCorrosion in oil and gas wells, other than in sour crude areas, had received little or no attention before 1945 and 1946. The severe corrosive attack noted in high-pressure condensate wells about that time initiated considerable study of internal corrosion problems The greater portion of this work applied specifically to gas-condensate corrosion However, in the past few years it has become Increasingly evident that there are definite correlations which can be made to oil-field practice. Many of the techniques and generalization on corrosive mechanisms made in condensate corrosion studies can be applied to oil-field corrosion studies it is the objective of this paper to generalize the facts known about gas-condensate corrosion and integrate them with the work thus far done in oil-well corrosion in order to present a discussion of corrosion which is applicable to both oil and gas wells Thus the corrosive agents, their actions, and methods which have been used to predict corrosive behavior will be discussedThe Corrosive Medium-WaterIn either oil or gas wells, the first prerequisite for corrosive action is the presence of liquid water Corrosion takes place in the water phase and, consequently, a full knowledge of the nature of this phase is necessary if we are to understand or predict the course of corrosion One of the major differences between oil and gas-well corrosion is the behavior of the water phase. In condensate wells, the liquid water Increases from formation to surface and there is good evidence that the liquid water is swept up the surface of the pipe in intimate contact with the steel The corrosive water produced in a condensate well nearly comes to equilibrium, reacting with the steel by the time it reaches the surface. In the case of an oil well, the water production is the same from the formation to the surface and the possibility of selective water flow along the pipe is improbable. The contact time with the water is reduced and surface effects, such as preferentially oil-wet areas and emulsion formation, make oil wells less corrosive than condensate wells of the same corrosive potential.",,American Petroleum Institute

The advantages of and objection to the use of oil-emulsion muds in the drilling operation; and their effect on the geological interpretation and upon the completion operation are discussed.INTRODUCTIONAt the 1950 meeting of the Southwestern District, Division of Production, the District committee on Drilling Practice appointed a study committee to investigate developments and problems related to the use of drilling fluids. Several subcommittees were assigned specific subjects to investigate. One of the groups was assigned the study of oil- emulsion drilling fluid with particular emphasis on the effect of the emulsion on the drilling operation, the geological interpretation of logs and samples, and upon well completions in view of the current interest and the apparent importance of this subject, the committee was requested to present a report on oil-emulsion mud at the 1951 district meeting This paper summarizes the information which has been developed. Several previous papers on the subject have been presented at other meetings giving case histories and field results. This report does not attempt to present additional case histories instead, its purpose isTo emphasize certain points of distinction between drilling fluids containing oil.To summarize the advantages of and objections to the use of emulsion mudsTo stimulate the funneling of additional data and information to the study committeeThe earliest use of oil in rotary drilling is not known, but for many years it has been used occasionally to accomplish a variety of results, such as loosen stuck drill pipe, slick up the hole prior to running casing, and drilling-in for completion. During the past few years oil has been added to practically all types of water-base drilling fluids to form an oil-in-water emulsion This fluids has been used in both drilling and completion operations. Reports of field results indicate that the presence of emulsified oil in mud does improve its performanceThe terms emulsion mud or oil-emulsion drilling fluid are used to refer to any water-base drilling fluid containing oil and an emulsifying~ agent. Numerous combination of different drilling fluids, emulsifying agents, and oils are possible. To permit a better interpretation of the results obtained with emulsion muds, it is believed that a distinction should be made between the emulsifying agents used for stabilization, the drilling fluids to which the oil is added, and the oil is used in the emulsion",,American Petroleum Institute

The investigation was undertaken to study the recovery efficiency resulting from a natural water drive m a California reservoir. The Vedder Pool of the Wasco Field is the first deep reservoir in California to approach economic depletion The pool, which was discovered in 1938, comprises 500 acres. It has been subject to an active water drive to an extent that the current pressure is only 10 percent less than the initial As the oil was considerably undersaturated, the saturation pressure was not reached. The ultimate recovery factor us indicated to be 50 percent of the tank oil initially in place, which is compatible with the recoveries obtained from water-drive pools in other sections of the United States. From a theoretical displacement efficiency standpoint, there is no essential difference between a natural and an artificial water-drive mechanism. Accordingly, the fact that a California reservoir has shown a successful response to a natural water drive lends encouragement to artificial flooding prospectsINTRODUCTIONThe Wasco Field is located in the San Joaquin Valley in Kern County, California, 5 miles west of Wasco in T. 27 S., R. 24 E. The field was discovered in 1938 as a result of seismic work. The discovery well, Continental oil Company's KCLA-2, was drilled to the then world-record depth of 15,004 ft, and, when plugged back and perforated from 13,092 to 13,175 ft, established a new world-record production depth The initial production rate was 3,663 bbl per day of 35 7 API oil with a gas-oil ratio of 470 cu ft per bblGEOLOGIC DATAThe Wasco structure is an elongated dome, the longitudinal axis of which trends northwest and southeast. A map of the field showing contours on the top of the Vedder sand is shown on Fig. 1. The field had an initial productive area of 500 acres, and a closure of 85 ft. There is no evidence of faulting in the reservoir.The productive measures of the Vedder Pool are of Lower Miocene age and are encountered at an average depth of 13,000 ft at Wasco. They are generally considered to be the equivalent of the Vedder zone found at Mount Poso, Rio Bravo, and other fields in this area. In September 1949 the Standard oil Company deepened then well Mush-rush No. 5 to 15,866 ft for a test of the Eocene sand. Although production was obtained at this depth, performance has not been sufficiently attractive to encourage an aggressive drilling program.RESERVOIR CHARACTERISTICSSand CharacteristicsThe Vedder formation at Wasco is a hard and well consolidated sandstone. Core-analysis data are relatively meager. A total of 62 samples from 4 wells were analyzed for porosity and permeability, for 11 of which interstitial water determinations were also made by the capillary ( air displacement) method (see Fig 2) On the basis of these data, the average porosity and permeability are 15.4 per cent and 278 millidarcys, respectively. The above permeability was computed on the basis of an arithmetic average of the available data. An average permeability of 1,500 millidarcys is obtained if the average specific productivity index, as determined by depth-pressure measurements, is converted to an equivalent laboratory permeability on the basis of the Johnston-Sherborne empirical correlation for California fields1. This discrepancy is not surprising in view of the small number of samples",,American Petroleum Institute

This is still a desirable feature for geological correlation and stratigraphic studies From a quantitative interpretation standpoint logs are actually a simultaneous system of equations , one equation corresponding to each curve A standard log is composed most generally of at least three curves which permit the calculation of three unknowns, vizThe S P. curve indirectly permits an evaluation of the formation water salinity in parts per million. More directly, it is the resistivity of this water which is evaluated.The short investigation resistivity curve (that with short spacing) responds mainly to the characteristics of the mud-filtrate invaded zone in a porous formation and permits an evaluation of formation porosity in percent.The long investigation resistivity curve (that with long spacing) responds mostly to the undisturbed and non-invaded part of porous formations and permits the evaluation of the true resistivity of the formation in place Further calculations permit the evaluation of connate-water saturation and forecasting of the oil (and/or gas, as the case may be) productivity of a specific formation of interest.The details of the foregoing evaluations are naturally complicated by various distortions introduced in the log's various curves by bore-hole diameter, bed thickness, electrode configuration, etc. These complications are not discussed in detail. An example of log interpretation illustrates the paper.INTRODUCTIONQuantitative electrical-log interpretation entails, as its ultimate objective, the determination of reservoir porosity (and effective pay), formation-water saturation, permeability, and expected fluid production ratio (ability to produce oil and/or gas and at what water-oil or water-gas ratio). The Interpretation of electrical logs is an intricate subject which presupposes considerable technical of the principles involved in the measurement, so that logs which may appear as problems may be solved by the application of fundamental thought. It may be said well known that one cannot solve for more unknown quantities than there are simultaneous equation in an algebraic problem. The unknowns in the electrical-log interpretation are (formula available in full paper)Generally, the electrical log offers three fundamental curves (S.P., short normal, lateral) for the solution of the independent unknowns it is quite evident at either reasonable assumptions must be made concerning some of the unknowns or they must be measured independently. The quantities whose values are generally assumed are connate-water resistivity( or its equivalent, the S.P lithological factor), the cementation and saturation exponents. All three assumed quantities are lithological factors Which depend upon the mineral makeup. Fortunately, they remain fairly constant and are characteristic of geological formations susceptible to be reservoir rocks.

The conclusions and recommendations were reached from this threefold study.INTRODUCTIONThe term paraffin is given to the waxy residues from crude oils that are deposited in the tubing, casing, and on the walls of the producing oil- and gas-well bores. These paraffin accumulations have been a problem to oil operators since the early days of the oil IndustryThere has been much research done on this problem, both preventative and alleviative measures, some quite successful and others fading entirely in the purpose.Each oil field has its own peculiar characteristics and conditions, and similarly, individual wells, even those adjoining each other, often have very different operating conditions Hence, a paraffin treatment that might work on one well or local area, may be entirely unsuccessful in another well or fieldPhysical Nature of ParaffinBriefly, the crystalline behavior and chemical composition of paraffin are discussed herein Some say that there are both crystalline and amorphous (non-crystalline el waxes found in paraffin, where as others believe that the waxes found in paraffin are all crystalline, the crystalline development of some waxes having merely been retarded and altered by the crystallizing medium of oil and possibly by the presence of colloidal material.The number of different compounds and types of waxes found in paraffin are dependent upon the character of the crude oil. These include crude oil, water, gums and resins, asphaltenes, sand, and siltIt has been found that oil is mostly mechanically held in paraffin, i e., trapped between the wax grams There is some oil actually in solution or absorbed by wax crystals, but the amount is small The same is true for any type of water present in the paraffin.A large amount of oil in paraffin tends to make it soft, semi-fluid, and more readily affected by heat, regardless of the melting point of the wax present. This true because the oil dissolves and softens part of the wax when the temperature is increased if very little oil is present in the paraffin, the paraffin is hard and less plastic, and an increase in temperature does not have much effect on plasticity until it approaches the melting point of the solid waxes presentThe gums and resins are normally reddish-brown unsaturated compounds in solution in the crude oil. Their presence in paraffin waxes is probably due partly to their absorption by the wax as it crystallizes from the solution, and also is the result of decreased crude-oil solubility due to temperature change and loss of lighter fractions. The gums and resins normally comprise about 10 to 15 percent of paraffin1",,American Petroleum Institute

Trishman(Spang-Chalfant Divison of The National Supply Company Ambridge),,,,,,API-52-007,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"Three methods for the improvement of the fatigue resistance of drill-collar joints have been investigated by full-size fatigue tests. The previously known method of nitriding steel surfaces to prevent fatigue failure was applied to full-size fatigue test bars. The fatigue endurance limit was found to be more than twice that of untreated test bars; however, the notch-embrittling effect of the hard nitride layer at the root of the thread of threaded tests was sufficient to cause transverse failure during buck-up of joints so treated. Cold rolling of threads was studied in a fundamental way and equipment developed for accurately rolling threads to a given depth in both the box and pin members. The optimum amount of cold rolling necessary to obtain the optimum in fatigue endurance was determined. The greatest amount of improvement in the fatigue endurance level of a threaded joint was obtained by cutting a stress-relief groove at the zone of the last-engaged thread. Full-size fatigue tests were made on bucked-up joints with a stress-relief groove cut in either the pin or the box or in both members. All fatigue tests were made in air, i.e., under non-corrosive conditions.INTRODUCTIONThe selection, application, and proper field handling of drill collars undoubtedly contributes most to their satisfactory performance and the maximum service obtainable. The importance of good drill collars in a drill string cannot be too highly stressed. Even though a drill collar appears to be a fairly simple piece of drilling equipment, it is necessary to expend a considerable amount of metallurgical engineering and mechanical design knowledge in order to produce a longer lasting collar.Mac Donald and Lubinskilhave studied the effect of drill-collar size on the straightness of hole obtainable and have made definite recommendations for drilling practice in crooked-hole country. Caution has been given concerning the placing of more weight on the bit than that which approaches the critical amount necessary to cause buckling of the drill collars.Moore2mentions that the greater portion of drill-collar failures in the field are the result of fatigue at the connections, either simple fatigue in the pins or corrosion fatigue at the boxes. Excessive transverse loading on. the joints produced by excessive weight on the bit, with the attendant drill: collar buckling, or drilling in a crooked hole will produce early failure by fatigue. Metallurgical factors which affect drill-collar performance have been discussed by Stoup.3 The advantage of fully heat-treated collars, heat stress relieved after straightening, have been brought out. A unique chart as an aid to the selection of the optimum taper-joint connection to be used on a collar of a given bore and outside diameter has been presented. By the use of this chart, grossly unbalanced proportions in the pin and box can be avoided.From time to time various ideas have been proposed to improve drill-collar threaded joints. From some of these ideas, improved joints now in service in the field have evolved. Although field use is the ultimate in testing, the results are slow in coming forth;",,American Petroleum Institute

Louis F. Davis (The Atlantic Refining Co., Dallas), served as chairman of this study committee from its initial organization until the committee was terminated in March 1952. The purposes of the study were to determine:, industry practices;, the factors contributing to cementing failures; and,, if possible, the effectiveness of the different methods used. Data were accumulated on a statistical form over a month period on 1,514 wells. The results of an analysis of these data were presented at the spring meeting in 1951 and published inDrilling and Production Practice (1951). To conclude the work of the study committee, it was decided to continue the survey on primary cementing with special emphasis on the use of gels and other cement additives. It was believed this second survey would supplement the original data; and it was desired to determine, if possible, the effect of gel and additives upon the quality of the cement job; and to determine industry practices on the usage of these materials. Data were accumulated in a statistical form on 567 wells which were cemented during the last half of 1951 and the esults of the analysis of these data are presentedData ProcurementBased upon experience obtained in the initial survey, a revised data form was prepared which included spaces for data on gels and other additives. Fig. 1 is a reproduction of the data card. This form has many numbered holes in the margin so that, when punched according to a code system set up for analysis purposes, it is possible to select the desired information by the use of a skewer-like instrument. For example, all of the cards on wells having a bad cementing job may be sorted into a single group by one insertion of the skewer.The contributing members of the study committee were responsible for returning data forms from their respective companies. A total of 567 cards were received, of which 502 were received in time and were sufficiently well filled out to be included in the analysis. Cards were received from 18 companies contributing to the survey. Fig. 2 shows the geographical distribution of the wells on which data were obtained on cementing of the production casing string.

Problems will be encountered which may seem confusing to a person used to operating only in the United States. However, it would be difficult to find a place where government officials are more helpful and cooperative. Appropriate laws provide for orderly development of oil and gas resources, the prevention of waste and monopoly while encouraging individual enterprise and obtaining for the people of the provinces a fair share of the returns resulting from production. Covered very briefly are such steps as acquisition of mineral rights, payment of fees and rentals,. exploration work and progress reports which must be submitted to the government for approval, conversion of reservations into leases in order to reduce holdings to include only desirable acreage, and various custom and tariff regulations a s well as immigration and tax laws peculiar to Canada. Also included is a discussion of the various types of operating organizations which may be used by an individual or corporation.INTRODUCTIONIn these hectic times it is refreshing to note that there still exists a place where free enterprise and individual effort not only prevail but are openly encouraged, and the rewards obtainable are in direct proportion to the energy expended.Such a place is Canada, which comprises one-half of the continent of North America.The average American usually thinks of Canada as being a wonderful place for a vacation and for fishing, hunting, and summer and winter sports. Not many Americans realize that Canada is larger in area than the United States. There are 3,695,189 square miles in Canada compared with 3,022,387 square miles in the United States. There is plenty of room for a lot more people in Canada because the population is only 13,854,000.Canada is a great grain-producing country and some of the best beef in the world comes from the vast ranches in the western provinces. In natural resources Canada has been very richly endowed with timber, coal, iron, copper, nickel, lead, zinc, gold, silver, uranium, and, in recent years, vast reserves of oil and gas.Government-FederalCanada is no longer a Dominion under Britain, but is an independent and sovereign member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is now on its own, and doing very well. Like the United States, it is a federation with provincial governments similar on the whole to the state governments of the United States and with the city of Ottawa, Ontario, corresponding to Washington, D. C. as the chief legislative, executive, and judicial seat of the country.The Federal government consists of:The governor general, who is appointed by the Crown.The prime minister, who is elected by the People.The senate, the members of which are nominated for life.The house of commons, the members of which are elected by the people for 5-year terms.

Blackwood(Amerada Petroleum Corporation),,,,,,API-52-044,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"The fields discovered in the Spraberry trend of Dawson, Martin, Midland, Glasscock, Upton, Reagan, and Sterling Counties of West Texas indicate the possibility of one continuous reservoir covering over one million acres. The present field rules call for the development of one well to each 40 acres. Because of the poor quality of a part of the reservoir and of the shortages of steel and other materials, it will take several years to fully develop the area. With such a large number of ultimate wells, the producing problems will be varied and extensive. The Spraberry is a fractured-type formation but usually requires artificial stimulation to produce flowing wells. Presently the majority of the wells are produced by natural flow. The matrix has a lo permeability, thus the bottom-hole pressures decline rapidly after the flush production from the fractured system. Coincident with declining pressures the gas- oil ratios are increasing and will continue to increase rapidly. Wells will go on artificial lift in their early life. Conventional pumping will be the most widely used method. With fluid lift, gas lift, and hydraulic long-stroke lift in the minority. It is conceivable that many wells will be produced to their economic limit by natural flow because of high gas-oil ratios. Flowing-pressure tests have shown that the wells have declining productivity indices, indicating that the rate of oil production will decline rapidly and the percentage recovery of the oil in place will be disappointing. Increasing the ultimate recovery by secondary methods is not promising at this timeINTRODUCTIONThe Spraberry sand got its name in the Spraberry Deep Field in eastern Dawson County where oil production from that zone was opened in January 1949. The second Spraberry discovery was the Tex Harvey Field in eastern Midland County. This discovery was completed in February 1949, but by the end of 1949 there were only three wells in the field. However, this discovery was the beginning of the most active part of the Spraberry trend. Development gradually increased in the Tex Harvey Field during 1950; and the Germania, Midkiff, Pembrook, Benedum Spraberry, Huddle-Manning, and Smith Spraberry Fields were discovered.During the early part of 1951 there were several Spraberry discoveries and development became widespread in Midland, Glasscock, Upton, and Regan Counties. By mid-1951 there were approximately 180 rigs drilling development or wildcat wells to the Spraberry. At the end of 1951 there were approximately 230 drilling wells and 987 Spraberry producing wells. Production from all Spraberry fields during December 1951 was 2,021, 685 bbl and the cumulative production to the end of 1951 was 12,103,489 bbl.Fig. 1 shows the area of West Texas where the Spraberry trend is being explored and developed.

468,321014,,Sweet-oil Well Corrosion,H.L. Bilhartz(The Atlantic Refining Company),,,,,,API-52-054,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"Sweet-oil well corrosion has only recently been recognized as presenting a major economic problem. Corrosion attach on tubing in high-pressure sweet-oil wells was first observed in 1945, but its seriousness was not fully apparent until 1948. Even more recently, sweet-oil well corrosion in low-pressure wells has become a problem of major concern. These two problems, viz., high-pressure and low-pressure sweet-oil well corrosion, are discussed briefly from the standpoint of investigative approach, development of criteria of such corrosion, causative agents, and remedial measures.INTRODUCTIONThe problem of sweet-oil well corrosion has been recognized as one of economic importance within recent years. In 1945 attack on tubing in high-pressure sweet-oil wells in southeastern Louisiana was observed for the first time. Its seriousness was not fully comprehended until 1948, when a high-pressure well blew out as a direct result of corrosion. The monetary loss of this single failure was $150,000 plus loss of the well. Subsequently one-half million dollars were spent on corrosion in this field by one company in one year. Careful investigation by other companies revealed that serious corrosion was occurring in most wells in the general geographic area. This particular problem constitutes one of the two major concerns of the corrosion engineer interested in sweet-oil well corrosion. The other deals with lower pressure wells and was recognized even more recently. It is predicted that corrosion costs chargeable to this single problem will be approximately three million dollars this year (1952). For the sake of expediency, the two projects have been termed by industry as:1, high-pressure sweetoil well corrosion; and2, low-pressure sweet-oil well corrosion. This vague terminology will suffice for current consideration. It is quite probable, however, that with the advent of a clearer understanding of the mechanism of attack, the two problems will be closely related. The principal differences at this time are twofold, viz.:Severe corrosion has been noted under high-pressure conditions where little or no water is produced. By contrast, a critical wateroil ratio must be exceeded before perceptible attack occurs in the low-pressure category.Corrosion becomes active immediately after production is commenced in the high-pressure environment; whereas, many years (10 to 15) of corrosion-free operation have been observed in the low-pressure category before serious metal loss occurs.Method of ApproachThe initial approach of study was very similar in both instances. It became apparent shortly after recognition of the problems that cooperative effort between producing companies could expedite an economical solution. The technical practices committee framework of the National Association of Corrosion Engineers provided an excellent forum whereby some 30 , participating companies could pool their technical effort. A subcommittee of the Oil and Gas Production Committee was formed to consider all aspects of sweet-oil well corrosion. Through the combined efforts of technical men from the participating companies, progress was far more rapid than could have been possible with engineers working individually.",,American Petroleum Institute

Instrumented shots in shallow drill holes were used in the field tests to study the effects on the strain produced in sandstone of:1, the length of cylindrical explosive charges;2, the kind and amount of stemming; and3, the type of explosive used in the charge. Difficulties with the test site prevented completion of the tests, but the data obtained demonstrate the important effect of these factors on the strain-producing ability of a given explosive. In addition to field testing, the strength and elastic properties of 10 reservoir rocks were determined in the laboratory. The tabulation of these values indicates an interrelation of the physical properties of sandstones. Development of the correlation in detail would provide a means of determining any of the strength and elastic constants on the basis of only one or two rather simple tests that could be made in any laboratoryINTRODUCTIONThe research program of the Bureau of Mines on well shooting has been described in previous report,1,2which also indicated the results of preliminary experimental work. This progress report covers field and laboratory t e s t s made during 1950 and outlines plans for future investigations. Although the results are not considered conclusive, they are presented to stimulate discussion and to invite comments on the future course of the research program.The objective of the research program is to establish criteria that will be generally applicable to the petroleum engineer's problem of designing the most efficient shot for a given well. The development of these criteria requires an experimental program to evaluate separately the effects of the properties of the explosive and of the methods of loading, stemming, and firing the explosive on the increase in fluid conductivity of a shot well. Obviously, it is necessary to make a large number of controlled experimental shots in drill holes in representative rocks to accomplish these evaluations. Direct measurements of fluid conductivity can be made by injection testing, but this procedure is costly and time-consuming. The measurement of certain characteristics of the seismic wave generated by an explosion is easier and cheaper, because much shallower holes may be used. In the current experimental program, measurements of the strain set up in the rock by the seismic wave from shots in shallow holes are being used in studying the effect of the factors of shot design. Strain measurements can then be correlated with the fluid conductivity of shot holes by injection tests on deeper holes. Field experiments to date have been concerned with developing methods of strain measurement and with determining the general propagation characteristics of strain waves generated by well shots. Inasmuch as the relation of the factors of shot design to the fluid conductivity of wells must be defined in terms of the strength, hardness, and elasticity of the rock, these properties of reservoir rocks must be determined. A laboratory testing program is under way for measuring the physical properties of reservoir rocks, and the results of tests on 10 representative rocks are presented herein.",,American Petroleum Institute

Neznayko(Baroid Sales Division National Lead Company)|P.W. Gilkeson(Baroid Sales Division National Lead Company),,,,,,API-52-073,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"Lime-treated muds sometimes solidify in deep, hot holes in the time required to make a round trip with the bit. Some of the factors affecting this hardening have been studied by heating mud in sealed containers. Stiffening occurs more rapidly as the temperature is raised. The rate of hardening is dependent also upon the amount and nature of the solids present and the chemical treatment Chemical and X-ray analyses support the theory that solidification is brought about by the interaction of caustic soda and lime with the clay minerals present in the mud. Solidification is retarded by tannins, lignites, and other organic mudthinners; and by a number of other substances which retard the setting of cement.Within the last eight years, lime-treated mud has come to be regarded as the best available for deep drilling in the Gulf Coast area. At present, relatively few wells are drilled below 10,000 ft with any other type of drilling fluid. Ease of control, economy of maintenance, and resistance to contamination characterize lime-treated muds.1,2,3,4,5Along with these desirable features, some undesirable properties have appeared, especially in deep, hot holes where heavy mud is necessary. ccasionally the logging electrode fails to reach bottom and, when the bit is run back into the hole, no bridge is found but thick mud is pumped out. In other instances, excessive pressure is required to break circulation after a trip, drill pipe is stuck, perforating guns do not go to the depth desired, or packers cannot be pulled after a production test. While these difficulties are not prevalent, and by no means are restricted to wells drilled with lime mud, they have been traced definitely, in a number of cases, to thickening of the lime-treated mud on standing in the hole.The solidification of lime-treated mud was attributed at first to loss of water from the mud under the conditions of temperature and pressure prevailing in the hole; but loss of water by filtration obviously could not occur in a cased hole. Also, fragments of stiff mud recovered on the shaker screen had practically the same water content as the original mud. More than three years ago, thickening was observed in samples heated at the surface and, since that time, storage cells have been devised which make possible the duplication in the laboratory of the changes in the mud which occur in hot holes6It became evident early in the study that the thickening process was not due simply to gelation of the type commonly found in a bentonite-water mud. Stirring did not restore the thickened mud to anything like the original condition. A stiff mud, after being mixed with enough water to form a slurry, might again become stiff on heating, behaving in much the same way as partly set cement.These observations prompted a study of the mechanism of the hardening of lime-treated muds at high temperature. Progress on that phase of the problem has been slow because the emphasis has been placed on the alleviation of immediate difficulties on drilling wells. Hundreds, of tests have been made in the laboratory and in the field and the complete solution to the problem is still to be found. Although the study is incomplete, it is believed that a discussion at this time of some of the factors concerned in the thickening of lime-treated mud may be helpful to others working on the problem.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hellums(Cron and Gracey Corporation),,,,,,API-52-083,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"This paper presents data concerning the efficient use of the horsepower available for mud circulation. It is indicated that in the drilling of soft and medium formations the rate of penetration of the bit is approximately proportional to the hydraulic horsepower applied, the maximum being obtained when all the horsepower available above that required for an adequate annular return velocity is utilized to increase the energy of the bit-fluid jet stream. There is possibly an upper limit in the amount of the jet-stream energy needed to obtain maximum drilling rates in medium-hard to hard formations.INTRODUCTIONIn past years, and on a large number of rigs today, the output horsepower of the mud pump has been utilized in most instances to circulate the maximum volume possible, as experience had indicated that this was probably the best application. However, in 1948 information was published.1,2that indicated the drilling rate was not only proportional to the circulating rate, but was also proportional to the bit nozzle fluid velocity. It was also stated that it was probably best to increase the nozzle fluid velocity to obtain an increase in drilling rate, as this would require less horsepower than would increasing the volume circulated. Bits were developed for the application of this principle, and a relatively large number of wells have been drilled in different areas during the past 3 1/2 years where the horsepower available for mud circulation was efficiently applied.It is the purpose of this paper to evaluate the results obtained by the efficient application of available pump horsepower.The conclusions and recommendations presented are based on data obtained from representative wells drilled in Southwest Texas, Texas upper and lower Gulf Coast, East Texas, Louisiana Gulf Coast, Mississippi, North Louisiana, and South Arkansas. The formations that were drilled ranged from soft sand and shales to medium-hard sandstones, shales, and limestones.DISCUSSIONThe hydraulic horsepower requirement of a mud pump depends upon the volume being circulated and the pressure required to circulate such volume. The pressure required i s the result of four principal elements in the rig circulating system, viz.:Friction losses through the inside of the drill pipe and drill collars.Friction losses in the annulus between the well bore.and the outside of the drill string.Friction losses through the surface connections, including the mud lines, standpipe, hose, swivel, kelly, etc.Pressure drop across the bit nozzles. The friction losses through the inside of the drill string increase rapidly as the volume circulated i s increased, which makes this factor of prime importance in determining how the available pump horsepower will be utilized. The following example will illustrate the effect of increased volume on the friction losses in the drill pipe and also on the hydraulic horsepower required:",,American Petroleum Institute

Sullivan(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-52-094,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"Use of automatic control equipment to control tank topping-out and switching, to shut in the lease when tanks are full or in the event of equipment failure, and to regulate the producing period of individual wells is profitable in the East Texas Field when lease conditions are such as to permit effective utilization of the increased pumper productivity resulting from the use of the automatic equipment. Similar benefits can be realized from the use of such equipment in other areas. However, automatic equipment in itself is not a cure-all, nor have all its possibilities been developed. The production engineer's challenge in the application of automatic lease controls is to select the proper equipment to meet the specific operating problems of each field and to develop new equipment, as needed, to permit further mechanizing of routine production operationsHistorical NotesIn the early days of the oil industry there was little need for automatic control equipment to regulate production of crude oil. For example, in Col. Drake's time the major problem was finding a market for the meager amounts of oil which were produced. Even during the days of flush production at Spindle-top, there was no need for control mechanisms as the flow of oil was limited only by the capacity of the wells; and many good production men were sure that it was extremely bad practice t o shut in a well for any reason. As the oil industry grew, more became known about the production characteristics of oil wells, and the lease pumper began to have many responsibilities in producing his wells.The early 1930's marked the advent of our presenttechnology of petroleum which recognizes that proper control of production from individual wells is essential to efficient operation of oil reservoirs. Incorporation of this and other now firmly established principles of petroleum technology in the state-administered proration laws have since made it not only good business but a matter of law to control and record production from each well accurately and intelligently. Thus, the job of a lease pumper has grown from one that started largely a s a watcher over earthen pits full of oil to that of aproduction specialist, a bookkeeper, and a marketer of crude oil.Purpose of Automatic ControlsBecause the primary purpose of automatic controls to be discussed in this paper is to increase the productivity of the lease pumper-just a s machines have increased the productive capacity of the nation-a brief analysis of the duties of today's lease pumper is necessary to find where automatic controls can help. His duties may, and frequently include each of the following:Flow wells for definite periods.Pump wells for definite periods.Top-out lease stock tank.Switch tanks.Shut in lease production when equipment fails.Gage tanks and sell oil.Treat oil-water emulsions.Make individual well-production tests.Check performance of wells and lease equipment.Maintain proper well-producing rates.Service lease equipment.Make oral or written reports on any phase of lease activity.",,American Petroleum Institute

Fast(Stanolind Oil and Gas Company),,,,,,API-52-104,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"Experimental work on small cores and in shallow wells indicated that, by restricting pressure to the well bore by means of a suitable temporarily solid bridging material, it is possible to obtain a series of formation fractures which may be extended with the usual type of fracturing gels. The results of this laboratory work were confirmed by 23 experimental multiple-fracturing field tests conducted in 11 fields in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, and Louisiana. A review of the data obtained from these 23 wells showed that 87 percent of the wells treated responded with oil-production increases. The daily oil-production rate from these 23 wells was 1,157 bbl of oil per day before treatment as compared to 3,110 bbl of oil per day after treatment, which is approximately 270 percent of the pre-treatment production rate. The production rate of the 20 successfully treated wells was increased from 823 bbl of oil per day to 2,788 bbl of oil per day, or approximately 340 percent of the pre-treatment production rate. Multiple fractures were evidenced by multiple pressure breaks during treatments, and new zones of permeability were indicated by permeability profiles. The success of the treatments was substantiated by sustained oil-production increases as evidenced by productivity tests before and after treatment.INTRODUCTIONThe need for a method of increasing the permeability of producing formations to increase well productivity resulted in the development of the now commonly used Hydrafrac process.1This process consists essentially of three steps:I, injecting into the formation a viscous liquid, either hydrocarbon or water-base, generally containing a granular material such as sand for a propping agent, under high hydraulic pressure to fracture the formation;2, causing the viscous liquid to change from high to low viscosity so that it may be readily displaced from the formation; and3, flushing the treating chemicals from the formation by producing the well.During the first 3 years of commercial application, approximately 7,800 of 10,500 Hydrafrac treatments were successful in increasing well productivity.2Early in the development of the Hydrafrac process, the desirability of isolation of the treatment to a relatively thin section of the formation was realized. To accomplish the desired isolation, specially designed open-hole straddle packers were developed. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 treatments have been conducted through packers of this type.The Hydrafrac process has usually produced only a single fracture in each separately isolated zone because of the inability to increase pressure sufficiently to cause additional fracturing after the first fracture was formed. In wells with open-hole diameters too large for formation packers, isolation of the treatment to specific sections of the open hole has been impossible. Other wells have been difficult to treat because of poor casing cement, either around the shoe joint or between perforated sections, which has made effective isolation and treatment of a given section impossible. It was to combat these problems and, where possible, to obtain multiple fractures when the use of packers is impracticable that the multiple-fracturing method was developed.",,American Petroleum Institute
475,321020,,Factors Affecting the Classification of Oil and Gas wells,J.C. Allen(The Texas Company Research Division Bellaire Texas),,,,,,API-52-118,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"The physical properties of oil and gas reservoirs and the problems associated with the classification of oil and gas wells are reviewed. Experimental data on hydrocarbon mixtures from six fields are given. These fields are chosen as examples of gas-phase reservoirs, combination reservoirs, and liquid-phase reservoirs. Critical pressures and temperatures for 10 mixtures of hydrocarbons from the 6 fields are presented and the term critical ratio is suggested to identify those mixtures (gas-oil ratio) which exhibit a critical state at reservoir temperature. It is shown by these observations that a smooth transition from reservoirs of one type to reservoirs of another type exists. In the gas-oil ratio range of approximately 3,000 to 6,000 cu ft per bbl, the state in which reservoir fluids exist underground is uncertain and is dependent upon temperature, pressure, and the character of the produced gas and liquid.A Review of the Properties of Some Oil and Gas ReservoirsSince the first production of hydrocarbons. from underground reservoirs, the producing wells have been placed in two general categories, viz., oil and gas. The hydrocarbons produced have varied from field to field in composition and properties from asphaltic mixtures that are heavier than water to substantially pure methane, the lightest hydrocarbon gas. Gas fields were discovered which produced a water-white liquid at the well head, similar in many properties to motor fuel and was termed casinghead or natural gasoline. This type of underground gas contains heavier hydrocarbons than methane and these constituents condense at the surface because of the temperature dropping below the dew point of the system.With the advent of deeper drilling, new pools were discovered which produced gas and a liquid at the surface that was at first termed white oil because it was considerably heavier than the casinghead gasoline. It was shown that these white oils exist in the subsurface formation as a gas because of retrograde phenomena.1,2The produced liquid varies in color from water white to dark straw, and has gravity ranges from 47 to 66 API. Having similar properties to a refinery cut termed distillate, these wells were at first called distillate wells. The term condensate was later applied because the produced liquids are formed by retrograde condensation.Prior to the discovery of condensate reservoirs, the classification of fields was based solely upon the produced gas-oil ratio. An early gas-condensate reservoir discovery made this method of classification inadequate. In a paper presented at the AIME meeting held in Oklahoma City in October 1937, E. A. Stephenson3stated: A much more precise concept of the distinction between an oil well and a gas well was given in 1936 by the Federal Judges for the Western District of Texas (Austin Division) in the case of the Clymore Production Co. vs. E. 0. Thompson et al. (the Texas Railroad Commission). The plaintiff (Clymore) owned a few wells which were classified as oil wells, although these had gas-oil ratios of 86,500 cu ft per bbl. Gas a t the rate of 45 million cubic feet per day was being blown into the air in order to about 500 bbl of the crude oil",,American Petroleum Institute

Texas),,,,,,API-52-128,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"A total of 582 wells were producing as of October 1, 1951, and over 200 rigs were operating in the Spraberry trend. Of these producing wells, 41 percent were completed with a salt string set at approximately 4,000 ft. The standard practice is to set the liner or long string above the Spraberry sand before the pay interval is drilled. Practically all of the operators cement each string of casing in a single stage, circulating the slurry only behind the surface pipe. Mud problems are not considered serious; however, a light system must be maintained while drilling weak formations below 4,000 ft. The majority of the operators drill the pay interval with rotary tools, using crude oil as the circulating f1uid;although some of them prefer to drill the Spraberry with cable tools. Overall, 82 percent of the completed wells were Hydrafraced during the initial completion operation. The remaining 18 percent were shot, acidized, or completed naturally. The average period of time necessary to drill and complete a Spraberry well with rotary tools is approximately 36 to 40 days.INTRODUCTIONThe first Spraberry well was completed by the Seaboard Oil Company on January 22, 1949. This discovery well, the S. E. Lee No. 2 located in Dawson County, Texas, was drilled as an Ellenberger test; and upon finding no shows in this formation, it was plugged back and completed in the open hole in the upper Spraberry formation. Approximately six months later, the Tex Harvey Oil Company's B. W. Floyd No. 1-16 opened the Tex Harvey Field and paved the way for the discovery of Germania, Pembrook, Midkiff, Huddle-Manning, Smith, Glass, Driver, Weiner-Floyd, Benedum (Spraberry), Snowden. North Pembrook, Weddell, Aldwell, and Flatrock Fields in that order.This paper was originally prepared in October 1951 utilizing data available October 1 of that year. However. in order to show the most recent trends in development rate, Fig. 1 has been revised to include information available as of September 1,1952. On this latter date, 2,007 Spraberry wells had been completed and approximately 71 rigs were active in this area. The development rate for the month of August, 1952 experienced a rapid decline. This was due primarily to the steel strike, but it was also effected by operators who are reluctant to develop on 40-acre proration units.As previously stated, this paper is based upon information available October 1. 1951. Notwithstanding that a greater portion of development has occurred since that date, the majority of the operators are still following one or more of the drilling and completion techniques outlined herein.During the early stages of development it became apparent that many, or possibly all, of the foregoing fields would eventually prove to be one vast reservoir. In order to prevent additional complication in naming new fields with different field rules, the Railroad Commission issued an order whereby future discoveries will carry the name of the nearest producing Spraberry field. Discovery allowables may still be granted when these discoveries are three miles or further from a producing area.As of October 1, 1951, 582 wells were producing and over 200 rigs were operating. A survey conducted in October 1951 recorded 203 operators in the Spraberry area. It will not be possible to cover here every variation in drilling and completion technique practiced by all operators. Consequently, only the more general procedures used by the majority will be presented",,American Petroleum Institute

True(Humble Oil and Refining Company),,,,,,API-52-138,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"To provide means for eliminating much of the fatigue and many of the hazards on the part of drilling crews in making round trips, an improved type of semi-automatic, power-operated drilling machinery has been developed after years of research and field testing, which permits round trips to be made without drill pipe being touched by hand. One unit of the latest design of this equipment, which is the outgrowth of the original set of the semi-automatic equipment recently field tested, is currently in field service. The equipment consists of hydraulically and pneumatically operated tongs which perform the spinning and tonging operations, and the pneumatically operated racking units mounted in the derrick for carrying the pipe to and from the center of the hole and positioning it on the mat and in the rack. With this equipment, all of the operations of the various units are controlled remotely by manipulation of hydraulic and pneumatic valve levers.INTRODUCTIONA great amount of work has been done to increase the speed and efficiency of drilling operations and to reduce the fatigue of rig crews. As a result, automatic and semi-automatic powered equipment is eing used to perform more of the routine operations encountered in drilling wells. Air slips have found wide acceptance throughout the drilling industry and automatic drilling, or feed-off, controls as well as air brakes are gaining favor. Now, after several years of research and field testing, equipment has been developed which permits making round trips with drill pipe with only the expenditure of the effort required for actuation of controls. One complete set of the remotely controlled, power-operated drill-pipe tongs, spinner, stabber, pipe rackers, elevator, and traveling-block deflector has been manufactured and is currently in field service. The latest design of this equipment is the outgrowth of the original set of the semi-automatic equipment field tested in the Gulf Coast area of Texas during 1948 and 1949. The original experimental semiautomatic equipment, described in a previous paper,1which was used for drilling approximately 75,000 ft of hole over a period of 18 months, was similar in many respects t o the latest model and served a s a basis for the final design.Remotely controlled, hydraulically powered tongs, which are suspended from a telescoping arm clamped to a derrick leg, perform the spinning and tonging operations and assist in stabbing the pipe. Single stands of pipe, before becoming a part of, or upon being removed from, the string of pipe in the hole are supported and positioned by semi-automatic, powered machinery, independent of the main hoisting equipment. This work is performed by an auxiliary hoist, mounted near the top of the derrick, and an upper and lower racker, mounted between the 10th and 11th girts and above the first girt, respectively. The hoist supports the weight of the stand and provides for vertical movement, while mechanical arms and hands on the two rackers guide the pipe to its proper position. Opening of the main pipe elevator is controlled by an operator on the derrick floor by means of compressed air; and closing is accomplished by a trigger which, on contacting pipe, holds the elevators open and springs compressed. To permit simultaneous movement of the traveling block and of the auxiliary equipment handling a single stand of pipe, a traveling-block deflector has been provided. Thus, the traveling block can make a trip up or down along the side of the derrick, without a load, while a stand of pipe in the center of the derrick is being made up or broken out; and idle time of all of the equipment is appreciably reduced.",,American Petroleum Institute

Zaba(StanolInd Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-52-148,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"This paper is a progress report of the Mid-Continent District Study Committee on Artificial Lifting of Deep Wells. For the purpose of study of this committee, a deep well has been defined as one having the working fluid level at or below 7,000 ft, regardless of size of production, or one having the working fluid level at or below 5,000 R and producing more than 500 bbl of fluid per day. During the two years of its existence, the committee collected pertinent data on this type of well through a questionnaire sent to 14 oil companies. Within the area covered by the survey and comprising the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent, and Southwestern Districts, these companies operate a total of 46,733 artificially lifted wells of which 339, or 0.725 percent, were reported as deep wells now in actual operation. The operators questionnaire was quite detailed, asking for both well and equipment data. A comprehensive questionnaire was sent also to 34 companies manufacturing equipment capable of lifting the deep wells. Presented herein are the results of the survey and the committee's general comments on the data secured. Because of the magnitude of the undertaking and because not all answers to the questionnaire were complete, no detailed analysis of the data was possible, and no specific conclusions could be arrived at. The committee recommends that this work be continued, preferably on a national basis; and that during the next two-year period the information secured be analyzed in more detail and the suggested field tests be performed to secure data which would contribute toward better understanding and solution of the problem of artificially lifting deep wells.INTRODUCTIONThis paper represents a report on the work done by the Mid-Continent District Study Committee on Artificial Lifting of Deep Wells during the two years of its existence, and is a result of work of all members of the committee.The committee feels that the work done so far, primarily an accumulation of a substantial amount of factual data through questionnaires, was necessarily the first step in the study of the problem which is of increasing importance to the oil industry. It is hoped that this work will be continued.Completion of a survey, made on a scale such as the one attempted by this committee, requires considerable time. As a result, the committee did not have an opportunity to make a thorough critical analysis of all the data secured, nor to correlate the information furnished by the operators and the manufacturers. It was believed, however, that the information obtained by the survey, and general comments on the more important aspects of these data, are of sufficient interest to justify their presentation. Files of the committee, containing detailed results of the survey, are available for a more thorough analysis, which is suggested as the next step in the continuation of this work. A general summary of the results of the survey, suggestions, and comments are presented in the body of the paper. A more detailed summary and partial analysis of the replies to the operators' and manufacturers questionnaires is included in an appendix",,American Petroleum Institute
479,321024,,Trend in Use of Low-weight Cement Slurried,C.D. Saunders(Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.)|F.W. Nussbaumer(Hallibuton Oil Well Cementing Co. Abilene Texas.),,,,,,API-52-189,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"The various problems encountered during the primary cementing of oil-well casing have encouraged the development of better cementing materials for obtaining satisfactory cementing jobs with fewer stages. This development work has resulted in the acceptance of lighter-weight, lower-strength cementing slurries which offer advantages over the more conventional neat-cement slurries weighing 15 to 16 lb per gal. These slurries are being prepared with high percentages of bentonite and expanded perlite. Slurry weights from 12 1/2 to 17 lb per gal are possible with satisfactory set properties for sealing the casing in the well. This paper gives data concerning the properties of cementing slurries prepared with these additives, and the manner in which they are used in the field.Today the entire oil industry is investigating cementing problems in a thorough and scientific manner. This has been necessitated by the advent of deeper drilling with the attendant problems of high temperature and pressure, and by the fact that more wells are being completed by setting through the producing zones and perforating for production.General field conditions are now such that cementing materials are being used in wells varying from extremely shallow depths to 20,000 ft with temperatures of 60 F. to approximately 400 F. and at pressures ranging from 100 to 18,000 psi or more. In addition t o these general conditions, there are specific well problems which further increase the diversified requirements for the cementing materials.It is vitally important to the successful completion of most wells t o have the casing sealed in place with a good cement job; a good cement job being one that completely fills the annular space between the casing and the wells of the hole, to the desired height, with a cementitious material that will set within a reasonable time and which has enough strength to hold the casing rigidly in place, and to prevent migration of fluids from one level to another in this annular space. Vast sums have been spent drilling wells which have been lost because good cementing jobs were not achieved.Many improvements have been made in the last decade in cementing equipment, tools, and procedures. In the past, little attention was given the type of cement slurry used in cementing operations, with neat-cement slurries (those containing only cement and water) being used in most cases. This was particularly true when most jobs were run using sack cement. With the advent of bulk handling of oil-well cements, it has become possible to blend various materials to cement in practically any proportions desired. It is now possible to admix materials to cement which will produce a wide range of properties, thus making it possible to tailor make a cement to fit a specific well condition.PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTSIn order to make desired changes, the physical requirements for cementing materials had to be investigated and accepted by the industry. Many oil and service companies began working along this line and are, in general, in good agreement on many of these properties, which include:Lower or proper strengths.Lighter slurry weights.Better perforating qualities.More volume per sack of cement.Better control of lost circulation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-52-214,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"This paper classifies sucker-rod joint failures, analyzes the stresses involved in the standard API joint, attempts to explain the cause of the breaks that occur, and suggests possible remedies for the situation. A new undercut joint is explained, which is now under field test. This new undercut pin is of such design that it can be made from present sucker-rod pin forgings. An entirely new joint is also proposed, and the reasoning for its presumed superiority is given Sucker-rod joint failures have always been a source of grief to the oil producer; and will continue to be until someone devises a better joint, far less vulnerable to fatigue than the present API standard. However, an understanding of the nature of the failure, and the stresses and contributing factors involved, can aid materially in reducing the incidence of such failures even with our present standard joint.Classes of FailuresAll joint failures fall in one of four classes:1, completely unscrewing in service;2, wear as illustrated in Fig. 1;3, failure resulting from workmanship or material defects; and4, fatigue of metal, usually accelerated by corrosion. The first two suggest their own remedy. The third, fortunately, is extremely rare and it, too, suggests its own remedy. In the hundreds of joint failures examined by the writer, no breaks have been found in the pin proper or in the coupling which are definitely chargeable to original defects, with the exception of one pin failure where the coupling face was 0.017 in. out of parallel with the pin shoulder face. A few pin ends broken in the wrench square, as indicated by an mow in Fig. 2, have been inspected. All such are definitely caused by forging defects.The fourth class, or the break resulting from fatigue failure, represents about 90 percent of the source of trouble and is, of course, the hardest to understand or combat. The nature and cause of fatigue failures is not within the scope of this paper. Very able and comprehensive literature on the subject is available.1I, lowering the stress as by increasing the metal area;2, decreasing the rate of corrosion, as by use of inhibitors;3, decreasing the range of stress; and4, eliminating stress raisers such as sharp notches placed at critical points. Fig. 3 is a graph which shows the relationship between fatigue life, both in air and in brine, and magnitude of stress; and Fig. 4 shows the Goodman diagram2which illustrates the effect of range of stress.Before going further in discussing actual failures and means of combating them, it would be well to have a clear understanding of the quality and quantity of stresses involved in the sucker-rod joint under both static and dynamic conditions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Murphy(Continental Oil Company .),,,,,,API-52-226,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"This paper defines and discusses the various factors contributing to the performance of oil reservoirs. Porosity, permeability; and interstitial water are described as reservoir-rock characteristics which, together with the fluid characteristics, affect reservoir operation. The functions of solution gas, gas-cap gas, and water in the production of oil are explained. The field measurements of oil gas, and water production are shown to be the critical factors in describing reservoir performance. The conclusions of a reservoir-engineering study are no better than field-measured data which enter into the calculations, and operating expense can be considerably reduced if production data are accurately measured and reported.INTRODUCTIONMillions of dollars are being spent each year in research activities directed toward a better and more fundamental knowledge of reservoir performance-. The technology of reservoir engineering now embraces the fields of physics, chemistry, geology, mathematics, and the not-to-be-disregarded fields of philosophy and metaphysics. In fact, the basic equation relating the physical aspects of the movement of reservoir fluids is so complicated that it has yet to be adequately solved.In spite of all this research activity and the millions of dollars spent annually, the reservoir engineer has no substitute for reliable, accurate field-performance data. Regardless of the precision of the formulas and their ability to predict the future behavior of a reservoir, the historical data, including oil, gas, and water production and bottom-hole pressure, will always be the controlling factors in the studies of oil- and gas-field performanceDISCUSSIONIt is not a mere presumption that the most important measured basic data relative to the performance of reservoirs are the volumes of oil, gas, and water being produced and the pressure existing in the reservoir. Of course, it is good, and frequently quite important, to know the relative volumes and the physical and chemical relationships of the oil, gas, and water as they exist in the reservoir. However, this information is not always obtainable and frequently one has only the measurement of the volumes of the liquids as they are gaged at the surface.One of the most used (and also misused) theorems of reservoir engineering is the so-called material-balance equation. This states that oil, gas, and water produced from a reservoirplusthe oil, gas, and water left in the reservoir areequalto the oil, gas, and water that originally existed in the reservoir. This is a very simple but a very important concept. It will be noted that three of the factors are the oil, gas, and water produced and the accuracy of data concerning these factors is the direct responsibility of the field personnel.It is impossible to discuss adequately all of the uses for reliable field and well-performance data. For the purpose of this paper, an attempt will. be made to demonstrate the effect of field measurements on reservoir-engineering calculations and the resultant decisions of management. First, it might be worthwhile to define several important terms used by engineers and geologists so that their tie-in to field predictions will be better understood.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hayes(BlackSivalls and Bryson Inc.),,,,,,API-52-318,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"The search for better production methods to increase revenue from gas-condensate wells has led to employment of low-temperature separation and a process for stabilizing the liquid recovery from that process. In the past, wherever possible, natural gasoline plants have been used to extract greater yields from gas-condensate production. Low-temperature separation will yield separator-liquid recovery comparable to gasoline-plant extraction. This liquid is rich in both the lighter and the normally liquid hydrocarbons. By fractionating the separator liquid under controlled pressure and temperature, practically all of the stable components are produced to and remain in storage. In many cases, further refinements to produce gasoline and liquefied petroleum gases can be added economically. Data presented herein show the advantage of producing stabilized condensate, natural gasoline, and liquefied petroleum gases at the lease. A large investment is required to drill a gas-condensate well. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain the maximum revenue economically available from each well. The revenue from a well can be increased in two principal ways:Market more pounds of products from the total pounds of fluid produced from the well.Convert the production from the well into more desirable products.Some steps which can be taken on the lease to accomplish these means are:Remove the maximum volume of hydrocarbon from the gaseous phase of the wellstream.Retain the maximum volume of separated hydrocarbon liquids in atmospheric storage.Salvage a maximum amount of light vapors from the separated liquid.Convert the separated liquid hydrocarbons into natural gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, and residue oil.In this paper a discussion of some methods by which increased revenue can be economically accomplished in the production of gas-condensate wells and some typical operating data are presented. The methods to be discussed are:Low-temperature separation of condensate from natural gas.Lease stabilization of condensate from low temperature separators.Production of natural gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)The foregoing methods are also applicable to casinghead gas streams which require mechanical refrigeration to cool the stream to the desired separation temperature. These three methods are not separate one from the other. Lease stabilization is a natural sequence to increase the effectiveness of low-temperature separation. Lease production of natural gasoline and LPG is a simple step after stabilization. How many of these steps which should be .taken on any specific lease is determined by an economic study for that lease Low-temperature Separation Low-temperature separation as a basis for stabilization, natural gasoline, and LPG recovery systems of this type must meet strict economic considerations as follows:Flexibility of design to achieve the best balance of efficiency to plant cost.Flexibility of operation under widely varying load conditions.Simple automatic control with maximum safety to insure minimum operating attention and cost.High salvage, portability, and expansion possibilities.Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of a low-temperature separation system where hydrates are allowed to form in the separator and are directed into a body of warm liquid where they are melted.

By weighting the amplitudes using Gaussian beams around these rays the stacking of amplitudes is restricted to physically relevant regions only. Event locations correspond to regions of maximum amplitudes in the resulting image. We show a successful application of the method to a synthetic data example with a noise level of 20 per cent.

The objective of this paper is to present, from the California viewpoint, a survey of present concepts of desirable drilling-mud practice. Such a compilation can serve as a reference work for the occasional user of mud information; and, for the mud engineer, serves as an interesting yardstick with which to compare his own experience. An attempt also has been made to point out the shortcomings of present muds and mud information to be used as a guide for future effort on the part of research men and commercial suppliers of mud materials and services. The present work is the result of numerous conferences of the authors with industry representatives and also presents the results of a written questionnaire survey sent to all operating members of the API Pacific Coast District Study Committee on Drilling Fluids.

485,321029,,Design and Development of Improved Annular Survey Equipment and Techniquest,George H. Reneau(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-52-349,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"This paper presents a review of the annulus survey techniques and improved annulus survey tubing-head designs as developed in the Elk Basin Field. The Elk Basin designed tubing heads provide sufficient clearance in wells equipped with 7-in. casing and 2 1/2-in. tubing (external upset or non-upset) for a 1 1/4-in. survey instrument to realign with the lubricator as it approaches the surface, thus eliminating the previous practice of bleeding off casing pressure and lifting the tubing string to free an instrument fouled by coiling line. The economics of converting well-head equipment on 28 wells in the Elk Basin Tensleep reservoir is also indicated, with approximately 80 percent payout being realized during the initial survey. The paper provides details for adapting the annulus entry tubing-head design to packer-type as well as to flange-type heads, thus providing an economical conversion for a great variation of wellhead equipment. The prime purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the ease and low cost of obtaining accurate reservoir-pressure data by bottom-hole gage measurements throughout the life of a field, even though artificial-lift methods may restrict passage of bottom-hole survey instrumentsINTRODUCTIONThe importance of accurate reservoir-pressure data throughout the life of a field is becoming recognized more and more as modern production practices tend toward greater conservation and increased recovery efficiencies. An outstanding example of this is evident in the history of the Tensleep reservoir of the Elk Basin Field in Wyoming. Initial bottom-hole pressure data proved to be of great assistance to the many operators of this field in the preparation of background data for unitization negotiations. Data obtained from subsequent annual pressure surveys indicated the trend of primary depletion, and thereby demonstrated the importance of a pressure-maintenance program. The continuation of annual pressure surveys in the reservoir under pressure maintenance indicates the extent of pressure restoration and provides a continual check on the gas-oil interface, thus affording basic data for determining recovery efficiency and calculating reserves.One great obstacle has always prevented many companies from continuing reservoir study based on reliable reservoir pressure data, viz., the installation of pumps and rod strings. Some operators have considered this data in certain reservoirs to be worth the additional expense, and have continued a more or less limited survey by pulling rods from wells to allow for passage of the bottom-hole pressure gage. This practice has been followed in the Elk Basin Tensleep reservoir with pumping wells increasing in number until it was necessary to pull rods from 27 of the 37 wells included in the 1950 pressure survey. This survey involved an expenditure of $6,300 for well-pulling expense alone.The possibility of obtaining accurate bottom-hole pressure information by other means has been investigated, but none have proved satisfactory or practical under the conditions confronted in Elk Basin. The accuracy of pressure data obtained by the acoustic well sounder depends upon the ability to accurately estimate the gradient of annulus fluids, the reliability of tubular records, and the exact detection of a distinct fluid level. Another method, only slightly considered because of its experimental status, was the permanent installation of a bottom-hole electrical pressure cell. Among the many disadvantages of this type of equipment, are the difficulty in insulating or isolating a rod or tubing string to the surface for an electrical conductor and the necessity of pulling the well to service or calibrate the pressure cell.",,American Petroleum Institute

However, the accomplishment of this objective is largely dependent upon management's success in training, developing, encouraging, and leading manpower which is unquestionably the industry's greatest asset. There are a number of successful methods being used to develop good managers. Among the best of these are the understudy and the job-rotation plans. Another method which is proving particularly effective is. a management development training course covering the five basic functions of management-Planning, Organizing, Directing, Coordinating,andControlling. The course also illustrates the application of these functions to the utilization of capital, manpower, facilities, and materials.The art of developing petroleum managers involves some consideration of the responsibilities of petroleum management. In the author's opinion, these shape up as follows:First, management is responsible to the public and to the government for providing a steady, dependable flow of high-quality petroleum products. Our marketing departments have done a magnificent job in selling the country petroleum products. Today, with over 50 million motor vehicles, 4 l million tractors, and an ever-increasing industrial load, this is truly a nation on wheels-wheels powered with oil, lubricated with oil.

We have taught the American public and American industry to depend on us, and we had better make it our business to see that the motorist gets plenty of good gasoline at the service station; that the farmer has plenty of fuel for his tractors; industry plenty of products for plants; and armed services plenty of what it takes to operate planes, tanks, and ships.Second, petroleum management is responsible to its employees-almost 2 million of them. We have to see that they get steady employment at wages that are competitive-wages high enough to provide families with the comforts and even some of the luxuries that we have come to know as the American way of living. We want to help them when they are sick or injured, to provide their families with insurance when they die, to assist them in achieving an independent income when they retire. A great many of our people make employment with our industry a lifetime career; and, to the maximum extent possible, we want to give them opportunity, training, and encouragement to develop themselves to the limit of their abilities.Finally, our management is responsible to stockholders. Make no mistake about it, management has to make a profit for the stockholders; for without profit, we cannot maintain the supply of products we have underwritten nor take care of our employees in the style to which they are accustomed.Capital requirements in our industry are almost incredible. You have seen figures for individual companies covering the investment in plant, property, and equipment range from $20,000 to $75,000 per man on the payroll. In fact, the total invested in the oil industry exceeds 33 billion dollars. This is the kind of money it takes to continue the search for oil, build pipe lines, erect plants, provide distribution facilities. It is up to management to earn a decent return on this tremendous investment, see that the people who have risked their dollars in our venture get compensated for the use of their capital, and still have something left over for development",,American Petroleum Institute

Current operating practices, such as logging, drilling mechanics, cementing, well completion, and others, growing out of research are reviewed Possible future trends toward attaining the objective of drilling and production research, viz., get more and more oil at less and less cost, are discussed. It is emphasized that research development is worthless unless properly applied and integrated into operations.In this continuously expanding oil industry, much talk has been heard in the past, and no doubt will be heard in the future, about the nation running out of oil. Yet for all except 4 years out of the last 33 and every year since 1933, more oil has been added to our reserves each year than had been withdrawn. Of course, much credit for this is due to research in exploration; but of increasing importance is the contribution made by research and development directed toward drilling and production practice.Although this analysis is concerned principally with trends within oil-industry research laboratories, it is fully recognized that much of the progress in the past has resulted from research and development work conducted by many other organizations, e. g., the steel industry, oil-field specialty companies, logging firms, service companies, U. S. Bureau of Mines, universities, and many industry- sponsored projects placed in non-industrial organizations.The question today is twofold: First, how has research and development in the past made an impact on operating practice at this time; and, second, in what ways might production research significantly contribute to practice in the near future?SOME INDICATIONS OF GROWTH IN RESEARCH EFFORTBefore recalling some of the principal contributions of production research to operations, it might be interesting to observe some index as to the intensity of the research effort during the past 15 years. Seven major oil companies were questioned as to the number of scientifically trained people employed by them in organized research on drilling and production problems in 1937, 1947, and as of August 1952. The composite figures are shown below.(Available in full paper)These figures are relative and, of course, serve only to orient our conception-of what is happening in the oil industry concerning the emphasis being placed on production research. Noteworthy also is the fact that in the past two or three years, several companies have announced the creation of a program on production research, which companies previously had very little research work directed toward this field. It is evident from the foregoing comparison that there has been an increase of over 600 percent in organized research in the 7 laboratories consulted during the last 15 years; and it is probably safe to conclude that, during the last 5 years, organized research in oil-industry laboratories has doubled.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dyes(The Atlantic Refining Company),,,,,,API-52-383,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1952,"The Spraberry formation, although it gives a very poor primary recovery, would not be suitable for gas or water injection by conventional standards because its high degree of f'racturing, coupled with its very tight matrix material, would be expected to cause excessive channeling However, the Spraberry rock tends to soak up water with the release of oil; and' the large fracture system provides a conducting system to bring injected water into contact with large areas of the matrix. This leads to the suggestion of awater-imbibition displacementprocess for the Spraberry, set up with a pattern of injection and producing wells similar to that for conventional water flooding, but controlled by the natural-imbibition rate into the matrix. A unique feature of the process is that the produced water oil ratio will be a function of the water-injection rate and the imbibition rate rather than solely of the degree of depletion as in conventional flooding. Laboratory studies on rates of natural imbibition, coupled with estimates of the extent of fracturing, indicate that the process may be carried on at commercially economic rates and that it will result in a threefold increase in recovery over that for natural depletion. A field test is being undertaken to confirm the feasibility of the process.INTRODUCTIONAlthough the Spraberry trend contains very large quantities of oil, the rapid decline of the well productivity attended by rising gas-oil ratios has been a cause of considerable concern to operators there. The estimated recovery, which is less than 10 percent of the oil in place, indicates the necessity of some alternate method of production which will give a higher recovery . Conventional water flooding is generally recognized to be impractical. This is because most of the oil is stored in a very tight matrix, whereas most of the permeability is the result of a large number of fractures.1,2,3,,4Thus, conventional water flooding with water flowing from the injection well through the matrix to the producing well is out of the question. Channeling would be extremely serious. It would be even more serious for gas injection.Inasmuch as channeling is inevitable, the thought has occurred that the fracture system provides a ready access t o large areas of the matrix; and that, if the fractures were filled with water, natural imbibition, or the tendency of water to soak into rock, might provide an economic means for producing Oil from the Spraberry. Early qualitative tests gave support to the idea when it was found that pieces of Spraberry matrix saturated with Oil and placed in a beaker of water rapidly formed droplets of oil over the rock surface. This indicated that the water was imbibing into the rock and the oil was oozing out of the same surface into which the water was entering (Fig. 1).",,American Petroleum Institute

Halderson(Philips Petroleum Company Bartleville Okla.),,,,,,API-53-210,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1953,"basic science has not yet been applied to the problem of sucker-rod pumping. Consequently, the problem is still unsolved. Defining the problem in terms of the fundamental equations that govern the behavior of a sucker-rod pumping system shows that an analogue or a simulator is required to solve the problem. The simulator could be one of several types. Evidence is presented to show that an electric simulator might be used. Limitations of present procedures for designing sucker-rod systems are described and illustrated; and the benefits that will result from solving the problem are outlined.INTRODUCTIONThe objectives of this presentation are to point out the limitations of the present procedures for designing and operating sucker-rod pumping systems, to outline the way by which these limitations can be eliminated, and to list a number of the benefits that will result from solving the problem of the sucker rod pumping system.A recent survey of an API subcommittee indicated that today 86 percent of all artificially lifted oil wells are equipped with sucker-rod pumps. Further, a survey made by an API study group on the artificial lifting of deep wells showed that more sucker-rod pumping systems are used to lift production from deep wells than any other type of artificial lift. Much effort has been expended in developing other methods of lifting oil, some of which have been advantageous under certain conditions, but there is no evidence that sucker-rod pumping will be displaced from its present position of importance.The present place of sucker-rod pumping has been achieved by the continued effort of the industry to improve the equipment and to obtain a better under standing of the behavior of the system. There are reasons for believing, however, that the ultimate in the design and operation of sucker-rod pumping systems has not been reached and that further improvement and economy can be effected.There has been a tremendous amount of time and money spent on various aspects of the sucker-rod pumping problem. This time and money has largely been spent in making tests and taking measurements in the field in an attempt to empirically determine the behavior of the sucker-rod system. The past approach to the sucker-rod pumping problem has contributed about all that it can to the design and operation of sucker-rod pumping systems, as evidenced by the fact that there has been little or no progress along this line in the past 10 years. If progress is to continue, and if the problem of lifting oil from increasingly greater depths is to be intelligently handled, a more fundamental approach must supplement the empirical procedure of the past. Such progress cannot be made without a better understanding of the basic fundamentals of the sucker-rod pumping problem.The Sucker-rod Pumping ProblemIn a number of instances, past theoretical work on the sucker-rod pumping problenl has been based on the assumption that the sucker-rod system is",,American Petroleum Institute

Woods(Hughes Tool Co.),,,,,,API-53-222,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1953,"When conditions are not varied during the drilling of a bore hole, the hole assumes a constant angle of inclination. When conditions vary, the hole changes direction and eventually assumes another angle. Mathematical relationships are established giving the forces on the bit, the dog-legging tendency, and the inclination toward which the hole tends as functions of drill-collar size, hole size, weight on bit, dip of the formation, stabilizers, etc. Conclusions are reached concerning economical means of fighting crooked-hole conditions.INTRODUCTIONOne of the co-authors presented a paper on buckling of rotary drilling strings1at the 1950 spring meeting of the Mid-Continent District. Later, the other co-author pointed out that the previous study concerned a straight and vertical hole and suggested that a similar study be made for inclined holes not only in homogeneous formations, but also in stratified formations; either horizontal or inclined. This was done in the present paper.In the first part of the paper, the forces acting on a bit are analyzed. Later, the properties of the formations being drilled will be studied; and they, combined with the forces acting on the bit, will be used to determine the relation between the angle or change of angle of inclination of the bore hole and the factors that influence them. This paper is based on mathematical derivations which are given in the appendix.DIRECTION OF THE FORCE ON BITConsider a drilling string in a straight, but not vertical, hole as shown in Fig. 1. At the vicinity of the bit, the string does not contact the wall of the hole. At some distance above the bit, the drilling string contacts the wall of the hole at a point designated as point of tangency. Above the point of tangency, the string lies on the low side of the hole With no weight on the bit, the only force acting on the bit is the result of the weight of the portion of the string between the bit and the tangency point. This force tends to bring the hole toward vertical. hen weight is applied, there is another force on the bit which tends to direct the hole away from vertical. The resultant of these two forces may be in such a direction as to increase angle, to decrease angle, or to maintain constant angle.The derivation of a relationship between the direction of the force on the bit and all the variables that affect it is given in the appendix. The relationship itself is plotted in Fig. 2.This derivation is based upon the assumption that the drilling string lies on the low side of the hole as shown in Fig. 1. Actually, for some conditions, the drilling, string will not lie along the low side, but will buckle helically. It will be shown later herein that in actual drilling conditions this situation occurs only exceptionally and the foregoing assumption is correct.",,American Petroleum Institute

Midland Texas),,,,,,API-53-251,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1953,"This paper briefly discusses the history of gas injection projects in West Texas, from the initial project in 1930 to the present time. The data presented indicates that the use of gas injection as a .means of increasing recoverable oil from sandstone, limestone, and dolomite reservoirs in this area has become more attractive to a number of operators in recent years. For 12 years prior to 1942, all gas , was injected into sandstone formations at relatively shallow depths. In recent years the trend has been toward injecting into limestone and dolomite formations, at increasing depths and at higher injection pressures. Also, larger daily volumes, on an individual project basis, are being injected today than formerly. As an example, one company has a project under full pressure maintenance with the injected volume of gas equaling about 150 percent of the gas produced from the reservoir.INTRODUCTlONThe region commonly referred to as the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico comprises a surface area of approximately 40,000 square miles and is generally elliptical in shape, with its long axis running northwest-southeast. This major structure i s about 400 miles long and extends into the state of New Mexico for a distance of about 100 miles. At the close of 1952,this important oil-producing area contained in excess of 1%-million acres of proved oil land, and had produced almost 4'4 billion barrels of oil since its first discovery well in 1927. Also, its 43,500 active wells were producing oil and gas from all geological ages from the Cambrian through the Permian; For the present, this area is accounting for about one fifth of the nation's crude-oil production.It has been estimated by some authorities that the oil reservoirs of the Permian age alone in West Texas originally contained some 26.2 billion barrels of oil, an amount substantially greater than the accepted primary recoverable reserve of the United States. The report1 stated that 11.7 billion barrels of this oil occurs in rocks which will never be recovered by primary means, or by presently known secondary-recovery means. Of the remaining 14.5 billion barrels of oil, only 4.8 billion will be produced by primary recovery (using recovery efficiency of 32.9 percent) which means these great reservoirs will still contain some 9.7 billion barrels of oil and will be recovered only by the application of secondary methods.Early records indicate the first attempt to inject gas into an oil sand for the purpose of increasing production occurred in about 1890 in Venango County, Pennsylvania. This took place by accident when an oil well had been deepened to a lower sand to obtain gas for lease purposes. After the well was deepened into the Speechley sand and a substantial gas supply was found, the operator shut the well in because of not having enough pipe or a packer available. During the period the well was closed in, gas from the lower sand was permitted to enter the upper oil sand and an immediate improvement in the offset producing wells was noticed. This improvement continued until casing was run into the gas well and entry of gas into the oil sand was stopped. After that time, the nearby producing wells settled back down to their previous normal level.The offset operator, remembering the effect of the gas on the oil production of his neighbor, purposely turned the Speechly sand gas into one of his oil wells. The gas-injection pressure was about 100psi. The oil production in his nearby wells more than doubled almost immediately and the entire lease production increased for a short time from 360 bbl to 750 bbl of oil per day. Gas injection continued for a period of about six months, at which time",,American Petroleum Institute

Nowak(Union Oil Co.of California Research Center)|J.E. Klipp(Sunray Oil Corporation),,,,,,API-53-261,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1953,"An examination of 10,464 California wire-line core analyses shows an expected dependence of the residual- oil saturation on the reservoir oil-water viscosity ratio. A similar dependence is evident in flood-pot residuals, and in Mid-Continent field residuals by both water drive and gas drive. However, the correlation is semi-quantitative only in the low oil-viscosity range, the deviations being so large in the range of high-viscosity oils a s to make the use of wire-line core residual-oil content as a criterion of floodability for the heavier oils not recommended. A tentative border line at 3,000-ft depth or 30 for the oil-water viscosity ratio, is mentioned as being useful until more exact limits can be established for the range of wire-line data that may prove useful for deciding on floodability.INTRODUCTIOINAs the availability of oil by primary depletion methods begins to fall below the demand, two course s are open, viz., new fields may be sought, or greater recovery may be sought from known fields. Starting in the east and gradually working its way west, there has been a steadily growing trend toward increasing the recovery from known pools by secondary means. The most efficient of these, where applicable, is water flooding. Not all pools are equally susceptible to the efficient recovery of oil by water flooding, there being several physical properties that make flooding economically unfeasible. The evaluation of these factors may be carried out by laboratory methods or by actually developing a pilot flooding project in the field. Laboratory work is helpful in picking the best prospects for pilot-plant or full-scale flooding. Its cost is a very small fraction of that of even a pilot flood, and in many cases can render a definite recommendation as to whether or not a given oil pool will react favorably and economically to water injection. The usual laboratory method is the flood-pot evaluation involving conventional cores. Flood-pot tests determine chiefly the minimum residual-oil content after water flooding. If the operator knows the present oil content of his pool, a knowledge of this residual after flooding will tell him the future recovery of secondary oil, as a basis of an economic study of the adaptability of this sand to flooding. The aim of the present investigation is to determine whether the floodability of an oil sand can be predicted from other tests, such as the routine analysis of wire-line cores cut with water-base mud. For the present paper, floodability is defined as the ability of a water drive through an oil sand to reduce the oil saturation. The reasoning which led to the examination of Water-base wire-line core oil content as a possible criterion of floodability was that wire-line cores may be flushed during the coring process to a minimum residual-oil content comparable to that obtained in the flood-pot evaluation. The factors which control the oil content of a wire-line core are numerous and are interrelated in a rather complex manner.",,American Petroleum Institute

Clark Jr.(The Western Company),,,,,,API-54-206,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"In conventional hydraulic-fracturing practices the formation is initially broken down with a non-viscous crude oil. The fractures created are extended by injecting a quantity of fracturing oil containing sand. Fractures created by this procedure, using a non-viscous breakdown fluid, usually occur along bedding planes and are normally horizontal Horizontal fractures are limited in their ability to increase oil and gas production, are ineffective in formations having normal horizontal permeability and little or no vertical permeability, and are not considered good practice where water-flooding or other secondary-recovery operations are anticipated. A method has been developed by Continental Oil Company to produce vertical fractures. The method permits vertically fracturing a complete open-hole section, thus effectively increasing the fracture extensions. The superiority of vertical fracturing Over horizontal fracturing in formations of low vertical permeability has been established by sustained increased production rates.INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing has in the past few years proved most effective for stimulating oil- and gas-well production, having been successful in 75 per- cent1of the wells treated to date. It has also been noted that fracturing operations through perforations have proved more successful than conventional fracturing of open-hole sections, particularly when the sand contains shale streaks or impermeable barriers.Fundamental studies2,3of hydraulic fracturing have revealed that the presence of shale in a producing formation usually results in a fracture forming along the shale-sand interface. Fracturing of such wells In shale-sand formations is often unsuccessful, because the fracture opens only one portion of the formation to the well bore. This fact prompted Continental oil Company to undertake a laboratory study on the feasibility of fracturing across the sand and shale laminations, thus opening the entire pay formation to the well bore:Theory and Laboratory StudyIf the breakdown fluid can be confined to the well bore, the resultant fracture usually will extend vertically along the axis of the well.) All sand stringers into which the well has penetrated will be fractured, allowing each sand stringer to contribute its production more easily to the well bore.The formation of vertical fractures in sand sections interbedded with shales was studied in the laboratory. Cores 4 in. in diameter were selected from a Wyoming sand, Illustrated in Fig. 1. A hole of 3/8-in. diameter was drilled down through the center of each core to simulate a well bore. Using various materials as breakdown fluids, the sample cores were hydraulically fractured. Fractures across bedding planes were recorded as vertical fractures and fractures along bedding planes as horizontal fractures, inasmuch as most shale-sand interfaces occur along horizontal bedding planes. The data from these tests are presented in Table 1. It may be seen from Table 1 that hydraulic fracturing with a low-viscosity breakdown fluid will result in horizontal fracturing in a sand formation containing interbedded shales. Generally, higher pressures were required to cause the cores to break vertically, as shown by the increase in the percentage of vertical fractures with increased breakdown pressure .",,American Petroleum Institute

Westbrook(Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. Wichita Kans),,,,,,API-54-212,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"This paper discusses practical aspects of the sand and oil type of fracturing methods which have become prominent during the past year and a half. Fracturing treatments using mixtures of sand and oil have increased in size, which has led to greater increases in production. Large quantities of both refined and crude oils are being used in these procedures. The sand-propping agent is an important feature in fracturing and care in its selection and application can provide greater fracture-flow capacities. A continuous method of blending and proportioning permits variation in sand-oil ratios which facilitates fracturing-treatment completion. Temporary sealing agents have been helpful in producing multiple fractures and in refracturing of wells.INTRODUCTIONIn late 1948, Stanolind Oil and Gas Company announced development of hydraulic-fracturing methods for well treatment for increasing production of oil and gas.1In March 1949 these procedures became commercially available to the oil industry, and have probably done more for improving production from wells than any procedures developed during the past quarter of a century.The basic treatment, called the Hydrafrac? process, is still very much in use; however, a number of variations have been developed. Procedures using refined petroleum products, naturally viscous crude oils, viscous acids, and artificially thickened fluids of several types are offered today under various service names. All of these stemmed from the original methods described some five years ago. They all use a propping agent as part of their composition.The purpose of this paper is to report general progress within that phase of hydraulic fracturing which incorporates the use of sand and oil mixtures. The discussion is confined to the use of refined and crude oils as fracturing fluids, particularly as applied to the Mid-Continent section of the United States.The use of refined oils as fracturing fluids began to gain momentum in the early part of 1952. This trend continued to increase; and, by the latter part of that year, a large proportion of total fracture treatments performed were of this type. The change did not result from ineffectiveness of the hydrocarbon gel-sand method; rather, it was more a matter of economy. Refined oils proved satisfactory as a sandcarrying medium and were relatively cheap, which meant that overall job cost was reduced or that greater volumes of material could be used for the same amount of money. It was also found that some crude oils were satisfactory for fracturing purposes. As a result, large quantities of both crude and refined oils are being used in fracturing treatments today.As in all new developments, the hydraulic fracturing of oil-bearing formations has presented its users with numerous problems. Gradually techniques and methods have been worked out to provide solutions to most of them. Analyzing results of various phases of oil production is often very difficult. This is necessarily so in consideration of the fact that although many wells may have exactly the same treatment, results from them may vary greatly because of various well conditions and unknown factors therein.",,American Petroleum Institute

A total of 549 questionnaires was received. Of this total, 223 questionnaires concerned sand control by the use of unit filters; 133 covered sand consolidation with plastic; and 193 considered control of sand by gravel-packing methods. Attempts to control sand production by artificial methods are classified as an economical and/or mechanical success. An economical success is defined as one where the estimated cost of the sand-control attempt is recovered by the operator from future production. A mechanical success is defined as one where subsequent well production is sand free. The study group defined successful sand-control attempts in this manner in order to provide more definite parameters within which the various sand-control attempts could be classified. A statistical analysis of the data indicates that:Sand control by the use of unit filters has an economic success ratio of 72 percent and a mechanical success ratio of 58 percent.Sand control by consolidating formations with plastlcs has an economical success ratio of 59 percent and a mechanical success ratio of 44 percent.Sand control by gravel-packing methods, considering all methods of gravel-packmg, has an economical success ratio of 81 percent and a mechanical success ratio of 76 percent. Sand control by stage or 'pressure-placement gravel packing has an economical success ratio of 85 percent and a mechanical success ratio of 78 percent.The success ratios indicated on the various meth ods may or may not be indicative of the comparative success that might be expected by the use of one method in preference to another.INTRODUCTIONThe existence of an unconsolidated sand in a producing interval presents a production problem of varying intensity. Under the most severe sanding conditions, reservoirs containing reserves have to be abandoned if measures of sand control are not employed. A less severe sanding condition results in costly operations because of repeated workover operations to place wells back on production after having the well bore plugged with sand. Another aspect of the production difficulties encountered as a result of sand production is the high rate of wear on in-hole and surface equipment resulting from erosion by the sand particles.In March 1952, a committee was formed to study the problems of sand production and to evaluate the attempts made by industry to control sand production. The committee contacted operators with known sand problems in the Southwestern District and requested that they submit on prepared questionnaires, data on the methods, procedures, and results of their attempts to control sand. The committee contacted 94 operating companies and received completed questionnaires from 19. Although the response was not as great as expected, the analysis of the available data suggests that industry is relying increasingly on gravel packing. The use of unit filters and plastic as methods of sand control are now being used less frequently",,American Petroleum Institute

This information may be obtained with varying degrees of success from such subjects as meteorology, oceanography, and soil mechanics. The design engineer should know the answers to many questions involving these sciences before an offshore structure for a particular location can be designed safely and economically One of the most important questions is the magnitude and distribution of the maximum wave forces to which the structure may be subjected during the period of time for which it is to be designed. To answer these questions, it is necessary to know the probable maximum wave height and associated wave length and period, as well as maximum storm tide that could occur during this period. Of comparable importance are the answers to the questions pertaining to the soil characteristics at a given location, because they determine to an appreciable extent the manner in which the structure reacts to the wave-generated forces.

Principal instrumentation employed includes barometers, thermometers, anemometers, psychrometers, ceilometers, radar, sferics devices, radiosonde, rawinsonde, pilot balloon and dropsonde. Instrumentation is sufficiently accurate for observing between surface and 50,000-ft levels.Improvement of observing networks can be achieved largely through increase in the number of observing points, which is almost entirely a financial problem. The Gulf area is sub-standard in meteorological observing facilities. Needed are routine aircraft reconnaissance over the Gulf, at least one year-around weather ship, increase in the coastal land reporting stations, and modern radar installations. Present facilities represent the bare minimum necessary to maintain safety and efficiency of offshore operations, and present indications are that deterioration rather than improvement of governmental facilities is anticipated because of reduction of or no increase in funds at a time of rising costs.Communication of meteorological observations to processing centers involves the preparation of data using internationally agreed-upon codes. All nations participate in the transmission of weather data. Telephone, teletype, telegraph, radio, radioteletype, facsimile, and radiofacsimile are employed to transmit the data around the world within a few hours, or more frequently, a few minutes of the time of observations.Improvements in communication methods have an immediate and vital effect on the efficiency of weather forecasting improvements are being made yearly. During the past month all United States Government weather teletype circuits were converted from 60-speed to 75-speed, thus increasing the possible, volume of traffic 25 percent.Efficiency of weather communications in the western Gulf is now threatened by contemplated termination of the CAA New Orleans Overseas and Foreign Aeronautical Communication Center at the New Orleans Airport for economy reasons. This 20-kilowatt transmitter-receiver station handles, among other traffic, the communication with hurricane reconnaissance aircraft in the western Gulf and the",,American Petroleum Institute
499,321042,,Mobile Unit for Offshore Drilling,John M. Payne(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-54-257,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"INTRODUCTIONInitially, offshore drilling operations were carried on from large self-contained p1atforms with well costs amounting to as much as tenfold that of conventional land drilling. To further complicate matters, the problem of drilling the several exploratory wells which often are required to locate and define the productive area of a single field did not lend itself toward such practices. Although multiple-well platforms afforded some cost reductions, it was soon realized that development of mobility in offshore dri1ling equipment would be desirable in a large majority of cases . This led to the use of small drilling structures complemented by floating drilling tenders which serve as supply boat and crew quarters and hold most of the drilling equipment except derrick, hoist, and possib1e stand-by mud pump. This technique and modifications thereof have been utilized in drilling a large majority of the offshore wells to date.As the next step in reducing costs, completely mobile units offer a number of interesting possibilities. For several years operators, contractors, and designers have recognized the advantage which might be derived from the use of such equipment. However, with the exception of one shallow water unit, little, if any, tangible evidence has been produced. Although the tempo of offshore activity has increased on all fronts since the settlement of the tidelands dispute, the evolution and development in mobile rig designs has been far ahead of advancements in other phases of the problem; and its accelerated pace will, no doubt, continue for some time until more actual offshore experience is gained.Mobile units should require little, if any, fixed structure; should be capable of being moved under average weather conditions; should be rigged up and drilling in a short time; should be unaffected by poor soil conditions; and shou1d be able to withstand reasonable wind and wave forces without jeopardizing or interrupting operations. Although these conditions would appear to be relatively simple, units meeting these qualifications will not be developed overnight and can be produced only after the most careful analysis is made of all the factors involved, using the best technical knowledge available. In many cases, it will be desirable to augment the theoretical work with elaborate tests and special experimental analysis; and even then there is no guarantee of trouble-free operation under actual working conditions.MOBILE-UNIT CHARACTERISTICSIn order to determine the trends and thinking regarding mobile units, a questionnaire was prepared and circulated to 18 oil companies and 10 designers and contractors who are pursuing this problem. All of the operators active in offshore work indicated definite interest in mobile equipment, with many of them making serious plans toward procuring one or more units.Shallow-water UnitsIn the shallow-water range the fixed-leg submersible barge appeared to be the predominant choice. The desirable characteristics regarding this type of unit as indicated by this query are as follows:Operating Depths: 10 ft to 40 ft.Foundation Support: Hull resting on bottom.Classification of Unit: Self-contained type.",,American Petroleum Institute

Konopczynski(WellDynamics International, Ltd.)",,,,,,SPE-77853-MS,"SPE Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition, 8-10 October, Melbourne, Australia",2002,"This paper describes the work process, data management, analysis tools, architecture and capabilities of integrated reservoir management in an intelligent well environment. An example of a &quot;real-time,&quot; web-enabled intelligent-well reservoir management system is provided. The challenges associated with implementing the system are described, and benefits realized from its use are documented.A current hurdle to realizing the economic potential of intelligent wells is the lack of integrated tools and work processes to manage the wealth of production data. The systems described in this paper are designed to overcome this hurdle. The systems are applicable not only to assets employing intelligent wells, but also to conventional assets or those with a mix of intelligent and conventional wells.Technically, an Internet connection transmits &quot;real-time&quot; data from the wellsite to a central host. The latest in industry standards including communication, security, data warehousing, streaming protocols are utilized. Statistical, nodal analysis and predictive modeling techniques are provided and are continually enhanced in the web-environment. These allow the petroleum professional to examine what-if scenarios to quantify the effect of changes in reservoir conditions or well geometry and to recommend optimum settings for enhanced recovery.IntroductionWith the development of cheaper digital technologies, improved, low-cost data communication, and exponential increases in data storage capacity, the number of computational tools and volume of production data available to the petroleum professional continues to grow. Despite the increased information available, well optimization is typically based on an infrequent, rigorous, manual (well review) process. The process relies on significant manual intervention to interpret the data and to develop injection and production philosophies to optimize oil production and reserves recovery.The advent of intelligent wells compounds this problem. Intelligent wells are designed to acquire real-time production data with increased reservoir resolution and to control the movement of fluids in the wellbore at or close to the reservoir interface without mechanical intervention. As a result, the volume of production data available to the petroleum professional from intelligent wells has increased by several orders of magnitude. Also, the capability to reconfigure the well completion to optimize hydrocarbon production and reserves recovery on an ongoing basis has become a reality. Conventional work processes and data management systems are not equipped to handle the volume of data or use it effectively in a timely manner to extract maximum value of the investment in intelligent well technologies.Reservoir Management - A Historical PerspectiveWiggens and Startzman defined petroleum reservoir management as &quot;the application of state-of-the-art technology to a known reservoir system within a given management environment.&quot;1Satter put this in context by stating that the purpose of reservoir management is &quot;to maximize profits from a reservoir by optimizing recovery while minimizing capital investments and operating expenses.&quot;2Prior to the 1980's, reservoir management was based on low-density production data, rudimentary digital reservoir simulation tools, and sequential work processes. The work processes were organized along functional lines with each discipline &quot;handing-off&quot; its contribution to the management process in &quot;assembly line&quot; fashion. Production data, for the most part, was characterized by `snap-shot' well tests - usually generated with a frequency of little more than once per month.",,Society of Petroleum Engineers

Stine(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-54-267,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"INTRODUCTIONThe necessity of reducing the high initial cost and low salvage value inherent with the self-contained method of drilling during the wildcat and early development phase of an offshore drilling program led to the use of a small drilling platform and an auxiliary drilling tender.This method has two separate and distinct components, viz.:A small platform approximately 50 ft by 100 ft in size to support the substructure, derrick, drawworks, engines, rotary, one or more mud pumps, mud pits, electric-logging unit and other miscellaneous equipment necessary for continued operation during short periods of time when the tender is pulled away.The auxiliary drilling tender can be a converted LST or YF barge containing the main mud pumps, mud pits, pipe racks, storage for mud, cement and supplies, mooring equipment, and hotel facilities for approximately 75 men.Floating drilling tenders had been used in the marshes and lakes of the Gulf Coast and in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, for many years; but their requirements were rather simple in comparison to that of a tender supporting an operation in the open waters _of the Gulf of Mexico. Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Inc., was the first company to use this method when they drilled Well No. 1, Block 32, Ship Shoal area, south of Morgan City, Louisiana, with a converted YF' barge in the fall of 1947. This well was completed as the first post-war offshore oil well when it produced at the rate of 40 bbl of oil per hour from perforations 1,734 to 1,750 ft.A drilling tender should be capable of performing the following functions to efficiently support an offshore drilling rig:It must be of sufficient size and design to ride out a tropical storm at anchor, if necessary.It must be designed or converted for the most efficient operation when anchored at a drilling platform, rather than when under way. Inasmuch as the drilling rig normally only operates when the tender is attached to the platform, it should be able to stay in position in all except the most severe wind and wave conditions. To do this, an adequate mooring system must be provided.It should be of sufficient size to provide space for drilling equipment, drill pipe and casing racks, mud and cement storage, and other supplies necessary to drill and complete an oil or gas well.It should provide comfortable quarters and mess and recreation facilities for the drilling and ship's crew to stay aboard for an extended period of time.It should meet all requirements of the United States Coast Guard, American Bureau of Shipping, United States Public Health Service, and other regulatory bodies.",,American Petroleum Institute

Craig(Continental Oil Company),,,,,,API-54-273,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"Active offshore operations began shortly after the end of World War II. U. S. Army and Navy surplus marine equipment of many types and sizes was available. The low price of these boats compared to the cost of building new ones was a temptation to use them for offshore operations.The great majority of the boats were of wood construction. Their sizes ranged from 63 ft to 136 ft. Many of these boats were put into geophysical service and later into drilling and production operation. So far as drilling and production work is concerned, the use of surplus wooden boats is limited. Although they had a low initial cost, they were rather expensive to maintain. All boats are expensive, but the most expensive is the boat that is not operating. Recurrent damage to wooden boats coming in contact with drilling platforms resulted in considerable loss of time and expense.After the expensive experience with surplus wooden hulls, it became evident that the most efficient and economical approach was building new equipment designed for the specific job, even though the initial cost was high.From experience the minimum equipment required to transport crews to one drilling operation, whether the well is being drilled from a large self-contained platform or a small platform with a drilling-barge tender, should be two crew boats and a standby boat. The standby boat is left at the drilling site for emergency use. The other two boats are used to transport crews to and from location, and occasionally may be used to transport emergency supplies and small fishing tools.Crew boats should be able to carry 25 to 30 passengers in reasonable comfort. Most boats today are using the bus-type reclining seats. No meals are served, but there is usually a pot of coffee available. Some wells are located as far as 56 miles from their operating base , which means a 4- or 5-hour boat ride. If a boat is lost in a fog and wanders out of the narrow channels onto a mud flat, it may mean 10 hours or more.Standby boats are for the security of the crews while working on offshore wells. It is desired to have these boats staunch and capable of coming alongside a platform to remove crews and they should be able to ride out a hurricane to a safe base. A boat of this type should be able to carry 30 or more passengers. Along with these three boats it is necessary to have a supply or cargo boat capable of supplying a drilling well with casing, mud, water, cement, and fuel. Early methods of transporting and handling supplies was by trial and error. The most acceptable method was the use of cargo barges and tugs.In order to handle a cargo barge under adverse weather conditions and maneuver it into position to unload cargo, it is necessary to use capable tugs with 500 hp or more.",,American Petroleum Institute

Pedersen(The California Company),,,,,,API-54-277,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"Drilling equipment and techniques in Gulf Coast offshore operations are in many ways similar to those encountered in inshore Gulf Coast operations. However, the exacting requirements of drilling from multi-well platforms pose several new problems and exaggerate many of the inshore drilling problems.The mention of multi-well platforms immediately classifies this paper in the development-drilling category. Inasmuch as a development-drilling program is the goal of the companies entering into offshore drilling operations, this classification seems logical. Actually, wildcat drilling operations do not differ greatly from development-drilling operations offshore. This holds true in an offshore wildcat area because if the first well which is normally a straight hole is dry, then additional drilling tests to the objective are usually made before abandoning the platform. Directional drilling is then required to reach the new targets. Similarly, the first well from a development platform is usually a straight hole and the additional wells are directional holes (Fig. 1). Multiple-well platforms in offshore operations have the advantage of lower per-well construction costs, plus the long-range advantage of lower operating and maintenance costs of such platforms when the wells are in the producing stage. Offsetting these economies are the additional cost and areal-reach limitations of directional drilling. Six-well platforms have been selected in some areas as a compromise between these offsetting factors. In areas of multiple producing zones, platforms for as many as 12 wells have proved satisfactory.An important consideration in offshore development drilling is the proper location of subsequent drilling platforms. The location is often dependent upon geological control obtained from wells drilled from the last completed platform. This situation is complicated by the fact that erection of a 6-well, 1-rig platform requires 4 months from the time the location is selected to the time the p1atform is ready for spudding the first well. If the average time to drill wells is only 1 month, then location of the next platform must be determined from geological information obtained from the first 2 wells drilled from a new platform. This requires careful selection of bottom-hole locations by the geologists, and the drilling departments are expected to be able to reach these targets. This challenge has been met by improved directional-drilling techniques.The equipment used in offshore drilling operations must be the best available to insure an absolute minimum of costly shut down time. In the early stages of offshore drilling, the drilling rig cannot be tailored to the specific drilling task and often the - rig in use will have sufficient capacity for drilling to twice the objective depth. Because many of the offshore prospects are piercement-type salt-dome structures, or deep-seated salt-dome structures with multiple-zone objectives, the objective depths in a particular area may vary from 3,000 ft to 16,000 ft. It is neither practical nor economical to design offshore drilling platforms to accommodate several",,American Petroleum Institute

Ault(Magnolia Petroleum Company Morgan City La),,,,,,API-54-282,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"An offshore drilling operation which is terminated with an oil-producing well immediately presents crude-oil handling and transporting problems. Seven operators at the present time are actively engaged in the production of crude oil from offshore sites; and, therefore, they have come to grips with the problems. Other operators venturing offshore also will have to solve the problems. However, they will have the benefit of the experience of the pioneers. One operator may use several handling and transporting methods depending upon the location of his various ho1dings. Depth of water, distance from land, prevailing weather, proximity to pipelines, rate of production, size of reserves, relative location of fields, and value of crude are factors which determine offshore handling and transporting methods. Each operator in each producing area has a unique operation; and, therefore, it is believed that a cost study of offshore methods would be of questionable value.There are offshore, inshore, and land drilling and producing activities along the Louisiana and Texas coast of the Gulf of Mexico. An offshore symposium, naturally, should concern Itself only with actual offshore operations. However, certain offshore operations are really more typical of inshore operations. Taking the presently producing offshore oil fields as they occur from east to west, we start with blain Pass Block 69 Field which is located approximately 3 miles northeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Although the field is located in water having an average depth of 20 ft, the proximity to and the protection provided by the Delta reduces the operation to one which is more typically inshore than offshore . Flow lines from the land-side wells are brought to a tank battery on shore where the produced oil, gas, and water are separated. Pipeline oil is barged from the tank battery to a refinery. Production from the outside wells is separated at offshore p1atforms, and the oil is pumped ashore through a pipeline to a tank battery. Barges are used to transport the oil from the tank battery to a refinery.Grand Isle Block 18 Field is the next westerly field, and it is located approximately 6 1/2 miles offshore in an average water depth of 50 ft. There are two producing platforms in this field, and they are connected by a common flow line. Production is separated, and oil is stored in a tank battery on one of the platforms, from which it is barged to a tank battery on land. Pipe1in e oil is transported by barges from the land tank battery to a refinery. Grand Isle Block 16 Field is located 4 1/2 miles offshore in 40 ft of water. Production at the lone platform in this field is handled and transported in the same manner as that in the Block 18 Field. Bay Marchand Block 2 Field is the next fie1d west, and it is located 3 miles offshore in 30 ft of water. Production is separated at offshore platforms, and the oil is pumped through a pipeline to a tank battery on shore. The shore tank battery has a pipeline connection.",,American Petroleum Institute

Reardon(The Pure Oil Company),,,,,,API-54-284,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1954,"The production of natural-gas-condensate wells located in the Gulf of Mexico in a safe, efficient, and commercial manner presents several problems not normally encountered on land. The transportation of the gas and condensate to shore, the type and size of the dehydration and separation equipment to be used, the location of the separator platform, and the maintenance of the production equipment are just a few of the considerations which demand attention.In view of the fact that the wells drilled in the Gulf cost four to six times the amount they would normally cost on land and that the cost of constructing a transmission pipeline in the Gulf is substantially more than constructing a transmission line on land, a reservoir of adequate reserves must be found in order to support such Investments.Fig. 1 illustrates a typical down-the-hole completion which has been found suitable for offshore operations. The sands in which the wells are completed are selectively perforated with sufficient perforation density to insure minimum sand-face pressure differentials at the anticipated rates of flow. On the bottom of the tubing string is a 3.5-in. OD gas anchor. The gas anchor is approximately 30 ft long with 20 ft of 0.030-in. gage horizontal slots of 1/2-in. longitudinal spacings. All of the slots in the gas anchor were undercut in order to restrict the flow of sand into the tubing string. The total area of the slotting is 11.1 times greater than the cross-sectional area of the 3.5-in. OD tubing. A bull plug with a 3/4-in. hole drilled in the bottom is welded on the bottom of the gas anchor. Just above the bull plug, a cross support is welded inside of the gas anchor. This cross support is used as a bottom for resting the bottom-hole pressure bomb when pressure surveys are being taken.The production packer is normally set 30 to 60 ft above the perforations in order to keep the gas anchor out of the perforations.A tubing string of 3.5-in. OD N-80 tubing with special couplings has proved satisfactory. The special couplings were used to help prevent joint leakage and give a more streamlined flow of the fluid passing through the tubing. Having a more streamlined Bow of the Auld reduces the turbulence which normally causes corrosion and erosion. The 3.5-in. OD tubing was selected in order to minimize the - pressure loss caused by friction and also the linear velocities of the fluid flowing through the tubing. On flow tests, wells have been flowed at rates up to 20.5 MMcf per day, and maximum linear velocities of 20 to 25 ft per sec were obtained in the production string when using 3.5-in. OD tubing. The tubing string may be internally coated with a baked plastic coating to prevent corrosion of the tubing. Landing nipples are installed for safety purposes.",,American Petroleum Institute

Although satisfactory solutions to all of the safety problems offshore have not yet been found, a great deal of progress has been made through the development of new safety equipment and safety precautions.In the construction of any offshore installation, one of the primary factors which has controlled the design and arrangement has been the concern for the safety of the operating personnel. Many things, of course, influence the orientation and arrangement of an offshore platform, but it is obvious to me from a study of most of the offshore installations that a major factor of concern has been that of isolating the crew living quarters from the portion of the platform which might be considered a hazard area. In a number of the offshore-platform installations, a very rigorous study was made of the day-to-day weather conditions at the location of the platform, with the wind direction being of prime interest. When it became necessary to build living quarters for production personnel, in almost all cases the prevailing wind direction became the most important factor in locating the quarters installation. Many of the offshore operators have deemed it wise to build a separate quarters platform upwind of the hazard area, which is considered to be the wellhead and separation area, and joining the main drilling structure and quarters platform by one or more walkways. In one installation with which I am very familiar, the operator has constructed a separate living-quarters and utility approximately 250 ft upwind of the wellhead area. Located on this platform is all of the equipment which might be considered a source of ignition, such as generator and air-compressor units, radio equipment, cooking stove, hot-water heater, general living-quarter appliances, etc. In this particular installation the operator has constructed walkways joining both ends of the main drilling structure with the living-quarter-utility platform in such a manner that it would be impossible, in the event of an accident in the hazard area, for the operating personnel to become trapped on the main drilling structure. This walkway arrangement also affords an approach to the hazard area from either direction. For personnel safety on almost all offshore-platform installations, the operators have lined all platforms and walkways with heavy p a r d rails or chainlink fences. Most platforms in the Gulf of Mexico are equipped with what are called escape ramps and Jacob's ladders to afford the operating personnel a mews of getting clear of the platform if an emergency makes it necessary for them to abandon the platform.",,American Petroleum Institute

These are expected to double in the next 25 years and that will require the discovery of many new petroleum provinces if the industry, as it is now known, is to be maintained. Many variable factors control the discovery of new provinces. Provinces are found only by drilling wells, and drilling enough wells to find provinces requires a favorable political and economic climate. There is often but slight enthusiasm for the wildcat well that opens up a new province and many are a surprise to most orthodox exploration opinion. The normal sequence of exploration is to drill the structural traps first, then the combination structural and stratigraphic traps, and finally the purely stratigraphic type. Each phase discovers new provinces and sub-provinces. The importance of unconformities in petroleum exploration cannot be over-emphasized and they account for the delayed discovery of many deeper sub-provinces. Examples of some possible future petroleum provinces in the United States and Canada are given. Geological evidence points to many more provinces yet to be discovered in the United States and Canada-provided the incentives to drill the necessary wells to find them are maintained.When the oil of the future is discussed, in effect the future of the oil industry in the United States is being discussed. Several surveys have arrived at the same conclusion-that if present trends are projected, we will be consuming twice as much oil 25 years from now as we do today-the equivalent of an East Texas oil pool will be burned up every year! The question is: Do we have it? The oil in sight today in the United States will not begin to meet the needs of 1975-1980 unless, that is, we turn to atomic power or to imports as our chief energy source. There is nothing new in this situation, as we have never had in sight more than a relatively few years' oil supply, and we have traditionally depended up o n discoveries of new pools to meet our needs. But we are now faced with needs far greater than anything heretofore visualized; and both the industry and the nation should continually examine its future prospects in terms of its needs-we should keep 1ooking at our hole card -lest we wake up some morning with new laws and national policies that are based on lack of thought and on misinformation.My views on our future undiscovered oil provinces are merely my own-they do not necessarily reflect the views of the geological profession or even of many members of it.

Experience has shown that one method of providing added lateral stability for flat-hulled mobile units which drill in areas having extremely soft bottoms is in the provision of extended skirts attached to the barge hull and designed to extend below the mud bottom. Allied problems experienced with mobile drilling units, such as methods used to safely and quickly abandon a well, and methods used to support the blowout preventers independent of the unit are reviewed. The design of well-protector jackets to withstand continuous cyclic wave loading when founded in extremely soft soil and the problems of wellhead support and methods used to solve these problems are also reviewed.INTRODUCTIONAs of February 1, 1955 there were five mobile drilling units actively engaged in drilling offshore in water depths from 20 to 40 ft. They were: Kermac 40, Kermac 44, Delong-McDermott, Mr. Charlie, and the S-44. Probably the best-known unit of the five listed , and the one to which all the others excepting the Delong-McDermott unit are basically similar, is the Kermac 40 which was originally the Barnsdall-Hayward unit. This unit has been in service since 1949 and has successfully drilled a large number of wells. Essentially this unit consists of two upper decks, machinery and operations decks, mounted on steel columns the base of which are attached to a 160-ft by 54-ft by 13-ft submersible hull. Two 100-ft by 14-ft by l2-f t pontoons are mounted outrigger fashion on either side of the hull. The operations and machinery decks house the drilling and auxiliary equipment, crew quarters, dry and active mud storage, and equipment storage. The hull contains 17 separate ballast and storage compartments and a pump room. Ballast and transfer pumps are located in the pump room, as the machinery deck is over 32 ft above the hull bottom. Sinking the unit on location is accomplished by flooding and sinking the slot end of the barge to bottom; and, after obtaining a firm reaction from bottom. the stern end of the unit is sunk to bottom. The pontoons furnish the necessary stability until the hull reaches bott6m. The pontoons are then flooded and jacked down to bottom.",,American Petroleum Institute

To date the permanent-type well-completion technique, utilizing through-the-tubing tools run on a small wire line, has been used to complete and recomplete dual and single wells on land and water locations at substantial cost savings. Techniques and equipment have been developed that permit logging, cementing, perforating, removing sand and set cement, production stimulating, and the exclusion of sand below the tubing without removing the tubing ; and these techniques have been used to depths greater than 11,500 ft. Equipment is now being field-tested which unifies all services and equipment to bring about a reduction of surface equipment, manpower, and time necessary to perform well recompletions by the permanent- type method.INTRODUCTIONA complete workover was performed on a well without the use of a rig in the spring of 1952. An important forerunner of this operation was the development of a perforator small enough to pass through the tubing. The successful field use of this new concept of testing and reworking wells indicated the possibility of a sizable reduction in costs and a more extensive testing of all producing intervals penetrated by the well bore.The higher production rates obtained with the tubing-type perforator when perforating with salt water as a completion fluid have led to extensive laboratory study of the plugging effects of completion fluids, perforators, and techniques. ?The preliminary report of some of this testing was issued in October 1953 by T. O. Allen and J. H. Atterbury, Jr.Continued testing has revealed the severe perforation plugging caused Ly faulty jet-charge design, completion techniques, and completion fluids.Extensive testing of cements and cementing techniques with sandstone cores has given an insight into the role of filtration during the act of squeeze cementing. New cements were tested and old cements were reviewed with attention on the filtration rate as the most important characteristic. New methods of field-mixing small batches of cement with smaller cement trucks were cited by the authors as a needed development in October 1953. An improved method of mixing is being used and smaller cementing trucks are now being introduced. As successful low-pressure squeeze-cementing jobs continue to increase, a trend to reduced cement volumes and surface squeeze pressures is evident.With the advent of the permanent-type well-completion method and solution of the problems confronting this type of operation, it became apparent that the use of small through-the-tubing type tools would permit a cost reduction and still allow better well control.Over a dozen abnormal-pressure wells have now been recompleted without killing the well with mud. For simplicity, abnormal-pressure wells may be defined as wells having surface pressure when filled with salt water. These wells are being reworked with greater safety and at greatly reduced costs.",,American Petroleum Institute

Also, lower pump rates can be utilized to carry the sand deeper into the fracture because the bulk of the fluid remains in the fracture to carry the sand. All field tests of this material to date have been successful, with the additive and lease crude mixed at the well site. Tests have been conducted in Oklahoma, Wyoming, Kansas, and West Texas with encouraging results. Treatments and results are discussed herein.INTRODUCTIONThe study of fracturing fundamentals by Continental Oil Company's research laboratories has resulted in the development of an additive which converts lease crude into a superior fracturing fluid. This material, Adomite, a complex mixture of sulfonates, is effective in reducing the fluid loss of most lease crudes to less than 10 cc when used in concentrations of 0.1 lb per gal of oil, but has little effect on the fluid's viscosity.Use of the additive with lease crude as a fracturing fluid has resulted in greater increases in production From fractures than is obtained with ordinary fracturing fluids. These increases in production apparently result from longer fractures which are created by the low-fluid-loss fracturing fluid. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that fluid-loss characteristics of fracturing oils are more important in fracture extension than are any of the other physical properties, such as viscosity, gravity, and sand-carrying ability. Adequate discussion of the breakdown fluid has been presented elsewhere,1,2,3,4and this presentation is concerned only with the extension of the fracture. Regardless of whether vertical or horizontal fractures are created by proper selection of breakdown fluid, either type of fracture can be extended most effectively by the use of a low-fluid-loss material.Since the inception of hydraulic fracturing for increasing oil production, the oil industry constantly has been seeking improved fracturing fluids. Originally, fluids having high gel strengths were used, because this property was believed necessary in order to carry sand from the well bore into the fracture. The next development was the use of refinery residuals which had high viscosities and moderate fluid-loss properties. This change came about because these oils were cheaper, and, as reported in the literature by Clark et al.5proved more effective.Refinery residuals have been used quite successfully for fracturing fluids for the last few years. However, they have some disadvantages as listed following.High fluid loss limits the amount of down-hole work residuals can do in extending the fracture because the fluid-loss rate into the matrix rock approaches the pump rate.High viscosity makes them difficult to pump and limits the rate at which they can be hand1ed through tubing.",,American Petroleum Institute

Wilsey(Stanolind Oil and Gas Co.),,,,,,API-55-117,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"A new method of analyzing producing rate and pressure-buildup data is presented which permits direct measurement of the cause of low well productivity. When the cause of the low well productivity is known, it is possible to determine if stimulation is needed and the results to be expected from these treatments. The method of analysis presented uses only data collected during the first few hours after shut-in. This makes the method practical, because a minimum loss of current income results while the well is shut in to collect the necessary data. Use of this method will increase the percentage of successful fracture treatments by eliminating treatment of wells in which there is little chance of increasing production significantly. Examples of the application of this method to the solution of actual well problems are given.INTRODUCTIONThe development of hydrau1ic fracturing as a method of well stimulation has resulted in completion of many wells which otherwise would not be commercial. Also many wells which were a1most ready .to be abandoned have been rejuvenated and made profitable as a result of fracture treatment. Despite many successes, all fracture treatments are not profitable. Why some treatments are successful and others are not is not always clear. Making a productivity-stimulation treatment profitable can be divided into two phases:1, Determine the reasons for unsatisfactory productivity; and 2, design and perform the required treatment. This paper deals with the first phase. It presents a method for determining reasons for unsatisfactory productivity and for predicting the results to be expected from stimulation treatment.Low productivity in a well may be the result of any one or a combination of the following causes.A severe permeability reduction may exist near the well bore. Because all fluids must flow through the formations adjacent to the well bore, a reduction in permeability here can result in a non-commercial well even though considerable recoverable oil still remains in a permeable reservoir. By removing this permeability block, a large increase in productivity will result. The spectacular results of wash treatments, relatively small-volume fracture treatments, and other similar treatments which affect only the reservoir rock near the well bore, result from removing this permeability block.There may be substantial recoverable oil in place but the formation permeability is so low that it cannot be recovered at economic rates by conventional completion methods. Large increases in recovery from reservoirs of this kind can be obtained by deeply penetrating fractures, as suggested by Wilsey and Bearden.1Treatments of this kind are expensive and are not needed in more permeable formations.Reservoir pressure has been depleted even in the inter-well area, i.e., there is insufficient reservoir energy remaining to expel more oil. In this situation, present productivity-stimulation techniques will not result in sufficient sustained increased productivity to be profitable.",,American Petroleum Institute

Greenberger,,,,,,API-55-130,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Four correlation problems are discussed, ranging in complexity from a simple two-dimensional problem involving porosity and permeability to a complex' 10-variable study of factors affecting the prediction of oil recovery by water drive from basic reservoir parameters. It is shown that in the simpler problems, the least-squares regression method results in correlation comparable to the common graphical methods using a straightedge or curve. For problems involving numerous variables, the numerical method, when combined with the use of an automatic punched-card computing machine, becomes a useful tool for analyzing the more complex problems encountered by the petroleum engineer.INTRODUCTIONMost engineers have plotted data on graph paper, and with a straightedge or a curve, have drawn average lines through the points. These lines or curves are then used to represent average conditions and as references for making estimates when complete data are not available. This is a correlation analysis in its simplest form. It is the purpose of this paper to present results obtained by using a correlation technique whereby problems involving considerable data, and many variables may be successfully handled mathematically in a fairly simple manner. Details of the method will not be discussed, as they may be readily obtained1,2Straight-line CorrelationA straight-line correlation is a linear, two-dimensional .correlation of two variables. An example is the simple straight line of Fig. 1. In this problem it was desired to determine, an average relation between porosity and permeability, so that porosities could be estimated for samples from which only permeability measurements were available.In ordinary engineering work, a line drawn with a straightedge through the points would suffice. However, in work involving participation in a unitization effort, a completely unbiased method is desirable. The position of the line in Fig. 1 was determined by the method of least squares, which results in the formula for the straight line (Formula is available in full paper)The sum of the squares, of the vertical distances from a line determined by this method. to each data Point is less than .a similar sum obtained for. any other possible line .

Fig. 2 illustrates such a case. Here it was desired to determine the average relation between formation depth and the liquid content of reservoir gases. It was found that a slightly curved line could be made to fit the data points better than a straight line. The method of least squares was again used to obtain the equation of the average curved line.",,American Petroleum Institute

Included are essential data on reservoir characteristics, history of development, and reservoir performance under both competitive and unitized gas- and water-injection operations. Factors resulting in successive changes in unit operations from selective production, to gas injection and selective production, to water injection, gas injection, and selective production, are reviewed. It is concluded that unitized pressure-maintenance operation will result in recovery of approximately twice the ultimate volume of oil that would have been recovered from the unit area by competitive pressure-depletion operation.INTRODUCTIONThe initial 67-well Southwest Antioch Gibson Sand Unit area was produced as a solution gas-drive- pool for 2 1/2 years prior to the beginning of gas-injection operations. The initial unit was formed April 1, 1948,and has since been enlarged to include a tota1 of 238 wells. Pressure maintenance was effected by se1ective production and gas-injection operations from the date of unitization until March, 1952, when water injection was initiated. Subsequent to this date, pressure-maintenance operations have included selective production, gas injection, and water injection.History of DevelopmentThe Southwest Antioch Gibson Sand Unit, the Northeast Elmore Third Deese Sand Unit, the Katie, the Southeast Newhope, and the Southwest Maysville Fields constitute one common source of supply known as the Golden Trend Third Deese sand producing area. This reservoir underlies an area approximately 21 miles 1ong and 3 miles wide, and contains over 800 producing Third Deese sand wells. Fig. 1 is an outline map showing the location of the Unit with respect to the Golden Trend area.The Southwest Antioch Gibson Sand Unit is located in Township 3 North, Ranges 2 and 3 West, Garvin County, Oklahoma. This unit area is 52 miles south of Oklahoma City and 13 miles west of Pauls Valley, Oklahoma. Geologically, the Southwest Antioch(Fig 1 and 2 are available in full paper) Gibson Sand Unit is located near the center of a northwest-southeast trending stratigraphic trap on the southwestern flank of the Pauls Valley uplift. The dip of the Pennsylvanian formations westward into the Anadarko Basin is 150 to 400 ft per mile, and the reservoir sand gades basinward into shales and impermeable silt. Gibson sand is the name used locally in referring to the productive section of the Third Deese sand of Pennsylvanian age. The Hart sand, found 50 to 75 ft below the Gibson sand in this area, contains gas distillate and oil, and is productive in some locations under the northwest portion of the present unit. Fig. 2 is a structure map of the unit area with contours drawn on the subsea tops of the Gibson sand.Gibson sand production in this area was first discovered by the Globe Oil and Refining Company and Vickers Petroleum Company No.1",,American Petroleum Institute

The study committee was formed in 1954 just prior to the 1954 meeting of the Mid-Continent District of the Division of Production, held in Oklahoma City. Considerable interest in the subject had been voiced at the meetings in 1952 and 1953; and, as a result, the study committee was activated under the District Committee- on Drilling Practice. A complete committee roster is included in an appendix as Exhibit A.A questionnaire was and reviewed at the first meeting of the committee. It was later revised and sent to all members of the committee to be completed and returned to the chairman. Some of the members reported .for their companies by districts on separate questionnaires, which resulted in a total of 50 rep1ies received from 38 companies. A sample of the revised questionnaire is included in the appendix as Exhibit B.The report presents a summary of the replies to the questionnaire, and the most significant data is presented in Table 1. As was originally intended, no reference is made to any particu1ar company. Rather, the summary refers to a code number which was assigned to each reply. The objective of the committee was one of fact-finding only, and no recommendations are made concerning the use of any particular design factors.In addition to the data presented in Table 1, a collective statement covering most of the other questions is included under each general heading in the body of the paper. Throughout the questionnaire and the paper, reference i s made to design factors rather than safety factors, a practice which has been suggested by Saye and Richardson1Design Factors UsedThe design factors currently in use are listed in Table 1. In addition to reporting on what design factors were currently being applied, all companies, with two exceptions, replied that API minimum performance properties were being used as a basis for the design. One of these companies indicated that average values were being used with the factors as reported. It will be noted that, in designing for collapse, a design factor of 1.0 used with the average performance property is equivalent to a factor of 0.75 used with the minimum performance property.2The other operator reported that the API minimum tensile property for Grade J-55 material was not recognized.",,American Petroleum Institute

Later it has been shown that drilling of such holes is not possible4and all holes are actually inclined even in homogeneous formations. Therefore, many of the conclusions of the early studies are not valid. In the 1ater theoretical investigation4,5the assumption of hole verticality has been removed and the effects of collar and hole size in the control of crooked holes have been studied. In , the present investigation the effect of stabilizers in the drill-collar string is studied.In the past, use of stabilizers has sometimes been successful6,7,8,9and sometimes disappointing. The problem is so complex that it seems impossible from field experience to establish rules for the successful use of stabilizers. For this reason, a theoretical investigation was conducted jointly by the research departments of Hughes Tool Company and Stanolind Oil and Gas Company. The numerical work involved solving 1engthy equations which necessitated a digital computer. The IBM Programmed Electronic Calculator at the Stanolind Research Center was used.In this study the effects of rotation are disregarded. The justification for this is that the same assumption made in the past4,5led to results in agreement with field experience.6,10Progress reports on this investigation were presented at meetings of the API Mid-Continent and Southwestern District Study Conamittees on Straighthole Drilling.General Effect of a StabilizerConsider a drilling string in an inclined hole, as shown in Fig. 1A. In the vicinity of the bit, the string does not contact the wall of the hole. At some distance above the bit, the drilling string contacts the wall. Above the point of contact the string lies on the low side of the hole.With no weight on the bit, the only force acting on the bit is the result of the weight of the portion of the string between the bit and the point of contact. This is a beneficial force because it tends to bring the hole toward vertical. When weight is applied, there is another force which is detrimental because it tends to direct the hole away from vertical.",,American Petroleum Institute

Methods are cited whereby mathematical functions are substituted for table-lookup, and arithmetical operations are performed automatically after the introduction of strictly basic measurements. These mathematical formulas develop results almost instantaneously and obviate the use of voluminous numerical tables heretofore used to determine volumes in storage tanks and corrections due to thermal expansion or contraction or the oil. The determination of vo1umes and gravities of crude oil and its products is a problem which is found universally in oil production, refining, and marketing.A problem which is found universally in oil production, refining, and marketing is the determination of volumes and gravities of crude oil and its products. In production and pipeline operations, such measurements are reflected on run tickets which constitute the fundamental supporting documents for oil production, runs, sales, royalties, and taxes.Until 1954 methods of measurement, tables, and means of calculation which oil production and pipeline men used to determine crude-oil runs appeared to be firmly entrenched in inflexible procedure. But at the present time, industry is making important developments in modernizing procedure. Perhaps the most significant advancement leading to modernization of procedures has been the joint preparation by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and the British Institute of Petroleum (IP) of universally approved tab1es of coefficients for volumetric correction for thermal expansion. Industry- wide use of the new ASTM-IP tables1became effective January 1, 1954, after approval by standardizing organizations here and abroad, including the American Petroleum Institute, the California Natural Gasoline Association, the National Bureau of Standards, the National Lubricating Grease Institute, the Synthetic Rubber Division of the United States Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the U.S. Bureau of Mines, the British Air Ministry, the British Customs and Excise Office, the British Ministry of Fuels and Power, the British Ministry of Supply, and the British War Office. This work was followed by the issuance ofAPI Std 2500: Measuring, Sarnpling, and Testing of Crude Oil, which became effective January 1, 1955. These prominent steps in standardization of tables and measurements coupled with new developments in automatic gaging and electronic calculating techniques, have infused new interest in run-calculating procedures. These developments logically aim toward further improvement- ultimately to a fully automatic procedure for this phase of petroleum-industry data processing.In a fully automatic calculating procedure, table lookup has been (until recently) the stumbling block because of the necessity to use three types of tables:1, tank tables (a separate volumetric table for each tank);2, API gravity correction table (ASTM-IP Table 5); and3, volume correction table (ASTM-IP Table 7). lank tables give space volumes for various Levels in &frac14;-in. increments, and an individual tank table has to be prepared for each tank.

Although no attempt is made to supply a universally applicable answer to this problem, this paper reviews and evaluates the economics of a major equipment modernization program recently completed by Shell Oil Company involving 464 stripper wells in Southern Oklahoma. This project involved replacement of 20- to 40-year old rod-line central powers or rig fronts with electric motor-driven unit pumpers. Statistical results from a study of the Healdton Field show that modernization of 249 wells increased production 10.4 percent although the number of operating wells was decreased 27 percent. At the same time it became possible to reduce operating costs 45.6 percent through the use of efficient modern equipment. On the basis of the Healdton Field study, an undeferred net profit of $3,177,000 or 353 percent on the investment of $900,000 for modernization of 464 wells is indicated from possible operating-cost savings alone over the life of the properties. Although the data presented in this paper were obtained from studies of certain specific fields, the results demonstrate the considerable benefits which generally accrue from modernization and, therefore, may be helpful to others considering similar projects.INTRODUCTIONThroughout much of its history the oil industry has relied on the slow steady production of stripper wells to meet a large part of the demand for petroleum. A recent count by the Interstate Oil Compact Commission showed that 7 out of every 10 oil wells in the United States are now in the stripper stage of production. A stripper well is defined as one producing at its maximum rate and operating on a very narrow margin of profit. Many of these wells are produced with obsolete worn-out equipment which has high operating cost and low production efficiency. Where production equipment is in such poor condition, the operator suffers loss of production, reduced net profit, and probable reduced ultimate production. Inefficient operation does not-promote conservation.The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate a million-dollar modernization program recently completed by the Shell Oil Company, involving the replacement of 20- to 40-year old production equipment on 464 stripper wells in southern Oklahoma. Although the data presented were obtained from these specific properties, they may be useful to others considering similar modernization projects. The writer, however, does not wish to give the impression that equipment modernization is a panacea to be applied to all stripper production. Production rate, reserves, life, operating cost, condition of old equipment, and replacement costs all should be carefully analyzed before undertaking major expenditures for equipment modernization.CONDITIONS LEADING TO EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTA great portion of the major production equipment on Shell Oil Company's older southern Oklahoma properties had been installed when the wells were originally completed and was from 20 to 40 years old.",,American Petroleum Institute

All of the information presented is discussed in a qualitative or relative manner , inasmuch as most of the latest quantitative information has been published in previous papersINTRODUCTIONThe rapidly expanding interest in the use of mobile units to drill offshore wells has resulted in the development of engineering methods which can be used to evaluate the relative capabilities of various designs. Although there is still a considerable difference of opinion between offshore designers as to what constitutes reasonable design criteria, the methods outlined in this paper can be used quite effectively to compare one unit with another by using any consistent set of criteria. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application of these methods in a qualitative manner, inasmuch as most of the detai1ed quantitative information which is available today has been presented previously.1,2Although the quantitative material is still in a semi-theoretical stage, more information is becoming available which will alleviate this situation. A number of companies are engaged in full-scale field research projects which are aimed at estimating wave forces more accurately, and some companies are keeping detailed records on the behavior of their equipment under various conditions.In order to compare the general design characteristics of different units, a general classification of mobile units is presented. The marine characteristics, wind forces, wave forces, and foundation characteristics of mobile units are discussed.Classification of Mobile UnitsOne genera1 classification of offshore mobile units is difficult because there are so many possible combinations. However most units will fall into three classes, depending upon their method of installation, and three others based upon their method of support. This general method of classification is illustrated in Fig-. 1. The three classes, based upon the method of installation, are as follows:Fixed-deck UnitsThese units , as the name implies, maintain a fixed relationship between the drilling deck and floating support hull, and they are placed on location by sinking the hull to bottom. Because the floating stability is lost when the hull is submerged horizontally, it is necessary to utilize some type of auxiliary members such as movable pontoons, hull extensions, or movable bearing feet; or the unit could also be submerged one end first. Inherently this design is limited as to maximum depth because of the excessive elevations of the drilling deck when the unit is floating.",,American Petroleum Institute

Taylor(Shell Oil Co.),,,,,,API-55-222,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"During the past 3 years several wells have been drilled which have had shut-in surface pressures close to or exceeding 10,000 psi. In view of the evident need by the industry for Christmas trees in the 15,000-psi working-pressure class, and as the API design criteria for a flange connection in this pressure class are inadequate, the Flex-Float Engineering Company, the Gray Tool Company, the McEvoy Company, Cameron Iron Works, and the Association of Wellhead Equipment Manufacturers proceeded to develop end connections for Christmas-tree components which were suitable for extreme pressures. The use of pressure-energized seals enabled the designers to use API flanges of a lower working pressure for the 15,000-psi working-pressure class connection, or permitted the use of a form of connection different from the API flange such as the split-ring clamp. With the exception of the connection developed by the Association of Wellhead Equipment Manufacturers, the joints are patented. As standardization of a patented connection cannot be effected, and as standardization of any generally accepted connection is desirable, the industry as a whole should be , considering ways and means of obtaining standardization of end connections in the 15,000-psi working pressure class.INTRODUCTIONIn 1952 a well was completed in Louisiana which had a shut-in surface pressure that exceeded 10,000 psi. The effect of this pressure on the Christmas-tree connections and down-hole equipment necessitated-plugging of the well. Subsequently, several other wells were drilled on the Gulf Coast having shut-in pressures close to or exceeding 10,000 psi. At the time of this writing, a well has been drilled in Louisiana which is reported to have wellhead flowing pressure of 12,500 psi. All of this lends emphasis to the fact that wellhead equipment having working pressures in excess of 10,000 psi is needed by the industry.As a result of an inquiry from the producing company which drilled the original well having a shut-in pressure greater than 10,000psi to various manufacturers concerning the development of an end connection for wellhead and Christmas-tree components that would be suitable for 15,000-psi working pressure, the Association of Wellhead Equipment Manufacturers and some manufacturers, acting independently, initiated development work along this line. Entirely new concepts for seals and connections in this pressure class were required, inasmuch as the API design criteria for a flange connection were inadequate and impracticable. One of the manufacturers computed that a single API flange having a bore of 6 1/8 in. would have an outside diameter of 42 in., a thickness of 15 9/16, in., and would weigh 5,940 lb. Mating flanges would require 20 bolts having a diameter of 2 3/4, in.

Trimble(Magnolia Petroleum Company),,,,,,API-55-235,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"The newly developed inverted (water-in-oil) emulsion mud, first tested in October 1953, had seen use in over 75 wells by January 1955, as a drilling in or completion mud. This mud, prepared by mixing equal vo1umes of oil and water-base mud in the presence of specia1 emulsifiers, has provided improved early production rates in the Purdy Field, Garvin County, Oklahoma, and in the Jameson-Strawn Field, Coke County, West Texas. Although findings are not conclusive, it appears that somewhat lower drilling rates prevail with the inverted emulsion mud than with water-base muds. The use of conventional resistivity and self-potential logs in this mud is not possible because of its very high resistivity; but neutron, gamma ray, and induction logs are greatly improved because of the uniform hole diameter.INTRODUCTIONA considerable variety of oil-base f1uids have been utilized as rotary drilling muds. These fluids may be described, broadly, as consisting of a hydrocarbon oil, either crude or refined, which may contain dispersed organic or inorganic solids and dispersed droplets of immiscible liquids. In all cases, oil would be the external phase; and other components, unless soluble in the oil, would be dispersed in the oil as discontinuous phases.Oil-base drilling fluids are used, in the simplest sense, as a means of avoiding the use of water in the bore hole of a well. The filtrate from a water-base mud may cause clays in the formation to swell and disperse, with consequent severe damage to well productivity. In zones of low permeability, greatly increased water saturation around the bore hole may not be subsequently displaced easily by oil, with consequent decrease in or loss of ability of the well to produce oil. Many instances are on record where a formation of proved productivity has been exposed to water or water-base mud, following which production was greatly decreased or, in some cases, completely lost. Such formations are, characteristically, composed of argillaceous sand, with formations of lowest permeability being most susceptible to damage . Operations in formations of this type appear to offer the greatest promise for the use of oil-base fluids.Oil alone is rather obviously the simplest of the oil-base drilling fluids. It is used extensively, usually in the form of a stabilized crude oil, in completion and workover operations. It is usedless frequently in drilling because it does not suspend cuttings or weighting material and because it does not have the ability to form a filter cake on the wall of the bore hole and thus restrict the loss of fluid into permeable formations. Essentially all modifications of this simplest oil-base system have been directed toward obtaining satisfactory suspending and filtration characteristics.",,American Petroleum Institute

Besides assisting exploration well planning, improved resolution may define local pressure variations around a reservoir that assists field appraisal and development.

Holiday(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-55-247,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Factors that affect well-bore deviation are discussed in light of control procedures. Field results are analyzed to indicate the relative influence of drill-collar size and stabilizers on deviation control. It is shown that within conditions of normal field use, weight on bit to maintain a constant deviation varies approximately as the 2.5 power of drill collar diameter, and that weight on bit can be increased approximately 60 percent through proper use of stabilizers. Stabilizer position for optimum results and uses of various stabilizer arrangements are discussed with attendant field data. An example of the import of deviation control is given with drilling times related to control methods.INTRODUCTIONThe control of hole deviation and difficulties that can be incurred when deviation is not controlled are among the most costly problems associated with oil-well drilling. The often-used practice of reducing drilling weight to prevent excessive deviation can greatly increase cost through attendant low drilling rates. More obvious is the cost of not controlling deviation when reflected by keyseat trouble and subsequent fishing of stuck pipe. Consequently, methods of controlling deviation, which do not interfere with drilling progress can contribute materially to reductions in drilling cost. It is the purpose of this report to show these methods through discussion of factors that affect deviation and analysis of field results.Factors that Influence Hole DeviationAs a vertical drill string cannot resist lateral forces, it is impossible to drill a vertical hole under oil-field conditions. Consequently, a discussion of factors that affect hole deviation is concerned only with an inclined hole. In a straight inclined hole, the drill-collar string is centered in the hole at the bottom by the bit but deflects or sags to the low side and contacts the wall of the hole at some point above the bit. With no weight on the bit, the only force acting on the bit is the resultant of the weight of the drill collars be1ow the contact point. This force tends to bring the hole back to vertical. When weight is added to the bit, as shown in Fig. l a , the weight of the drill collars below the pointPprovides a forceFAwhich tends to bring the hole back to vertical. However, the weight on bitFB is in effect applied from the contact pointPto the bit at an angle greater than the angle of the hole, which tends to increase deviation, In the absence of interference from the formations penetrated, the resultant of forcesFAandFB would determine the angle at which the hole drilled. The formations penetrated can contribute substantially to deviation tendency, however, and must be considered even though the nature of its effect is not known. As it is primarily of concern when contributing to hole angle, formation influence is included here as the factor EF tending to cause deviation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Fields(The Atlantic Refining Co.),,,,,,API-55-266,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Since the first low-temperature separation unit entered the market in competition with conventional separation methods a few years ago, there has been a ready acceptance of this type of equipment for handling gas-condensate well production. This paper briefly reviews general process descriptions of various equipment types presently available. It defines applications for these process types in relation to specific conditions. Also given are criteria useful in making economic justifications of low-temperature separation and stabilization equipment over conventional equipment. There is an apparent economic trend toward the selection of glycol-type low-temperature separation with stabilization for handling gas-condensate well production. Because of this, process variations and application conditions are covered on these methods in greater detail. The paper concludes that all types of low-temperature separation equipment with attendant stabilization should be investigated for selecting the most economical handling method suitable for a particular set of conditions. Particular attention should be given to both practical and economic considerations in selecting the various process innovations which are available with the method chosen.DISCUSSIONThe information and criteria presented have been developed from the experience obtained in the installation and operation of 24 LTS (low-temperature separation) units of various types and 6 cold feed stabilizers. The LTS units range in capacity from 2 1/2 to 60 MMcf per day. The stabilizers range in capacity from 100 to 2,000 bbl per day. These installations have been made during the period from September 1950 to the present time. The smallest of the LTS units, 2 1/2 MMcf per day capacity, is an abbreviated mechanical LTS unit without free-water knockout or regenerative heat exchanger. This unit takes production from a single gas-condensate well and uses three-stage separation. The largest, the 60 MMcf per day capacity unit, is a multiple pressure system glycol-injection unit. It takes production from 28wells and uses a 2,000 bbl per day condensate stabilizer.Before proceeding with the economic criteria, it will be necessary to examine briefly the types of LTS and stabilizers that are being used. The abbreviated- type mechanical LTS unit can be seen in Fig. 1. It is a cold separator with a choke at the inlet and a means for melting hydrates in the bottom. Fig. 2 shows the full mechanical LTS unit. It consists of a cold separator similar to the abbreviated type ; but, in addition, a free-water knockout and regenerative heat exchanger with appropriate temperature controls are included. Although not shown in Fig. 1 or 2, a second stage of separation is considered advisable in the installation of either abbreviated mechanical or full mechanical LTS.The glycol-injection type LTS unit is represented in Fig. 3. It consists of a glycol-oil separator, indirect heater, glycol regenerator, and glycol pumps in addition to the equipment and controls of the full mechanical unit. Fig. 4 shows a diagram of a high-pressure stabilizer which uses a salt-bath heater as a reboiler because of the higher bottom temperature required. A low-pressure stabilizer is shown in Fig. 5 with a 15-lb working pressure steam generator and bottom steam coil which will satisfactorily furnish the required temperature.",,American Petroleum Institute

Magber(Delta Drilling Co.),,,,,,API-55-282,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Varied factors, chiefly cost, have contributed to the reluctance of operators to utilize drilling methods in the Appalachian Basin. Introduction of air and gas as the drilling medium has accelerated penetration rates and expedited completions to such an extent that the use of rotary should at least be considered, for almost every drilling program in the BasinINTRODUCTIONIn the years previous to 1951 several rotary holes were dug in the Appalachian Basin with no marked degree of success, when compared with cable-tool operations. Cost, of course, became the prime factor to discourage continued use of the rotaries. The high costs resulted from expensive movements of equipment, lack of information and experience with formations, remoteness of adequate supply sources, and abrasive sandstones at shallow depths which slowed penetration.Subsequent to 1951, continued use of rotaries saw a reduction in costs through increased drilling speeds and technique improvements with fluid methods. The introduction of air as the circulation medium in 1954 approximately doubled previous penetration rates; cost commensurately declined to a competitive basis with cable tools in known areas of operations. . Reference will be made to fluid methods throughout this paper, as compared with air methods. The term fluid embraces any combination of mud, water, and chemicals ordinarily used in this area as a drilling medium to lift the cuttings and retain hole stability.Review of Pre-Air Rotary OperationsThe few rotary holes made prior to 1951 went to varied depths and horizons in all parts of the Basin. However, their comparative data cannot be accurately compiled because of this variance. Penetration accomplishments can be summarized with this statistical generalization for hole drilled below surface or water-string casing. (The formula is available in full paper)With the discovery of the Leidy Gas Field in Clinton County, Pa., the need for speedy completions became apparent to combat offset drainage. The added discovery of the near-by Driftwood-Benezette Gas Field caused approximately 12 rotary rigs to be brought into Pennsylvania. Operations were chiefly in these two fields where similar conditions prevailed both as to terrain and formations drilled. Continued usage, technique improvements, and adaptations to the immediate problems caused time and cost to reduce quite steadily. The following comparison reflects the increased penetration performance of representative fluid-method rotary holes. (The formula is available in full paper)Use of Air-drilling TechniquesIn March 1954 compressed air was utilized to drill the New York State Natural Gas Corporation, State Tract No. 32, Well No. 384 in the Benezette Gas Field, Elk County, Pa. Attempts were made to air-drill the surface hole (12 &frac12;-in.), but the available compressor volume and pressure were not sufficient to handle the waters encountered near the top of the hole. Fluid methods were resumed to drill this surface hole, and water-string casing was set at 723 ft.",,American Petroleum Institute

The use of refrigeration to process gas streams has proved an important addition to oil absorption and other existing methods. The advantage becomes particularly marked in those cases where only small quantities of gas are available. Stock-tank liquid recovery and revenue are considered in this paper. Those high-pressure wells where the necessary refrigeration is produced by expansion have been excluded, inasmuch as they involve somewhat different economics. Three types of refrigeration systems are discussed, viz., compression refrigeration, ammonia absorption, and Servel-type.INTRODUCTIONThe conservation of oil and gas by the use of surface equipment has become of widespread interest because it has provided sound economics in most instances. Consequently, more interest has been evidenced by producers in these methods. Because of the many factors involved, it is impossible to consider all in this discussion. The use of refrigeration to process gas streams has proved an important addition to oil absorption and other existing methods. Refrigeration is not a cure-all for all processing problems, but it does often offer economic advantage, particularly with relatively rich gas streams. The advantage becomes particularly marked in those cases where only small quantities of gas are available. The chief application is in those situations where the quantity of gas and/or the reserves do not justify a gasoline plant. There are many such cases where the casing-head or well-stream gas may be profitably processed to advantage. The primary factors to be considered are:Quantity of gasReservesMarket situationWell-streani compositionSeparation temperature and pressureAmount of liquid recoverableGas sales specifications:Water dew pointHeating valueAmount of liquifiable hydrocarbons in sales gas.The amount of gas processed on the lease normally varies from 1 to 5 MMcf per day. When more than 5 MMcf per day are available, more complex, facilities are usually justified; whereas a payout may seldom be shown for less than 1 MMcf per day. For these quantities of gas it is imperative that investment and operating costs be held to a minimum. Consequently the high recovery efficiencies desirable in gasoline-plant operation do not always offer favorable economics in lease processing. The cost of equipment and storage necessary to recover substantial portions of the propane and butane is often out of proportion to their market value, especially since the marketing of small quantities of LPG components is often uncertain. Past engineering analyses, for example, have often shown that the most favorable economics are offered by recovering only liquid that may be held in atmospheric storage and sold as crude oil.",,American Petroleum Institute

Three basic sizes of rigs are outlined and it is shown that, by proper attention to the manner in which conventional or near-conventional components of drilling rigs are put together to form the integral unit, the user can obtain a plant which can be moved with less expense and which will have horsepower available when and where needed. Proper-phase parallel operation of two mud pumps is reviewed and the use of torque converters in mud-pump drives for automatic pump-speed control is investigated. Brief discussion is devoted to the use of universal joints in rig power transmissions to add rig flexibility. Future design considerations that will enable the manufacture of rigs which can be moved within the limits of legal highway load and size specifications are highlighted; and further discussion centers around portable-mast types which can be legally moved without disassembly or with a minimum of disassemblyINTRODUCTIONWithin the past few years there has been progress on rig design and operation of drilling equipment which has added true meaning to the often-used drilling industry terms of rigbalance, flexibility, andportability. For future reference, these terms will, at the outset, be defined in accordance with the author's interpretation.Abalancedrig, as commonly referred to, implies a unit all of whose components, in work expectancy, are matched or balanced. The integral balanced rig is composed of hoisting tackle, drawworks, compound, engines, power-transmission elements, rotary machinery, pumps, etc. with equivalent power, tonnage or other conventional ratings which, at full design load, are all working at maximum capacity within the allowances of intelligent design factors.Flexibilityinfers a rig design which allows economic utilization of the rig over a relatively wide depth range. The term flexible, when referred to the rig make-up, also suggests a power-plant transmission arrangement which allows multiple utilization of all major horsepower on the rig. In such a rig all, or the majority, of the installed horsepower is arranged to permit its use, when required, for pumping, turning the rotary table, or hoisting as the need is dictated. A fu1ly flexible power package has few, if any, standby or single-purpose engines. Portability in a drilling rig is recognized in its ease of moving, rigging up, and rigging down; and is exemplified in a drilling plant composed of a relatively small number of unitized packages for each respective depth-capacity rig.It will be the purpose of this paper to highlight recent trends in drilling-rig design which have emphasized these features-balance, flexibility,andportability-as design criteria and to offer some thought to yet-untried arrangements of conventional rig components which amplify these desirable features.RIG TREND INFLUENCESTwo types of drilling rigs, which have had major influences on current industry rig design and thinking, have been placed in service during the past four years. These are:the split-compound rig; andthe dual trailer rig.",,American Petroleum Institute

These questionnaires covered 34 factors or items which each operator was asked to check, showing general practice and rating of the importance of the factor. Individual well-data cards also were circulated for operators to fill out after each of their next five jobs showing the procedures used on the job and the results obtained. The results of these questionnaires are summarized and tabulated in this report. The committee, in addition to summarizing the results of the questionnaires, make their own recommendations as to what they believe to be the best practice concerning each of the items.INTRODUCTIONDuring the API Mid-Continent District spring meeting at Wichita, Kansas, in March 1952, the Study Committee on Cementing Practices and Testing of Oil-well Cements was requested to make a study of surface casing cementing and open-hole plug-back practices. If possible, this study was to determine what factors contribute to failures, and to arrive at recommendations that might help eliminate failures on these types of jobs in the future.In order to carry out this assignment, the study committee sent questionnaires to each company doing these types of cementing jobs to find out what general procedures were followed. Each company also was sent individual well-data cards on which to report the exact procedure followed on each of the next five jobs performed. The committee hoped to learn from the questionnaires what practices the various companies follow in general, and to gather specific information from the well-data cards on a large number of jobs so that specific job failures might be studied.The questionnaire for operator's description of general surface casing cementing practice (Appendix B,Item A) covered 19 factors with space for the operators to check their general practice on each. They were asked also to indicate the importance which they attached to each of the factors by marking them A, B, or C where:most important considerationsfactors which should be considered, but which are not included in any specific instructions.relatively unimportant considerations.The questionnaire for operator's description of genera1 open-hole plug-back cementing practice (Item B) covered 15 factors which the operators were asked to check and rate in the same manner as those on surface casing cementing practices.The surface casing data card (Item C) contained 24 questions to be answered concerning each specific job. The open-hole plug-back data card (Item D) contained 19 such questions. Items A, B,C, and D are included as Appendix B to this paper.In addition to the specific questions on the questionnaire and well-data cards, provision was made for remarks where additional information could be given in detail. The questionnaires also had space for the operators to describe an) failures they might have had during the past year and what, if anything, had been done to eliminate such failures.From service-company records, a rather extensive list was compiled of operators who had performed surface casing or open-hole plug-back jobs in the Mid-Continent District during the first five months of 1953.

Water Hooding was first undertaken in California in 1946; and, as of December 1, 1954, there were 34 active projects in the state . The number of floods has increased markedly since 1951, when the peacetime crude-oil demand began exceeding the supply. The average California flood produces from a depth of 3,100 ft from an anticline of Miocene age having a perforated zonal thickness of 240 ft and a formation dip of 17 deg. The average sand has a permeability of 480 md and contains a 23 API oil which has a viscosity of 44 cp at reservoir conditions. The majority of floods were started following careful preliminary engineering analyses. No difficulties appear to have been encountered as a result of either the relatively high oil viscosity or the rather large average zonal thickness. Injection-well plugging has not been a serious problem, and it has been found that no elaborate water-treatment techniques need to be used. No data are available to evaluate increased oil recoveries which may result from the water injectionINTRODUCTIONThe Study Committee on Fluid Injection of the API Pacific Coast District Committee on Production Practice appointed a subcommittee in 1954 to review water-flooding operations in California. The committee members are N. van Wingen, Chairman, H. D. Aggers, E. S. Boyer, D. K. Hayward, and A. G. Loomis.The committee's investigation was primarily concerned with secondary-recovery operations or those water floods which were instigated at a time when the reservoir pressure had declined to a value substantially less than the original. Injection projects which were instigated principally for the purpose of waste-water disposal have been considered in this investigation where such water is being injected into an oil-producing zone. It is believed that these operations are potential secondary-recovery projects. Data for four pressure-maintenance projects utilizing high-pressure water-injection in the North Coles Levee, South Cuyama, Greeley, and Rio Bravo F'ields have not been included in this study. For various reasons it was not possible to obtain information for two projects which do fall within the scope of this investigation.California Water-injection ProjectsAs of December 1, 1954, there were 34 active secondary-recovery projects in California, as based on the conditions stated in the introduction. Data were made avai1ab1e to the committee for 32 of these operations. The geographic location of these projects is shown in Fig. 1. Three additional projects had been suspended as of January 1, 1954. These suspended floods and their period of operation were as follows (Fig.1 is available in full paper)The 32 active floods for which the committee received data represent a total ,area of production of 2,500 acres including 92 injection wells, with a total water-injection rate of 73,000 bbl per day for conditions as of December 1, 1954.",,American Petroleum Institute

Jenkins(Battelle Memorial Institute Columbus Ohio),,,,,,API-55-374,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Resistances to failure of oil-well casing are computed for three cases of non-uniform loading-a unidirectional distributed load, a pair of opposed line . loads, and a pair of opposed 1ine loads with constraint in the perpendicular direction. Three to four times the wall thickness is required for the foregoing cases to obtain the same failure resistances as for hydrostatic-pressure loading on casing meeting API specifications. The computational technique for treating the general loading case is discussed.INTRODUCTIONCurrently, tabu1ated values of the collapse strengths of oil-well casing1are based on hydrostatic- pressure loading on the outside of casing having the maximum permissible API tolerance for initial out-of-roundness. It is of interest to ascertain the failure resistances of casing subjected to loading other than hydrostatic, such as may result in practice from collapsing or plastically flowing underground formations.The foregoing conditions have been experienced in the Williston Basin, North Dakota, where several salt beds having thicknesses up to 75 ft are present in the Spearfish and Charles formations. These salt beds are found in an interval of some 2,000 ft, from 6,000 to 8,000 ft below the surface.Failures of casing in salt sections have occurred from a few weeks to over three years after the casing was run. Failure was presumably the result of non-uniform loading on the casing arising from the plastic flow of salt against the casing in an incompletely cemented enlarged hole. Rock salt would exhibit slow creep at the ambient temperature and overburden pressures in question.In order to lend some verification to the foregoing hypothesis as to the cause of the casing failures, the Amerada Petroleum Corporation was interested in the fai1ure resistances of oil-well casing subjected to non-uniform transverse loading for comparisons with the known collapse resistances of casing subjected to hydrostatic pressure loading.Three cases of loading are considered in this paper, viz.:A uni-directional load applied on half the outer surface of the casing, uniformly distributed along a diameter, and a corresponding load in the opposite sense on the other half, together with hydrostatic pressure on the inner surface.Opposed line loads on opposite ends of a diameter on the outer surface, together with hydrostatic pressure inside.Opposed line loads on opposite ends of a diameter outside combined with complete restraint to radial displacement at the ends of the perpendicular diameter, together kith hydrostatic pressure inside.The foregoing three loading conditions are special cases of balanced, two-dimensional loading. Possible bending of the axis of the casing and twisting of the casing about its axis are not considered.",,American Petroleum Institute

Moore(Columbian Carbon Company W.Va),,,,,,API-55-379,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"Since the Stano1ind Oil and Gas Company announced the development of hydraulic fracturing methods for well treatment for increased production of oil and gas in 1948, widespread use of the process has been tried in the Illinois Basin and in Ohio. Increased use is indicated in West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, and Pennsylvania with limited use in Maryland, New York, and Virginia. The trend of fracturing in Eastern United States is to larger volumes of fracturing fluid and larger amounts of sand in each treatment. The results of fracturing are varied; but indications are that the initial production after fracturing is higher than from shooting, and that a rapid initial decline after fracturing begins to level out and approaches a normal decline curve for a shot or natural well in from one to four months time. Results indicate that:wells with high primary production do not respond to fracturing as well as those with tight, low-permeable sands;many commercial wells may be obtained by fracturing which would have been non-commercial previously;wells treated in old shot holes or loose formations should be treated with the gel frac where there is a gelling agent to hold sand in suspension; andwells treated in tight formations may use the Sand Frac treatment.HISTORY OF FRACTURINGIn October 1948 the Stanolind Oil and Gas Company made the first public announcement of their development of hydraulic-fracturing methods for well treatment for increasing production of oil and gas. This procedure was believed to be feasible both for treating new wells and to revive old production. In March 1949 these procedures, known as Hydrafrac Service, were commercially introduced to the oil and gas industry. Since the beginning of these commercial operations, many thousands of fracturing treatments have been performed on wells throughout the world. Fracturing procedures are recognized by some members of the industry to have probably done more for improving production from wells than any other development in the history of the oil and gas industry. The basic hydrafrac process was designed to increase well productivity by increasing the permeability of producing formations. The basic process consisted of three main steps:Injecting into formations a highly viscous liquid, either hydrocarbon or water-base, containing a granular-type material, such as sand, for a propping agent, under high hydraulic pressure to fracture the formation. This hydraulic fracturing of the formation is accomplished by exerting pressure in excess of that caused by the over burden and the pressure is transmitted to the formation by the ,highly viscous fluids pumped into the treated zone. This in effect increases the permeability of the producing formation in the vicinity of the bore hole.The high1y viscous liquid, with its propping agent, is followed down the well with a breaker agent which is a chemical dissolved in oil; and within a short period of time this chemica1 causes the gel to revert to a low viscous fluid.As the highly viscous fluid reverts to a low viscous fluid, the .sand, on the release of the excessive pressure which was necessary to fracture the formation, acts a s a propping agent to hold open the fracture; and the natural production flushes the treating chemicals from the formation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hughes(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-55-402,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"A brief historical review is presented covering development of theories on the migration and accumulation of petroleum leading up to a summary of M. Ling Hubbert's theory of entrapment of petroleum. under hydrodynamic conditions. The possible application of Hubbert's explanations for ti1ted water tables is briefly discussed in relation to increasing recoveries in natural water-drive fields, water-flood operations, gas-drive, and gas-cycling operations:INTRODUCTIONPresent-day studies and research on the origin, migration, and accumulation of petroleum are often referred to asDiscovery Thinking. Such studies and research are usually conducted by, or supervised by geologists. Practically all acceptable early theories were proposed by, or influenced by geologists. As a result, those in the production end of the petroleum industry seldom pay much attention to progress made in discovery thinking. Production personnel are usually interested in this kind of geological work only insofar-as it may mean more fields for them to develop and to produce. This discussion is based largely upon the premise that the more we learn about the origin, migration, and accumulation of petroleum the better we can develop and produce our fields.Theories on the origin of petroleum are far more controversial than those on accumulation. It is generally agreed that we need source beds and carrier beds and structural or stratigraphic traps to have oil accumulations. Industry and others have been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to determine what source beds are, why and where they are deposited, and how organic matter within then1 may be converted to petroleum For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that source beds are probably of marine origin in the form of clays, shales, and lime muds. Carrier beds are any more or less continuous permeable beds overlying or underlying source beds and through which petroleum, once formed, may move toward and into areas of entrapment. The need for carrier beds naturally brings up the question as to how and how far petroleum migrates from source beds to its place of entrapment. This, in turn, brings up another question as to whether underground waters associated with virgin oil accumulations are in a static or a dynamic condition. A stand must be taken for oil could migrate very much greater distances under dynamic water conditions than under static water conditions. Early theories on the origin and accumulation of petroleum were based on geologic structure and static water conditions.Structural Theories1Sir William Logan, Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, is credited with first noting that oil seeps were located on anticlinal structures. He pointed out this observation in 1844 with respect to occurrences in Gaspe at the mouth of the St. LawrenceRiver. Professor Henry D. Rogers, of the University of Glasgow, Scotland, pointed out in. 1860thatthe oil at and near Drake's discovery well occurred in anticlinal structures. In 1861, T.Sterry Hunt, also of the Geological Survey of Canada, made the first clear statement of the structural or anticlinal theory of acctimulation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Krause(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-55-413,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"INTRODUCTIONThe API Southwestern District Study Committee on Casing Landing Practice was organized in March, 1952. Its objective was to prepare a recommendation on a standard procedure for landing and hanging casing from the time the cement plug hit bottom until the time the casing hanger was installed and the casing set on the hanger, being held by slips or threads. Preliminary activity included considerable investigation of past reports, records, and correspondence covering the subject and a questionnaire was circulated to the industry in the southwestern United States. A summary of the data obtained by the questionnaire is presented as Table 1 (see p. 419 ). More detailed information on committee activity and discussion appears on p. 10-15 in Reports of Meetings, Southwestern and Mid-Continent District Drilling and Production Practice Committees, API Circ. D473, May 10, 1954.Table 1 reflects information obtained from 21 operators, including most of the larger operators in the Southwestern District. In all, 60 area reports were returned. The reporting companies drilled 3,686 wells in 1952, ranging in depth from 2,000 ft to 14,000 ft and averaging around 8,000 ft. The various areas are defined by the map (Fig. 1). In Table 1 data has been compiled by area reports, or a combination of area reports where practices were identical for the same company. The 60 area reports have been reduced to 40 for convenience in preparing the table.Col. 1 shows the geographical areas into which the Southwestern District was divided for purposes of this survey, and the number of wells drilled by an operator in an area or areas in 1952 is shown in Col. 2. Col. 3 shows the average depth of the wells or the variation in depth where the spread is too great for an average to reflect the true scope of depths involvedCol 4 reflects answers received from the question Does your company have a standard or recommended procedure as to the amount of tension to be left in the casing string when it is landed on the wellhead casing hanger? The results show 29Yesand 11NOanswers. However, it is evident from a study made of the comments and actual practices indicated that a number of companies answeredYeswhen the answer should have beenNO, or that even though the company had a standard recommended procedure, the procedure was not being followed in the field.Col. 5, 6, 7, and 8 came under the broad heading Reported Casing Landing Practices and indicate the most common methods in use. They are:As Cemented. In this method the casing was considered to be in full tension as it was cemented and the only movement of the pipe after cementing was that necessary to transfer the weight of the casing to the wellhead hanger. Five large operators in 15 operating areas, representing 1,481 wells ranging in depth from 2,000 to 13,400 ft indicated this landing practice, and in only one instance was excess tension a contributing factor to a failure and that simply involved overloading of an inadequate surface casing joint in compression, causing it to collapse.",,American Petroleum Institute

Woodard(Dowell Incorporated),,,,,,API-55-451,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1955,"The application of oil-cement slurries to selectively block off unwanted water production from oil wells has been developed and improved, expanding its use and increasing the percentage of successful shut-offs obtained. The modified technique utilizes, basically, a low-pressure displacement of the oil-cement slurry, overflushed with crude oil. By the use of low-fluid-loss slurry, the slurry remains fluid and does not lock up with resultant high pressures and possible blocking of oil zones as well as water zones .This low-fluid-loss characteristic makes possible the use of large-volume treatments, with little or no damage to the oil-producing horizon, after overflushing the slurry with crude oil. In many instances, the wells can be put back on production without further remedial work. This technique is applicable both in wells having natural water encroachment, and those in which water has been encountered as a result of fracturing operations.INTRODUCTIONThe use of oil-cement slurries in oil wells to selectively shut off water without materially restricting oil production, has furnished a new approach to one of the oil industry's oldest problems. Brine production from an oil well is both troublesome and expensive to an oil operator. In addition to increased lifting costs, there are the problems of brine separation and disposal, and the coning effect of rapid encroachment with resultant bypassing of oil in the formation. The utilization of fracturing processes in the development of marginal areas has, in some cases, created new brine-control difficulties.A number of different methods have been utilized to shut off unwanted water, with varying degrees of success. Probably the most familiar and widely used technique has been the conventional cement squeeze, to seal off the water-bearing formation. This process has been popular because it is inexpensive, fast and in many cases successful; however, it also has a number of disadvantages.The primary disadvantage of water-cement slurries. is that they are non-selective, shutting off oil-producing and water zones alike. In some cases, oil production may not be completely recovered following subsequent perforating operations. Premature setting or improper placement of the slurry may result in expensive remedial operations as the result of cementing the squeeze tool in the hole. In some cases they may even result in loss of the well.selective CementingThe most recent development in the control of brine production from oil wells has been the application of selective cementing techniques using a slurry composed of portland cement suspended in oil, together with a surface tension lowering agent. This oil slurry is pumped into the well and displaced into the exposed formation. Because the cement requires water to convert it from a fluid slurry to a rigid, impermeable mass, it does not solidify as long as it remains suspended in an oil medium. Upon contacting formation brine, however, the cement should set up, blocking that particular portion of the formation where the brine is encountered. In the oil-producing zones, the cement would remain suspended and be produced out of the well after the squeeze treatment.",,American Petroleum Institute

In all other cases, however, the difficulties were quite seriousConsiderable impetus to the use of the method was given during World War II because of shortage of steel Even then, however, the method was considered an expedient it is only in the past few years, in fact in the last two or three years, that development of appropriate surface and subsurface equipment has made possible large-scale use of dual completion The trend in the use of dual completions may be illustrated by the increase in number of such completions made annually in the State of Texas Fifteen years ago, for all practical purposes, no dual completions were made in this state The following tabulation, based on the records of the Texas Railroad Commission, shows the number of dual completions made in Texas each year during the past six years(Available in full paper)GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSIf two zones are to be produced through one well bore without commingling of fluids, two conductors are needed which are entirely isolated from each other in any conventional well two such conductors are already available, one being the tubing and the other the casing annulus It is understandable, therefore, that in the first arrangements for dual completions, tubing and annulus were utilized for production of the two zones This solution, however, had a number of disadvantagesThe flow through the annulus, whether it is a natural flow or one induced by gas lift, is very inefficient primarily because of turbulence around the couplings of the inner string In the case of natural flow, the flowing life of the zone producing through the annulus is therefore shortened With gas lift, excessive gas-oil",,American Petroleum Institute

Stone(Lafayette La),,,,,,API-56-414,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1956,"The authors resent some of the problems encountered in treating gas-lift wells for corrosion. A new method of treating these wells by squeezing 11 wells in one field are given back into the formation is discussed. The results of squeezing 11 wells in one field are given. The individual histories of 5 of these wells are presented. The treating efficiency, or the percent reduction of iron content of produced fluid, was increased 16.9 percent by the squeeze treatment and the treating cost was lowered 49.9 percent.INTRODUCTIONCorrosion control of gas-lift wells has become a difficult problem. Usually the corrosion that occurs in these wells is of the water-dependent type, i e , the wells produce for a number of years without corrosion but when the water production increases sufficiently, corrosion becomes severe. Corrosion control of gas-lift wells is difficult for the following reasons 1, limitation of treating methods; 2, inability to control chemical- injection location; and 3, inability to economically measure corrosiveness of fluid or to measure the amount of corrosion occurring in the well. This paper mill discuss these problems and show what steps have been taken by Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company to overcome them. To limit the scope of the paper, the corrosion control program of the Placedo Field, Victoria County, Texas, will be discussed.HISTORY OF PLACED0 FIELD CORROSIONThis field was developed in 1936 and 1937 and was produced with no corrosion damage to well equipment for 12 years. Most of the wells in this field are completed in the Greta sand or in a stronger sand slightly above the Greta at a depth of approximately 4,700 ft. The Greta sand is a very loose unconsolidated sand with a permeability of 3,000 to 5,000 millidarcys, and a porosity of 32 to 34 percent Tubing failures resulting from corrosion were first noticed in 1948; and by 1951 the corrosion had become a severe problem Several expensive fishing jobs were required and tubing and valve failures became quite numerous In 1951 there were around 20 tubing failures caused by corrosion in a field where we operate only 80 wells The average cost of pulling these wells and replacing the corroded tubing averaged a little over $4,000 per job, giving a total corrosion cost for 1951 of $80,000 Needless to say, corrosion costs in this field were excessive.In late 1951 a program was started to determine how much corrosion was occurring and which wells were being corroded most severely Corrosion test coupons were installed in the high water-producing wells, call per surveys were run, and iron content of the produced water was determined. The caliper surveys showed that the tubing in each of the wells with a high water producing rate was in very poor condition. The results from the surface coupons were very inconclusive, in fact, most of the coupons gave a corrosion rate of 2 to 4 mils per year regardless of the well's productivity.",,American Petroleum Institute

Clark Jr.(Baker Oil Tools Inc.),,,,,,API-56-424,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1956,"Much has already been published to bring to light the fact that pressure surges can be a major factor in lost circulation. It is the of this paper to clarify when and how these pressure surges take place and point out the important factors which must be controlled in order to reduce them.The general conclusion is that there are very few natural combinations of geostatic and hydrostatic gradients that cannot be successfully drilled, provided1,operators are willing to put forth the time and effort required for proper mud control, and2,drilling crews can be trained away from the time-honored practice of running and pulling pipe in a fast and rough manner.INTRODUCTIONAs early as 19341the effect of pipe motion on down-hole hydraulics appeared in print as a possible explanation of the phenomena of blowouts and lost circulation. In 1951 Goins, et al.,2conclusively proved this relationship for the problem of lost circulation by a very comprehensive empirical association between down-hole pressure surges and lost circulation For the conditions under which they mere drilling, the elimination of pressure surges completely eliminated the problem More recently other authors3 4 5have presented a means of mathematically predicting the magnitude of these surges for any well, thus making possible the information presented in this paper.The Relationship Between Bottom-hole Pressure, Blowout and Lost CirculationIn any oil well, regardless of the formation, there are certain limits within which the total bottom-hole pressure must be contained to prevent serious problems The lower limit is generally determined either by hole-sloughing problems or by formation fluid pressures, whereas the upper limit is determined by the formation strength as associated not only with the problem of lost circulation but also with the problem of zonal intermingling resulting from fractures.Fig. 1 shows a typical relationship that could exist in a given well among formation pressure, static mud weight, initial breakdown, strength after breakdown, and mud-weight variations resulting from pipe handling. Initially, the static mud weight of this well can safely vary all the way from 78 lb per cu ft (10.5 lb per gal) up to 110 lb per cu ft (147 lb per gal) At pressures equivalent to mud weights less than this, formation fluids or gases will enter the well bore, whereas at values higher than the upper limit, the formation will begin to break down Once such a breakdown has occurred, the formation strength will invariably be lowered temporarily, and, in many cases, permanently. Consequently, should any occasion occur wherein the walls of the well are opened up, the allowable bottom-hole pressure IS reduced to the area labeled safe pressure range after breakdown, or reduced to cover only mud weights ranging from 78 lb per cu ft (105 lb per gal) to 100 lb per cu ft (134 lb per gal).Static mud weight alone, however, does not describe the total pressure existing in the well bore.",,American Petroleum Institute

Storage wells have been completed In sands which occur at depths of 3.300 ft and 3,600 ft These sands have extremely active water drives which provide the energy to flow the LPG back to the refinery in a liquid state ready for sale. Several yearly cycles of storage and withdrawal have now been completed and the project has been found to be profitable. Recoveries of 55 percent or more of the stored products have been obtained with each cycle.The storage reservoirs are being used primarily for yearly seasonal storage to make the summer surplus available during the winter demand period. It has also been found that the ease with which the liquids can be stored or withdrawn has provided a valuable operating flexibility when various units of the refinery which make or use LPG are offstream.This paper describes the project and gives the history of its operation.INTRODUCTIONThe summer surplus of LPG has caused the oil industry to seek a means of economically storing large quantities of these fuels so that they can be made available during the winter demand period. Surface storage is dangerous and expensive because the liquids are highly flammable and must be kept under pressure Underground storage has furnished one solution to these problems and a number of successful projects have been in operation in the Mid-Continent and in the East where caverns washed out of salt domes have been utilized.At El Segundo, near Los Angeles, Standard Oil Company of California operates a unique underground storage project on fee land where propane and butane are being stored In water sands with extremely active water drives. The original purpose of the storage project was to build up storage in the summer for withdrawal during the winter As the operation progressed. however, the wells were found to be useful for temporary storage when various units of the refinery which make or use LPG were offstream.This temporary storage feature has contributed greatly to the operating flexibility of the refinery.LocationThe underground storage project has been developed In water sands of the El Segundo Gas Field which is on the north edge of the old El Segundo Oil Field Fig 1 shows the location of the field in relation to other Los Angeles Basin fields The gas field 1s located about one mile east of the city of El Segundo, California, and is adjacent to the El Segundo Refinery of the Standard Oil Company of CaliforniaHistoryThe El Segundo Oil Field was discovered in 1935 About 75 oil wells were drilled to sands in the interval of 6,800 ft to 7,200 ft.

There is now oil excuse for drilling into the sand without knowing it.Coring has become routine and recovery now approaches 100 percent Shale can be cut with a diamond bit almost as fast as sand.

During this period substantial and satisfactory data have been accumulated This paper deals with many of the trials and tribulations encountered and the steps taken to overcome them.Early ExperimentationIn January 1955, while attempting to evaluate the potentialities of a prospective water flood In Callahan County, Texas, the Overby Drilling Company was employed to take a core of the Tannehill producing sand found at a depth of approximately 400 ft The rig used for this purpose was a Mayhew No. 1000, equipped with both mud pump and compressor, integrally mounted. The compressor was a single-stage unit with a capacity of 315 cu ft per min. Although the normal operating pressure during drilling was sustained at 40 psi to 50 psi, the compressor was capable of a temporary peak pressure of 125 psi. A 4 1/2-in hole was drilled to 396 ft with a conventional rotary bit in an elapsed time of slightly less than 4 hours The bit was then replaced with a drag-type coring bit, mounted on a conventional core barrel, and the well was cored from a depth of 396 ft to 419 ft in approximately 3 hours.

These intentionally off-vertical wells are called slant wells, slant holes, directionally drilled holes or wells, etc The current favored term seems to be deviated holes As a class presenting unique problems, it might be reasonable to describe such holes as wells terminating in angles exceeding 30 deg measured from the verticalThe general well profile consists of three portions- a vertical section which may extend no deeper than 100 ft, ail arc section at a nearly constant buildup of 2 deg to 6 deg per 100 ft, and a terminal slant section extending from the lower arc tangent point to the pump. Terminal angles as high as 75 deg from the vertical and measured depths to 10,000 ft. have been used in Huntington Beach, California1The general Long Beach and Huntington Beach areas contain some thousand wells of this class, with earliest directional drilling recorded In 1930. Artificial-lift experience from this area is drawn up011 for the following sections.DISCUSSIONThe pumping of highly deviated wells with sucker rods has not presented the severe problem which might be expected, and several hundred such n-ells are produced by this simple means in California. However, well loads are quite different from vertical wells of the same measured depth, and there is need to be able to predict loads, production, and power requirements.In about 1950, this need was great enough to schedule time for a study of the problem; -and inasmuch as the literature appeared devoid of any reference to prediction formulas or methods, relations were derived on a pseudo-scientific basis. By this is meant, in this case, that instead of setting up complete dynamical differential equations, loads were analyzed as static, and impulse corrections applied somewhat as in the formulas commonly used for rod pumping of undeviated wellsWithout going into derivation at this point, it is of interest to follow some of the thinking that indicated the necessity for having methods and which dictated the approach used. For example, the engineer in charge of stalling pumping equipment in these highly deviated wells is faced with such questions as:What kind of peak-load rating will be required for the pumping unit?How should the rod string be designed? Is this critical? Will heavier rods in the lower portion of the string promote faster dropping?What will happen to rod-stroke loss affecting net plunger travel and production?How shall counterbalance be determined? Peak torque? Prime-mover horsepower?How can we tell from a dynagraph card whether there are excessive extraneous loads?In higher-production wells, will the pump plunger perhaps need to be larger than normal, in order to keep pumping rate down and allow the rods to drop?",,American Petroleum Institute

In order not to be repetitious, there will be no detailed description of the pumping method given except to the extent necessary to illustrate its usefulness in the pumping of deviated in congested areas- Fig- 1 and 2 illustrate the system graphically.This type of pumping has been used under conditions similar to those being discussed herein in the Beach, Huntington Beach, and Whittier areas; and results have been such as to warrant consideration of the method for future operations. However, it should be stressed that there ss no one pumping system that is a panacea style system for leases and conditions.Therefore, any method contemplated for use On a particular lease should be thoroughly investigated for compatibility with the particular conditions of the lease before final acceptance of the method. Hydraulic pumping is adaptable to close well spacing, because wellhead equipment can be located on a spacing as close as 5 ft between wells Operations of the system can be safe and clean, and ~t is easily adapted to the installation of all wellhead equipment below ground level, thereby preserving the scenic qualities of an area. Fig 3, a sketch, illustrates this latter pointThe operation of a hydraulic-pump system can also be relatively quiet, inasmuch as electric motors can be used as prime movers Also, it is possible to locate the power plant of the system in a sound-proofed building and operate the wells on a remote-controlled basis, thereby reducing the noise factor to a minimum.Hydraulic pumping also offers the feature of the changing of well pumps without the need for a well-pulling rig. Thus, this feature is certainly important in the fulfilling of the last three enumerated basic requirements of a pumping system for a congested area.Fig. 2 (Lynch)-Flow Diagram of Hydraulic Pumping System (Closed Power Oil)(Available in full paper)Fig. 3 (Lynch)-Multiple Well Cellar(Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Thus, information m addition to the reservoir pressure could be obtained from a single set of data Since 1937, a number of methods for analysis of pressure-buildup data have appeared in the literature2-10, inclThe more recent methods can be used to establish the existence of a zone of altered permeability adjacent to the well bore, as well as other important quantitiesThe purpose of this study is, first, to bring together the several methods suggested for pressure- buildup analysis Similarities and differences between methods can then be pointed out.

Van Poollen(Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.),,,,,,API-57-103,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"Laboratory tests performed by various research organizations have indicated that the different fracturing fluids and their additives have a detrimental effect on the effective permeability of the treated formations. Apparently this effect results in a permeability reduction which extends into the formation to a depth of approximately 1 in. The loss of permeability in the damaged zone ranges from 0 to 95 percent of the original permeability.By means of mathematical analyses of electrical model studies, the influence on productivity is demonstrated, assuming various degrees and depths of damage of the permeability surrounding the well bore and the fracture. Both horizontal and vertical fractures were studied and the flow capacities of the fractures were assigned varying values.The data obtained from these studies indicate:1,increased well productivity can be obtained by fractures opening up a flow channel through the damaged zone (skin) around the well bore;2,the larger the fracture, the greater is the productivity increase;3,an increase in the flow capacity of the fracture results in greater production potential;4,the damage to the formation immediately surrounding the fracture has only a minor effect on the productivity of the well;5,the damage to the fracture flow capacity has a major effect on the productivity of the well; and6,most production will enter the fracture in that portion of the fracture furthest away from the well bore.INTRODUCTIONSince the beginning of hydraulic fracturing eight years ago, various fluids have been used to fracture different subsurface formations and to carry the propping agents necessary to keep the fractures open. These fluids varied from natural crudes and refined oils to salt water and fresh water. Chemical additives were frequently used to custom fit the fracturing fluids for their particular purposes.Frequently this question arose- what are the possible, detrimental effects of the various fracturing fluids and their additives on the effective permeability of the treated formation? Various research organizations and an API study group are a t this time searching for an answer to this question. Unpublished tests indicate that the depth of permeability damage is in the range of 1 in. In this zone the loss of permeability ranges from 0 to 95 percent of the original permeability.In this paper will be found the mathematical analyses of an electrical-model study which will demonstrate the influence on production of various degrees of damage surrounding the well bore and the fracture. Therefore, two electrical models were constructed, one for horizontal and one for vertical fractures. A description of these models can be found in Appendix A.Utilizing these models, two important factors were studied:1,the effect of various fractures on productivity, and2,the pressure profiles surrounding a fracture. The data obtained from1,were plotted for comparison; the pressure profiles,2,were used to calculate the effect of permeability damage on productivity.

The object of the present paper is to review methods for calculating productivity indices and to suggest improvements and modifications in the interpretation of productivity data. One method for determining whether a well is producing without well damage is to compare observed with computed productivity indices. For the computed indices to be meaningful, both the fluid-flow data and the methods of calculating productivities must apply to the flow conditions existing in the reservoir.In the past it has been customary to calculate theoretical production indices using the steady-state, radial flow formula without considering the effect of nonsteady state flow on productivity. Modifications are introduced to improve applicability to transient flow systems frequently encountered in reservoir engineering. The difference in productivities computed from the steady-state and the transient-flow formulas is about 10 percent.Productivities calculated for an example well by the methods in this paper are with those calculated from more exact equations solved on the IBM 701. The difference in calculated productivities was not greater than would be expected from experimental errors normally associated with the basic data required for productivity calculations.The importance of using applicable permeability data is illustrated for a well producing from a solution gas drive reservoir. If incorrect relative oil permeabilities are used in computing productivities, productivity reduction resulting from a normal gas-saturation buildup around the well may be mistakenly attributed to well damage.INTRODUCTIONA quantity frequently used in reservoir engineering is productivity index. It is derived from flow measurements made at the well and is indicative of the producing capacity of the well. In the absence of core data, productivity indices from well performance are sources of reservoir permeability data. For new wells an estimate of well-completion effectiveness can be obtained from a comparison of observed indices with indices calculated from core permeability data when these data are available. Throughout the producing history of the well, productivity- index measurements can be used in determining if the well is producing without well damage. If an abnormal decline is observed, remedial measures may be recommended to improve productivity.An interpretation of productivity indices requires an understanding of the fluid-flow processes which occur in oil reservoirs. The object of the present paper is, therefore, to review methods for calculating productivity indices, in view of our best recent knowledge of the flow processes, and to suggest improvements and modifications in the interpretation of productivity data. The effect on productivity of a gas-saturation buildup around the well bore is discussed. A procedure is presented for estimating oil permeabilities around the well bore from productivity as a function of drawdown.Another method, pressure-buildup analysis, has been used also to obtain information about the fluid-flow properties of oil reservoirs from measurements made at the well. R. L. Perrinelreviewed pressure-buildup analysis in a recent paper. The two methods, productivity-index measurements and pressure-buildup analysis, supplement each other.",,American Petroleum Institute

Binder Jr.(Jersey Production Research Co.),,,,,,API-57-123,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"Conventional methods of producing crude oil generally leave in the depleted reservoir 1 to 3 bbl of oil for every barrel brought to the surface. This paper describes a field test which explores the possibility of using gas-driven liquid propane to improve oil-recovery efficiency.Laboratory theoretical and experimental studies leading to the field test indicated that low residual oil values could be obtained using limited amounts of propane driven by gas. The field test involved1, repressuring the reservoir to the vapor pressure of liquid propane;2, injecting the liquid propane; and3, injecting dry natural gas to drive the propane and oil to the producing wells. Considerable preliminary work, including new drilling, workovers, and a pressure survey, was necessary.During the test, oil-production rates have averaged about 8 times the final primary rates. The field average gas-oil ratio is slightly above the pre-test value. Oil recovery to date is 126,500 stock-tank barrels. About 40 percent of the 143,000 bbl of propane injected has been produced to date. Reults of the C-2 Block test are encouraging, and larger, more definitive field projects are indicated.INTRODUCTIONThe cost of finding new crude-oil reservoirs continues to increase. Today the oil industry is drilling more and deeper wells and making fewer big discoveries. Nevertheless, the demand for oil and oil products increases each year. It is natural that oil companies, faced with this situation, concentrate on recovering more of the oil existing in our known crude-oil reservoirs. There is room for much improvement. For every barrel of oil brought to the surface by present-day methods of producing crude oil, generally 1 to 3 bbl are left behind in the depleted reservoirs.The unrecoverable oil in petroleum reservoirs is largely trapped by capillarity. Inasmuch as flushing with a solvent is exceedingly effective in combatting oil loss resulting from capillarity, much effort in this direction has been made in recent year1,2,3,4,5.Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has been suggested as a relatively inexpensive, abundant, easily recoverable solvent for crude oil. Some operators have observed striking responses in oil recovery at production wells offsetting input wells in LPG storage reservoirs6,7,8. In spite of the low unit cost of LPG, however, it is uneconomic in general to inject a volume of LPG into a reservoir to remove a like volume of oil.A modification of solvent flushing in which a limited quantity of liquid propane is gas driven through a reservoir appears capable of recovering much more than 1 bbl of oil per barrel of propane injected. Also, most of the propane injected should be recoverable for sale or reuse. Inasmuch as such a process could well have widespread and profitable application, The Carter Oil Company and Jersey Production Research Company are making an extensive evaluation of the technique's possibilities.Laboratory development of the gas-driven propane recovery technique was sufficiently encouraging to justify testing in the field.",,American Petroleum Institute

Steel Corp.),,,,,,API-57-130,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"An external-upset threaded-and-coupled tubing joint has been developed for high-pressure gas service. The API round-form thread is used and the joint is applied on the regular upset ends. Specific features of the design are the use of closer thread tolerances than API, longer thread length than the API joint, and the use of a heavy tin plating on the coupling threads. Joints have been developed for 2 3/8-in. OD and 2 7/8-in. OD tubing. Tests have shown the performance of the joint design to be as follows:Using a relatively low power makeup (900 ft-lb), the joint is leak-tight with an internal nitrogen gas pressure of 15,000 psi and 100 temperature cycles between 60 F. and 200 F.The joint is capable of withstanding 12 repeated makeups and breaks at constant make-up torque (which is sufficient for a leak-tight joint) without thread damage, and is gas-leak-tight after the 13th makeup.The power makeup required for a leak-tight joint is 2 1/4 turns or 900 ft-lb of torque for both the 2 3/8 in. and 2 7/8-in. tubing joints. This torque is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the torque required for a comparable joint using zincplated coupling threads.The 2 3/8-in. tubing joint can be made with a reduced coupling diameter of 2.910-in. without changing the torque required for a gas-leak-tight joint and can be made up repeatedly. In this case the coupling is made of the next higher grade of steel than the tubing.The tensile strength of the joint is not altered by the use of the low-friction tin on the coupling threads.INTRODUCTIONThe very high pressures presently encountered in some oil wells may exceed the capacity of the present API external-upset tubing joint. The dimensions of this joint were established many years ago when a pressure of 3,500 psi was considered high. Today pressures well over 10,000 psi are encountered, and in wells more than 15,000ft in depth. High-strength steel and high-strength joints are required to support the long strings of tubing and the joints must resist leakage at high pressures and be capable of repeated makeup.The API external-upset tubing joint has established an excellent record in many thousands of wells over a long period of years and is still entirely satisfactory for the service conditions for which it was intended. This is demonstrated by the fact that no serious attempt has been made to improve it until now, and the development of high-pressure joints has proceeded along other lines.Because the API tubing joint has been so successfully used for the service conditions normally encountered, it appeared reasonable to attempt to develop it further for the more severe service conditions before abandoning it in favor of an entirely different approach. Starting with the API external-upset tubing joint, high-pressure tubing joints have been developed for 2 3/8-in. OD and 2 7/8 in. OD tubing. Also, a special-clearance high-pressure external-upset tubing joint for 2 3/8-in. OD tubing was developed for applications where hole clearance is a problem.",,American Petroleum Institute

Wakefield Jr.(Richfield Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-57-151,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"Injection operations carried out in thick reservoir sections have the attendant problem of control of injected fluid within the section. A method of reducing this problem is to bond the injection well liner to the shale fingers and to the sandstone shells that are usually present in the sand section and to install a packer in the blank liner opposite each break in the sand section.Gas injection has been carried out in as many as three intervals simultaneously by the use of multiple packers and concentric tubing strings. This method has the advantage of a continuous surface record of the volumes of fluid injected into each interval.Water injection has been carried out simultaneously in as many as 8 intervals by the use of 9 packers with an injection mandrel located between each packer. Reasonably close approximation of the rate of injection into each interval can be determined through the use of a spinner survey of the surface recording type.Both methods of selective injection of fluid by the use of multiple packers offer a method of minimizing fluid bypassing in thick reservoir sections without incurring the expense of drilling additional conventionally equipped injection wells.INTRODUCTIONInjection of gas, and more recently water, into reservoirs for pressure maintenance has the attendant problem to a greater or lesser extent of bypassing. This bypassing phenomena is especially harmful in California operations where the reservoir sands have thicknesses commonly measured in hundreds of feet. The injection of water into California reservoirs for secondary recovery makes it mandatory that all possible control of the entry of water into the reservoir sands be obtained.One approach to this control problem is the use of multiple packers in a well bore in order to obtain selective injection. This selective injection is based upon the employment of correlative shale or sandstone shell stringers which, in many reservoirs, tend to divide the reservoir sand or zone into subzones or intervals. A well drilled for the use of multiple packers would thus usually have a solid cemented liner installed with gun perforations into the subzones preserving blank sections of appropriate length across the correlative shale or sandstone shell markers. The multiple packers would be installed in the blank sections of the gun-perforated liner. Where oil wells were to be converted to injection operations, the slotted liners have been pulled and solidly cemented gun-perforated liners have been installed. In the situations where the number of intervals in which injection was desired was small, cement scabs have been installed in the slotted liner opposite the correlative shale bodies.In some instances, it has been possible to inject gas into an upper subzone where gas-cap sands exist and produce the lower subzones, gas lifting if necessary, thereby saving the cost of drilling a well. In other instances, it has been possible to carry out controlled rate water injection into as many as 8 intervals simultaneously, thereby again saving the cost of drilling additional injection wells.",,American Petroleum Institute

Agnew(Humble Oil Refining Company),,,,,,API-57-161,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"The dynamometer has been found to be a valuable tool when used in a planned well-analysis program designed to reduce lifting costs; prevent equipment failures; reduce the loss of production resulting from downtime; improve the design, selection, and application of equipment; improve production practices; and increase production. The manner in which the dynamometer is applied in such a program is discussed.A new application for the dynamometer is that of determining the net lift and pumping bottom-hole pressure. This method has not been developed into a standard recommended practice because of its limited use; however, it does have sufficient merit to deserve further investigation and is presented with that thought in mind.Example applications of the dynamometer are given which show how this tool can be used in a program which has the goal of producing each well in a manner that will result in the greatest overall return on the investment.INTRODUCTIONThe science of producing oil can be broken down into three distinct but interrelated phases. Basically, these phases are:1,the flow of oil through the reservoir and into the well bore;2,the flow or lift of oil from the well bore to the surface facilities; and3,the treatment and preparation of oil into a merchantable product. Today, with oil being produced from increasing depths, and the cost of labor and materials continuing to rise, it is essential that maximum efficiency be obtained in each of these phases. This requires the full utilization of personnel, equipment, and technical advances. In working toward this goal it has been found that information obtained with a dynamometer can be of great value when dealing with the second phase of oil production. The significance of the lifting phase becomes more apparent when it is realized that operating expenses during the life of a predominately artificial-lifted field will approximately equal the drilling and completion costs. It is the purpose of this paper to present a few of the practical applications of the dynamometer which illustrate its place in reducing operating costs.ApplicationIn using the dynamometer, it should be realized that it is not an instrument into which data can be fed on one side and the written answer received on the other. The dynamometer is nothing more than a rod weight indicator which records load plotted against polished-rod position. Often we can determine very little from this information alone. Therefore, in order to obtain the maximum benefits, it should be used in conjunction with other production tools in a well-organized and systematic plan for well analysis. The goal for such a program is to obtain maximum production a t a minimum cost throughout the life of a pumping well. In doing this it should be understood that the operation of a pumping well, simple as it may seem, is in reality rather complex. To fully understand these problems, it is essential that the many and varied factors that affect a sucker-rod pumping system be viewed as a complete picture.",,American Petroleum Institute

Doscher(Shell Development Co.)|Leon Weber(Gulf Research Development Corp.),,,,,,API-57-169,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"The need for a quality test for subsurface injection water is developed with particular reference to the wide range in the injection rates being attained in some 200 water floods surveyed by the Study Committee on Water Treatment of the Southern District of the American Petroleum Institute.Filtration of injection water through membrane filters has been chosen as a test procedure which yields information on the plugging tendency of the water and which facilitates identification of the solids responsible for the plugging of porous media.The results of this test cannot be directly converted to an injection rate into a subsurface formation. It is primarily intended to serve as a procedure for policing the quality of the water during the life of the flood and to permit the engineer to determine whether the component parts of either an experimental pilot or full-scale treating plant are operating effectively. The use of the test in several field projects is described.INTRODUCTIONOne of the most important factors affecting the success of a secondary recovery by water-flooding project is the ease with which water can be injected into the formation. Low wellhead pressures and infrequent mechanical and chemical clean-out operations obviously lead to low operating costs. Maintaining uniform encroachment from the injection we1l.s into the producing wells, which is believed to be a requisite for obtaining a high recovery of oil, is also dependent upon being able to inject the assigned amount of water into each injection well.A survey of operating practices in water-flooding operations, conducted by the Study Committee on Water Treatment of the Southern District of the API between 1953 and 1956, revealed a wide distribution in the injection rates which were being attained in the industry. (See Fig. 1, 2, and 3 and Appendix A.)In addition to the injection data, the cooperating operators completed questionnaires in which they were requested to describe the source of the injection water, the manner in which it was treated, the location of the flood, the character (depth, permeability, etc.) of the formation, the age of the flood, the occurrence of operating troubles, and remedial measures that had been undertaken. Of the original group of 169 responses, 40 percent reported operating troubles. A follow-up survey a year later, which was answered by 140 of the original group, revealed that the percentage of those operations in which operating troubles were being encountered had jumped to 65 percent. Half of these pointed out corrosion as the operating trouble, and the other half associated the operating trouble with solids (scale, bacteria, paraffin, etc.) in the injection water or a decline in injection rates.It was impossible to detect any positive correlation between the reporting of operating troubles and the injectivity indexes with the nature or source of the injection water, the character of the formation, the size or age of the flood, the method of treating the water, etc.",,American Petroleum Institute

Faulk(The Atlantic Refining Co.),,,,,,API-57-180,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"Recent improvements in well-completion techniques have reduced the rig time required to prepare for drilling- out or completion operations after the casing has been cemented. The full extent of this time saving cannot be realized, however, unless the time customarily allowed for the cement to set and gain strength can be reduced.A study was undertaken to determine if current cement waiting times could be reduced safely. This study together with some experimental field evidence indicates the present waiting-on-cement intervals can be substantially reduced without adversely affecting well operations.INTRODUCTIONEarly-day operators reportedly waited as long as 7 days for cement to attain strength. For many years this waiting period was 3 days. Although practices vary to some degree, 24 hours seems to be the most popular waiting period at this time. Cement quality control, improvements In casing-cement methods, technological improvements in drilling and completing wells, and progressive experimentation with cement waiting periods have all contributed to this change in practice. The saving in well cost resulting from these past reductions in cement waiting times has enabled the industry to drill a large number of additional wells. The cost reduction also, in effect, has added to the recoverable reserves by making certain marginal reservoirs economically exploitable.The term, waiting on cement, hereinafter referred to as WOC, usually refers to the period beginning when cement is placed and ending when further work is started toward completion of the well. Thus, on surface pipe, WOC starts when the plug is down with cement in place around the casing and ends when drilling out of the plug is started. On production casing, if the drilling rig is used In completing the well, the WOC interval begins when the cement is placed and ends when the well is or when drilling out begins.Recent improvements in completion practices have served to further reduce the time required, after casing has been cemented, to prepare for drilling out or completion operations. In fact, in most instances a well can be ready for perforating in considera1ly less time than the 24 hours customarily called for.With the possibility of further monetary savings a s an incentive, a study was undertaken to determine if present WOC intervals could be reduced safely. The study consisted primarily of comparing cement-strength requirements and experimental cement-strength data to arrive at a minimum safe WOC interval. At the same time, progressive experimentation was carried out in the field on a limited scale. This paper covers the results of this study. Official state regulations covering WOC intervals are reviewed briefly also, to show their impact on field practices.DISCUSSIONCement Strength RequirementsBefore the question, have WOC practices kept pace with technology,? could be answered, it was necessary to determine from an engineering standpoint how much waiting-on-cement time is actually needed for oil-well cements to attain sufficient strength to perform their function.",,American Petroleum Institute

It has become a valuable and versatile tool i11 the hands of the competent field-mud engineer. With it he can salvage barite and reject harmful light native solids. This makes it possible to reduce additions of water and chemicals, to eliminate contaminants, and to produce an effective packer mild.Management approves because well costs are reduced. Drilling engineers find that penetration rates are increased and hole troubles reduced. Drilling crews are relieved from the work and hazard of adding large amounts of barite and massive chemical treatments to the mud.INTRODUCTIONThe centrifugal treatment of weighted drilling muds is becoming increasingly prominent in today's drilling operations. It is fast becoming recognized as the key tool which allows the mud engineer to prepare and maintain the low-solids muds needed to drill modern, deep, high-pressure wells wit11 some semblance of economy. Its efficiency as a solids remover has been known for some time. Now, its versatility as a mud-engineering tool is being exploited.The greatest value of centrifuging as a mud-engineering tool is based on the problems of maintaining weighted muds. Even when no difficulties are being experienced, the normal maintenance of high-density mud 1s very costly. Watering back such a mud has been an accepted procedure because the fine formation particles which are not removed by the shale-shaker screen or by settling in the tanks become a part of the mud.The presence of these fine, lightweight formation particles affects the mud adversely in that they occupy space. The volume of the liquid phase is reduced when these additional solids are present. The character of these solids can be altered by chemical treatment so that more of then1 can be tolerated before a mud loses its desired properties, but eventually their concentration in the mud must be reduced. The practice of watering back, therefore, has been necessary to maintain the mud in its normal range of properties. In high-density muds the problem is intensified by the presence of large amounts of barite, which is the most expensive component of the mud.The amount of water which is added to the mud at any given time depends upon the condition of the mud. The addition of 10 percent to the volume 1s common, and sometimes it is necessary to add 20-percent water to get a mud into proper condition. This is in addition to the normal amount of water which is always going Into the mud while drilling is in progress.COST OF DILUTING A MUDRemembering that when a certain, volume of water is added to the system, room must be made for that water, we ,should first look a t the economic factors involved in watering back a mud.

At the same time, operators are faced with the problem of higher pressure gradients. These factors suggest that a constantly greater proportion of oil-country tubular goods of high-strength properties will be required. Designs of hypothetical casing strings, based upon expectations of depths to 25,000 ft. indicate that strengths as high as 170,000 psi may be needed to develop such wells. Investigation has shown that strength levels of this order may be achieved and that reasonable ductility may be maintained by using the quench and temper method of heat treating. Moreover, by this process, it has been shown that N-80 and P-110 grades of superior toughness and ductility can be produced.INTRODUCTIONIt is a matter of record that the oil industry, in the years since World War 11, has demonstrated repeatedly a remarkable capability for satisfying the nation's constantly increasing demands for petroleum and its derivatives. Although all phases of the industry share in this accomplishment, a glance a t the published statistics will show that a major portion of this achievement can he credited to the 45-percent increase in crude-oil production which was recorded in the decade 1945-1955.lIt is interesting to note that the rising level of crude production during this 10-year period was accomplished by an increase of nearly 110 percent in the number of wells drilled and, at the same time, an increase of almost 145 percent in the amount of footage drilled.lThese figures indicate that while crude production rose quite sharply, drilling rates increased even more rapidly and at constantly greater average depths. As an extreme example of this trend to deeper wells, we recall that the record depth in the year 1945 was 16,655 ft, whereas the current record stands at 22,570 ft.lBarring some unforseen series of circumstances, it is believed that these trends will continue. Various estimates with respect to future drilling activity have been developed; but almost universally, all infer that to sustain the rising demand, a greater and greater number of wells must be drilled with a larger and larger proportion completed in the lower zones.These facts are of greatest significance to that segment of the steel industry responsible for furnishing the oil-country tubular goods required to support this activity. The pipe manufacturer, in planning his future production patterns, cannot overlook those factors which govern, more and more, the quantity and quality of the tubular products he will manufacture. Three factors of particular influence in this respect are:The year-by-year increase in the number of wells drilled.The constantly increasing depths of penetration.The occurrence of high bottom-hole and surface pressures.One of the greatest deterrents in designing a successful program for deep drilling is the lack of adequate tubular goods.",,American Petroleum Institute

But there were certain restrictions on this power because . . . all duties, imposts and excises shall he uniform throughout the United States . . . and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective members . . . Under this power the Federal Government financed itself for some 126 years, or until 1913 when the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted and which provided: The Congress shall have the right to lay and collect taxes on income, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the states, and without regard' to any census or enumeration. It logically follows that the new power gained by Congress applied solely and only to income taxes, but all other taxes must necessarily be imposed under the original Constitution provision. and must partake of certain definite characteristics involving uniformity and apportionment. Possibly no one would dispute the fact that the income tax is an impost, certainly it is an imposition; and, being a direct tax,lwould have to be apportioned among the several states were it not for the specific language of the Sixteenth Amendment.The opinions of tile Supreme Court hold that Congress always had the right to impose income taxes which Congress repeatedly did prior to 1913 although such taxes were not apportioned. Some of such laws, ruled to be constitutional a t the time were found years later to be unconstitutional for various reasons including the failure to apportion among the states.For nearly 50 years prior to 1913, the taxpayer was subjected to direct income levies without apportionment under as palatable flavors as possible but disguised under completely false colors. Thus, during and after the Civil War, unapportioned income taxes were directly imposed upon the people, irrespective of, the constitutional provision to the contrary.By means of these laws and during the emergency, which might have been a justification therefor, some $375,000,000 of revenue was obtained which proved to be approximately one-ninth of the total internal revenue of the period. In addition, some $20,000,000 was raised by direct taxes upon property, including real estate. Of course, a tax of $400,000,000 during the Civil War would, in view of the interim devaluation of the dollar, be equivalent today to some billions of tax revenue.Neither in the Constitution nor in the Sixteenth.

Texas),,,,,,API-57-225,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1957,"In 1955, the API Southwestern District Study Committee on Casing Landing Practices recommended that special consideration be given to landing of casing in wells where design factors are low, where extreme pressures are encountered, where excessive mud weights are necessary or where other unusual circumstances exist. In this paper equations and nomographs are provided for use in arriving at sound landing procedures for these unusual wells, and for evaluating landing procedures now in effect for other wells. It is concluded that landing methods should reflect proper consideration of both the buckling and the wellhead-load characteristics of the string. An example problem is included to illustrate application of the equations and nomographs.INTRODUCTIONIn March 1955, the API Southwestern District Study Committee on Casing Landing Practices reported on their review of approximately 3,700 wells drilled in 1952 by 21 operators in the Southwestern District.lThese wells ranged in depth from 2,000 ft. to 14,000 ft. with an average depth of 8,000 ft. The casings in these wells were landed by one of four methods:1,as cemented;2,in tension at the freeze point;3,neutral at the freeze point; or4,in compression at the freeze point. In view of the wide difference in methods of landing casing under similar conditions, the study committee recommended a landing practice which they believed . . . should afford the greatest amount of protection for and service from API casing in a very high percentage of wells drilled in the Southwestern United States. The study committee recommended that casing be landed as cemented in all wells where mud weights do not exceed 12.5 lb per gal, where standard design factors are used, and where the wellhead equipment and outer casing string are of sufficient strength to withstand the landing loads. The term as cemented means that the casing is landed in approximately the same position in which it was hanging when the cement set. The only movement of the casing would be that necessary to transfer the weight to the casing hanger.In wells where design factors are low, where extreme pressures are encountered, where excessive mud weights are necessary, or where other unusual circumstances exist, the study committee recommended the landing practice be based on theoretical considerations developed by Lubinski . Lubinski's theoretical analysis yields means for determining if casing is buckled or has a tendency to buckle under down-the-hole conditions. By proper selection of landing procedure, Lubinski showed that buckling could be prevented.It has been recognized that a landing procedure based only on buckling considerations may result in undesirable axial loading. For example, if the hanging method calls for casing to be picked up a considerable amount from the as-cemented position, then large temperature drops in the free casing subsequent to hanging could produce additional tensile loading sufficient to cause tensile failure.

Acceptance of this new tool by the industry has made it possible for a large number of tests to be made. Developments in the tool and in interpretation of data have resultedLarger samples are now obtained by introduction of larger reservoirs. Pressure measurements are improved. Shaped charges and a snorkel device appear to improve performance under some conditions.Interpretations made from the formation tester are straightforward and simple. A study of many tests indicates that the amount of gas recovered is an excellent indicator of productive possibilities. An experience chart based on this factor has been prepared.INTRODUCTIONThe formation tester operated on logging cable has become firmly established as a practical method of evaluating production possibilities in the Texas Gulf Coast area. The method is now backed by 2% years of commercial use covering thousands of operations in this area.For those not already acquainted with the tester, its components are pictured in Fig. 1, together with a tabulation of its physical dimensions. A schematic diagram of the tool is shown in Fig. 2. In operation the tool is set with reference to logging measurements at any depth desired. The operating cycle and reservoir-pressure data are continuously recorded a t the surface during the test.A paper presented in the fall of 1956 on this new formation-testing method$ dealt in detail with the mechanical and operating aspects of the tool and presented the typical pressure recordings which, for convenience, are repeated in this paper. The purpose here is to give a progress report on the application of the tool and a further approach to interpretation of test results in the Texas Gulf Coast area.New DevelopmentsSince the introduction of the first tools into the field, reservoirs of 2.75 and 5.5 gal have been put into use in addition to the 1-gal reservoir provided in the original tool. These reservoirs, by obtaining larger samples, were designed to reduce the percentage of mud filtrate recovered. The problem of mud-filtrate contamination is especially critical in formations of low permeabilities and porosites, which are generally most deeply invaded. However, the low sampling pressures usually encountered in these formations require that the tool be open a longer time in order to fill the larger reservoirs. A completely filled 1,eservoir enables superior interpretations. Because the time that the tool must remain in position to fill the 5.5-gal reservoir sometimes exceeds the limit considered safe for Gulf Coast wells, the 2.75- gal tool has become most widely used in this area. It gives sufficient recovery for proper interpretation on a high percentage of tests and has the obvious safety advantages of smaller-diameter and lighter tools.A segregating device is installed in each of the 2.75-gal and 5.5-gal testers.Fig. 1 -Formation TesterFrom Lebourg, Fields, and Doh (Available in full paper)Fig. 2-Schematic Diagram of Formation TesterFrom Lebourg, Fields, and Doh (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

This program was a combination of laboratory research as well as controlled field applications To hasten the development, a small rig was acquired and several relatively shallow wells were air drilled to field test laboratory materials The requirements for such materials are described as well as techniques that have been developed to correctly place the materials.

Experimental data on the embedment of steel spheres into formation core samples support the proposed equations. The laboratory equipment and technique are described. In addition, the effects of size and concentration of the propping sand, overburden pressure, and fluid leak-off on the width of sand-propped fractures are discussed.INTRODUCTIONProduction data on wells in some formations indicate that well stimulation has not been obtained with hydraulic fracturing. In analyzing the treatment data on a number of unsuccessful cases, it was decided that the most likely cause of the failure was in the propping of the fracture. It is accepted that the primary purpose of the propping sand is to maintain a fracture in an open position while supporting the weight of the overburden. Should there be an insufficient amount of propping sand in the fracture and/or the formation offer very little resistance to the sand embedment, the fracture would close. Should the fracture close, little stimulation would result from the well treatment.The embedment of the propping sand into the formation forms the basis of this paper. It is the purpose of the paper to show that the size and concentration of the propping sand, overburden pressure, and certain formation characteristics control the width of the propped fracture. Whereas it is recognized that assumptions are necessary in translating laboratory data into field operations, it is believed that this paper provides a practical method of determining the propping-sand requirements in formations in which the sand embeds.THEORY AND RELATED STUDIESAs the overburden load supported by a grain of propping sand in a fracture becomes excessive, the sand grain will react in one of two ways. The grain will either crush or it will completely embed in the formation. These two conditions are exemplified in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively. This paper is concerned with the type of formation shown in- Fig. 2 in which total embedment is possible under excessive overburden load.In the propping-agent embedment studies of Dehlinger et al..1it was assumed that the load-carrying capacity of a spherical propping agent in a fracture was a function of the compressive strength of the formation and the total contact area between the propping agent and the formation. This can be expressed as: L = a ScBy assuming that the grains of the propping sand were spherical, uniform in size, rigid, and distributed uniformly in the fracture, and that the fracture to be propped was horizontal, these authors derived an equation for the width of a propped fracture, which is:References are at the end of the paper-.Fig. 1-The Crushing of 12-mesh Ottawa Sand Under 1,500 Psi Overburden Pressure (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

The group was formed to jointly explore the California submerged lands.Early exploratory efforts were principally geophysical. This was followed by taking surface soil samples and finally near-surface cores. The techniques of taking surface cores with a dart and with the use of the jetting tool were developed by the group. Some cores were taken using drill pipe. In this case the pipe was rotated and salt water was used as a jetting fluid.The complexity of California geology made it more and more apparent that a better exploratory tool was needed. The desire to acquire geological information at greater depths led to thinking of ways or means that might permit the application of conventional drilling practices. A new method of drilling was designed which permitted drilling from a floating vessel incorporating the normal drilling practice of return circulation, the use of blowout-prevention equipment, and hole re-entry.HISTORYThe first floating drilling experiments were performed in 1953. The M. V. Submarex (Fig. l), a 300-ton ex-Navy patrol craft, was equipped with a small drilling rig and experiments were performed to develop a method of drilling from the vessel. By 1954, the art of this type of drilling, which incorporated the features of hole re-entry - return circulation - and blowout prevention, was reduced to a practical exploratory method. Several hundred thousand feet of core holes have since been drilled in submerged lands in water depths ranging from 30ft to 400 ft. Experience thus acquired led ultimately to the design and construction of a much larger tool of this type, viz., the drilling barge CUSS I.Engineering on the CUSS I started early in 1955 and culminated with its eventual completion in late 1956. It has successfully drilled in 50 to 350ft of water to depths ranging from 3,000ft to 6,000 ft., performing all the usual operations undertaken in a drilling well such as coring, fishing, and electric logging, including continuous dipmeter and sidewall sampling.Fig. 1-The M.

Empirical relationships are developed to show the Influence on penetration rate of weight on bit, rotary speed, and hydraulic horsepower. Optimum weight on bit is shown In relation to formation driliability and optimum rotary speed is related to weight on bit These five relationships are then combined into a chart for determining optimum drilling techniques from a minimum of field test data.Secondary Issues discussed are:1, advantages of the jet bit over the regular bit and minimum nozzle fluid velocity requirements for jet-bit use relative to formation driliability ; and2, distribution of pump horsepower Into nozzle fluid velocity and circulating volume.INTRODUCTIONThe wide variations in drilling conditions encountered in oil-field work make it difficult o develop general rules of operation for obtaining maximum drilling efficiency Field experience and test data usually provide the basis for operations In a particular locale, but testing often is too costly and experience too late Consequently, a method for determining optimum drilling techniques for any particular drilling condition, with a minimum of engineering effort and drilling experience, is greatly neededTo assist in developing such a method is the purpose of this report It is recognized that sufficient drilling information has not been accumulated to accomplish this ambitious job without some shortcomings along the way It is believed, however, that the method proposed is flexible to improvements which are sure to be made, and that ultimately the purpose of the report will be accomplished more comprehensively through a combined effort of interested partiesCONTROI.LABLE FACTORS THAT AFFECT BIT PERFORMANCEDrill-bit performance depends primarily upon the five controllable factors1, weight on bit ,2, rate of rotation,3, hydraulic horsepower,4, type of bit, and5, properties of the circulating medium Although each parameter contributes individually to, bit performance, they are closely interrelated and their combined influence governs the degree of drilling efficiency obtained The Influences of circulating media have been covered In literature and will not be discussed herein This report will deal primarily with weight on bit, rotary speed, hydraulic horsepower, and the relative performance of jet and regular bits In particular, an attempt will be made to find answers for the followingHow penetration rate of a bit varies with weight on bit, rate of rotation ,and hydraulic horsepowerTo what upper limits these parameters can be carried economicallyThe interrelation of these three parameters in various formations, and the combinations which result In minimum drilling costsMerits of various types of bits There are, of course, many factors other than the five discussed here that affect drilling efficiency and footage costs These Include formation hardness, abrasiveness of formation well depth, and many others As these items cannot be conveniently controlled, them influence. on costs must simply be accepted",,American Petroleum Institute

Lummus(Pan American Petroleum Corp),,,,,,API-59-017,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1959,"Research on the effect of colloidal materials on the filtration properties of clear water and brine has led to the development of agents which are effective in minute quantities as fluid-loss-reducing agents for drilling and workover fluids. These agents are used in concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 percent by weight (approximately 0.15 to 0.5 lb per bbl). They are effective over a wide range of permeability, in the presence or absence of oil saturation, in either clay-containing or clay-free formations, and do not significantly affect productivity.The materials were evaluated as fluid-loss reducers using sandstone discs rather than filter paper, because filtration rates obtained using paper were found to be unrealistic when testing water which contains little solids material. A vegetable gum compound and a mixture of starch and bentonite were found to be the most effective additives. Successful field applications of these materials as additives for workover and completion fluids are described.INTRODUCTIONIn planning the drilling, completion, or workover of a well, the selection of the fluid to be used is of major importance. The fluid should have a low filtrate loss to avoid forming a thick mud filter cake on the wall of the hole and to minimize flushing of productive zones. In wells where a high-density fluid is not required, clear water offers advantages over conventional mud as a drilling fluid because it gives faster penetration rates, greater footage per bit, anti lower costs. It has been found that use of a clear brine as a completion or workover fluid results in faster and cleaner repair jobs than does mud.The disadvantages of using clear water or brine systems for drilling or workover is that fluid loss is often excessive. It is sometimes difficult even to maintain circulation when fluid loss is extremely high. Difficulty is encountered in circulating sand and debris from wells when fluid loss is excessive and the danger of sticking tools exists.In view of the possible benefits that can be obtained through use of clear fresh water or brine as a drilling, completion, or workover fluid, tests were conducted to develop agents for reducing the filtrate loss of clear-water systems.PROCEDURELaboratoryConventional permeability tests were conducted to compare the flow rates of untreated and treated water through sandstone cores and to find the effects of the waters on oil permeability. The cores were 1 in. long and 0.75 in. in diameter. The liquids were flowed at a pressure of 50 psi across the cores to minimize relative permeability end effects. Oil was flowed in the direction opposite to which water was introduced to simulate production of oil from a formation. The fluids were in laminar flow.In a different series of experiments, tests similar to API mud filtration tests11,2were conducted using sandstone discs as septa rather than filter paper. The reason for using sandstone discs is discussed in a later section. A Baroid Model 380 high-temperature - high-pressure mud filter press was modified to accept the discs by scoring",,American Petroleum Institute

Therefore, special preventive measures should be deferred until justified Automatic controls have the same application in water flooding as in any other producing operation The application of various measures to effect economy In the development and operation of a water-flood project can be determined only by a detailed cost analysisINTRODUCTIONWater injection is being practiced today on oil properties that were initially developed as long as 80 years ago and as recently as the last 10 years. Well depths range from less than 500 ft. to more than 10,000 ft.; and well spacing from 2 &frac12; acres to as much as 80 acres. Individual producing-well capacities vary from a few barrels per day to more than 500 bbl per day Various water-input and producing-well arrangements have been used, ranging from injection of water into a few edge wells simulating a natural water drive to an intensive 5-spot pattern injection using 1 water-injection well to each producing well. All of these operations are classified under the general heading of water flooding .No specific set of recommendations can be advanced that will be cost-reducing In the development and operation of all water floods. This paper considers areas where economies may be effected, but each individual project will require individual analysis to determine the most profitable approachThis subject has become of increasing importancebecause of the fact that the better-quality properties have been exploited and only those projects of lesser quality remain.Well Spacing and Pattern ArrangementOften one of the major items of cost m the development of a pattern-type water flood comes from the Drilling of infill wells to complete the pattern or Establish a well spacing for water flooding less than was required for primary production. The necessity for fill wells 1s often justified on the ham of establishing a uniform pattern on the surface n the to prevent tiapping of oil. A uniform surface well arrangement is unlike to encounter the same uniform sand conditions In the reservoir.When the water injection process was introduced into the Mid-Continent area, principally in the 500 ft. to 800 ft.

This is caused primarily by corrosion occurring over the prolonged producing life resulting from proration and the increasing use of secondary-recovery methods1.Methods commonly used to make casing repairs include cement squeeze, or cementing a liner through the damage zone When the damage is extensive, straddle packers on the tubing may be used to isolate the leaking area or the casing may be cut at some lower depth, pulled, and replaced with new pipe. A review of the failure frequency and the cost of these methods indicated the need for a new and more positive casing-repair method.An investigation of various types of materials and methods of repair was made. The outcome of this work was the development of a new method utilizing an inflatable rubber mandrel and a plastic-impregnated glass-fabric lamina The high strength of this material plus the fact that it can be pressure molded to fit complex shapes made it appear deal for this application Laboratory investigations were then made to determine the strength of this material in the presence of well fluids, the sizes of holes which could be repaired, the effect of well temperature and fluids on the cure time and strength of various plastic systems, and to devise methods of forming and placing a glass fabric-plastic patch over subsurface holes in well casing This paper deals primarily with the developed tool and the method for forming the glass fabric-plastic lamiae in the casing and the results of the several field applications The details of the laboratory investigation of materials used in forming a plastic line in well casing ale included in the appendix.EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDUREDescription of the Casing-repair ToolThe equipment used to make the plastic casing repair is shown schematically in Fig 1 and consists of four units - an expandable mandrel , centralizers, adjustable back-pressure valve, and tubing dump valve",,American Petroleum Institute

The three wells experienced almost every known drilling problem In spite of these problems the muds did a good job. It is behaved that a discussion from the mud standpoint will show the drilling industry what is expected of a mud in the deep wells of the fast-approaching futureINTRODUCTIONA study of the drilling history of three wells drilled by Phillips Petroleum Company m Pecos County shows that the only features they had in common were that they were all deep and they were all in Pecos County Further efforts to compare these wells become difficult, because they were all so different. The blowout on the Harial A No. 1 would have been more typical if the well had been on the Gulf Coast The high temperatures encountered in the Montgomery would be expected in Louisiana.Basically, the drilling mud were designed and main-tamed as low-solids muds Driscose was the primary mud material in all three wells. All variations of the daily mud treatments were based on the premise that the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose would permit a mud to remain fluid and keep good flow properties in wells that were hot and deep this premise was borne out, and it is apparent that the oil industry does have a drilling fluid for deep wellsGeneralMechanical devices played an important part in keeping the muds in good condition De-gassers were necessary for gas removal A cyclone-type separator was used on each of the wells to remove the formation solids.One of the most unheralded practices for keeping a mud system clean of formation solids is the practice of cross-over jetting. Jetting good mud away is an accepted practice, because the pits , or tanks, fill up with settings and loom must be made for new water it is difficult to estimate how much money is jetted away as good mud during the course of drilling a well. It is also impossible to guess how much money Phillips saved for mud materials on the three Pecos County wells by using crossover jets. This practice consists of an efficient system of cross-over jets whereby the tank settlings can be removed without letting away the valuable mud The mechanics of removing the formation solids are fairly simple, but it is necessary to adhere to some specific procedure For high efficiency there must be a surface-pit system large enough to prevent turbulence within the pits and a very efficient means of removing the settled solids without excessive loss of mud. It is necessary to use pits with jets to transfer the solids to the reserve pit",,American Petroleum Institute

Experiences has indicated that at the majority of the corrosion is occurring from the surface pipe to a depth of 500 ft. Some leaks have occurred below this point , but the majority are above the 500-ft level. To date, there have been over 1,400 cumulative casing leaks m the field At a cost of $2,500 per leak, the corrosion has cost to date over 3 million dollars.The cause of corrosion is by, or a combination of, acidic waters , dissimilar soils, bacteria , and stray current. The most practical approach to prevent this corrosion is the application of cathodic protection . Because of the high-resistant soils encountered magnesium anodes are limited in application Therefore, the operations are presently installing rectifiers as the means of applying current to the casing Surface potentials and down-the-hole surveys have indicated that it will require 2 amp per well for protection. Most operators ale using multi-well installations, with two major companies using single-well application. Thereare over 450 wells being protected by cathodic protection at this time The cost of cathodic protection is approximately $300 per well initially, plus $18 per well yearly cost.Based on the presently installed rectifier systems, Cathodic protection has proved to be 50 to 100 percent effective on the leases where protection has been maintained . Although it is not economical to protect every well, leases experiencing large corrosion rates should be protected for economical production.INTRODUCTIONIn 1958, East Texas operators spent over a quarter million dollars repairing casing leaks There are over 19,500 oil wells In the East Texas Field Nearly every well will develop one or more external casing leaks during its productive life unless casing corrosion is controlled it is estimated that by the end of 1968 this annual expense will reach $400.000At the present time 3 4 billion barrels of oil have been produced from this field and another 2 billion barrels will be produced before the field is abandoned To produce this oil at the present schedule, wells will have to last for another 40 to 50 years Therefore, it is very important for the operators to keep their well casing intact during the productive lifeEffect of Casing CorrosionExternal casing corrosion is field-wide and is not confined to any certain area or leases However, records of casing leaks from major companies representing 65 percent of the total wells have indicated that the south end of the field has the highest cumulative leak rate - 165 leaks per 1,000 wells The extreme north end has the next highest rate of 83 leaks per 1,000 wellsSince 1932, there have been over 1,400 leaks, which means that for every 1,000 wells 69 have developed leaks These, plotted against the date of occurrence and projected for the next 10 years (Fig I), show that by the end of 1968",,American Petroleum Institute

The filtrate which invades permeable formations may seriously impair their permeabilityA large part of the present mud technology has been directed toward minimizing the deficiencies of freshwater; sodium-based mud systems by various chemical treatments. Although this is a highly developed art, there is no doubt that further improvements can be made On the other hand, it is likely that more worthwhile advances can be made through basic changes in the chemical nature of the system. A significant step was taken in this direction with the introduction of the so-called inhibited mudThe primary objective of an Inhibited mud is to -control the hydration of bentonitic clays Several mud systems of this type are in use at the present time; a majority of these contain soluble calcium In lime muds, the earliest of the inhibited types, both calcium concentration and high pH help to suppress the hydration of clays Calcium content of lime muds is normally In the range of 200 to 300 ppm1More recently. two other inhibited muds have been introduced In one of these, the pH is moderately high and the calcium concentration ranges from 500 to 800 ppm2The other utilizes a lower pH and gypsum to achieve a calcium concentration of up to 1,000 ppm3",,American Petroleum Institute

Although this need is generally recognized for injection wells, it is probably much more urgent in the case of flowing oil or gas wells, for it has been demonstiated that some wells completed over a long productive injection produce only from a very limited part of the interval open to the well boreTo meet the need for a reliable subsurface flowmeter,an instrument has been developed for the measurement of fluid flow-rate profiles in a well bole beneath the bottom of the tubing. The instrument is run through the tubing on a small single-conductor wile line which transmits to the surface a signal from a spinner-type flow detector. Incorporated in the instrument is a packer which may be inflated or deflated at will by actuation, from the surface, of a motor-driven pump m the instrument. The packer, inflated with well fluid, effects a complete seal In either 5 -in or 7-in casing so that the entire flow from beneath the packer is diverted through the flow detecting and measuring assembly.Use to date of the subsurface flowmeter has shown that it is capable of furnishing information of value both from the standpoint of analysis of reservoir performance and from the standpoint of well operation. It is anticipated that flow-rate profiles will become of Increasing importance in propel production practicesINTRODUCTIONIn the last decade there has been sporadic interest in determination of flow profiles in producing wells and of injectivity profiles in injection wells. That this interest has not been more sustained and mole intense is probably the result of two factors First, subsurface flowmeters devised and built In the past have often been wanting in reliability, field-worthiness, versatility, 01 ease of operation, so that subsurface-flow surveys have often been viewed as a last-resort measure Second, possibly because of spectacular results achieved in some flow surveys in wells which were troublesome from the production is it and point, there has been a tendency for many production men to associate subsurface-flow surveys only with problem wellsActually, it is likely that flow-profile measurements will find their greatest application in 'normal producing oil and gas wells, i e , those wells which , from the production standpoint , are not problem wells. This is predicated on the belief , first, that flow profiles can furnish valuable information to the reservoir engineer and to the production man who is charged with proper control of the reservoir; and, second, that subsurface-flow surveys can be made with sufficient reliability and ease to enable them to become routine measurementsIt was with the latter thought in mind that work was initiated some years ago on the development of a subsurface flowmeter.

Mcdonald(Gulf Research Development Co.),,,,,,API-59-120,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1959,"In formations of sufficient hardness to affect only point-to-point contact between the formation and the propping sand, the propping sand will often crush under the overburden load. A method is presented by which the limiting overburden can be determined for various propping sands. Data on other propping agents show that an agent which tends to pancake under the overburden load results in fractures of higher capacities than an agent which fractures. One material which has been used successfully in recent months is a graded, crushed walnut shell which has been rounded. The field techniques and results obtained with the walnut shells are discussed.INTRODUCTIONOne of the predominant factors controlling the success of a hydraulic-fracturing operation is the propping of the fracture. By and large, sand has been the universal fracture-propping agent for all formations, with only the size and concentration being changed in an attempt to improve the results of fracturing. For fracturing in some formations, these changes alone have been sufficient. However, in other formations it has become evident that other propping agents would produce better results. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the conditions under which sand is not a suitable propping agent and to present data on other materials that may be used.RELATED STUDIES AND THEORYAs the overburden load supported by a grain of propping sand in the fracture becomes excessive, the sand grain will either embed in the formation or crush. These conditions are exemplified in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively. In the study of Dehlinger, et al.1it was assumed that the load-carrying capacity, L, of a spherical grain of propping sand was a function of the compressive strength of the formation,S,, and the contact area,a, between the grain and the formation. This may be expressed as :Formula available in full paperIn this cited study for a given size and concentration of propping sand, it was shown that as the overburden pressure was increased, the fracture capacity became less. This condition resulted from a smaller fracture width which, in turn, resulted from the embedment of the propping sand in the formation. Whereas the embedment condition is the controlling factor in a number of formations, there are formations in which embedment is resisted to the extent that the propping sand is crushed.In a more recent study2it was shown that the propping sand could crush or embed, depending upon the formation. The approach to embedment in this study was analogous to a penetration-hardness test of metal, and a quantitative method was given by which the extent of embedment could be determined. The method was based on the relation that the ratio of the diameter of the impression, d, made by a grain of propping sand in the formation to the grain diameter, D, is a function of the ratio of the load, LFig. 1-The Embedment of 12-mesh Ottawa Sand under 1,500 Psi Overburden Pressure (Available in full paper)Fig. 2-The Crushing of 12-mesh Ottawa Sand under 1,500 Psi Overburden Pressure (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Interpretation of the results of tests made in Gulf Coast formations, as well as the mechanical and operating aspects of the tool have been presented in previous papers Although the Logging-cable Formation Tester was primarily designed to test unconsolidated or highly porous and permeable formations, it soon became apparent that it should also apply to the testing of consolidated formations In March 1957, the tool was introduced in the Mid-Continent Since that time, some 750 tests have been made testing virtually every type formation known to be productive The purpose of this paper is to discuss the application, results, and interpretations of tests made consolidated formationsMany field examples have established the agreement between interpretation results and pressure-buildup theory A number of examples are shownINTRODITCTIONRecent interpretation techniques for the Logging-cable Formation Tester have vastly improved reservoir and production determinations in low-permeability formations. These techniques are based upon considerations of gas solubility and pressure-buildup dataIn low-permeability zones mud-filtrate invasion is normally deep Test interpretations are further complicated by the relatively small fluid recoveries; full sample chambers are rarely achieved. Gas, in varying amounts, is generally recovered; and it has been difficult to know when the amount recovered constituted a positive show, indicating the possibility of production Consideration of the solubility of gas m water, coupled with accurate measurement of the amounts of gas and water recovered, permits valid interpretations based upon very small recoveries Improved recoveries have been obtained with deeper-penetrating shaped-charge sampling shotsValuable information on reservoir pressure and permeability can be obtained by plotting the pressure-buildup data from the formation-tester log For zones supplying a low rate of flow these data are obtained by closing the seal valve and recording pressure buildup in the small-volume flow tube These shut-in data are sufficient to obtain a curve which, when extrapolated, will give the undisturbed reservoir pressure. Inasmuch as only small quantities of fluid are withdrawn, the reservoir pressure is scarcely affected at a relatively small distance from the hole. Thus, in a very short time,the shut-in pressure approaches reservoir pressure. Numerous pressure vs. time points are available to accurately establish a pressure-buildup gradient This gradient allows the determination of a usable permeability range for the zone in question Permeability determination is based upon the formula proposed by D.

Reasons for this , of course, are inflationary cost trends of equipment and labor coupled with stringent and Increasing legislative controls covering gas markets and pricesWhere pressures and reserves are favorable, processing of this type well stream by auto-refrigeration accompanying pressure reduction is being applied more generally than ever before Until recently, it was usually conceded that in the 5 bbl per million and less category additional liquid recovery to be realized via the low-temperature route was not justified because of the greater investment for this type of equipment as compared to the line heater, scrubber, glycol-dehydrator combination . Of the many factors affecting justification of this type equipment on marginal well streams, one of the most important can be recovery or partla1 recovery and sale of flash vapors that would otherwise be vented to atmosphere and lostEXTENT OF THE DISCUSSIONBriefly stated and as we are most familiar with it, the field-applied low-temperature unit utilizes the Joule- Thompson effect in expanding a well stream at high pressure to achieve low separation temperatures. The high-pressure well stream is pre-cooled with the cold sales gas to achieve even colder separation temperatures and subsequent increased condensation of oil and water present oil the vapor phase Gas-saturated oil produced In the process is either stabilized or stage-separated prior to being sent to storage.A portion of the flash gas from the stabilization unitor stage separator may be used as pump power or fuel The remainder is either flared or recompressed to sales- gas pressure. Whatever is done with this residue tail gas involves an economic study of the factors involved, since , if flared, a direct loss in well-stream income results. or, if recompressed, the costs of operation and maintenance and initial investment of the compressor installation must be justified by the additional return realized. It is the conservation of these vapors and the reduction of vapor-compression costs by various process techniques that is dealt with in this discussionSix well streams of varying degrees of richness in recoverable stock-tank oil were studied in SIX separate process schemes.

A statistical summary of all work performed In California is given Field examples ale cited, and it is demonstrated that the method has resulted In wells with higher initial and ultimate production. Similarly, the application of gas-drilling procedures to workover of older wells is discussed and field examples are given To date washing and clean-out operations have been performed The possible use of gas-drilling equipment for formation fracturing, gravel packing, and improved washing is discussed.INTRODUCTIONThe producing segment?of the California oil industry has been focusing its interest over the past two and a half years on the use of air, natural gas, aerated and gasteated muds for completion drilling. To better understand the interest evoked and the reasons for the use of these fluids, it is well to examine some history.With the introduction of rotary drilling early in the century and it is subsequent wide adoption, less information on the formations being penetrated and their possible productivity became available to the operator. Coring, mud logging, formation testing, and electric logging overcame these deficiencies, but at an increase in drilling costsHowever, the most important disadvantage of the rotary system, particularly in low-pressure formations, has been the deleterious effect of the drilling mud on the producing zone To assure safe conduct of drilling operations, mud programs have been devised so that a greater pressure has been maintained at all time in the well bore than in the zones being penetrated This has resulted in a tendency for mud, solids, or filtrates to flow into the zone during the drilling. The damage to producing zones that can result from solids plugging or hydration of formation clays has been thoroughly discussed In the Industry literature1-S,inclAny reduction while drilling of the pressure gradient from the well bore to the formation should reduce the tendency for formation damage it is oil this basis that use of gaseated or aerated drilling fluids is thought to afford more effective completions.If the pressure gradient while drilling is reversed, so that a gradient exists from the formation to the well bore, and no materials foreign to the zone are introduced, an extremely effective completion on should be achieved. It is o n this basis that gas or air drilling is thought to afford a better completion procedure Almost every paper on the subject of air or gas drilling has speculated as to the favorable effects of applying these techniques to producing zones Lack of formation damage and reduced chance of passing over potentially productive zones have been cited as advantages However, there has been little application of the techniques to oil-producing zones, California operations being the exception.",,American Petroleum Institute

Present-day techniques are the result of extensive research and development to improve fracture efficiency and provide the maximum return to the well operator for his moneyMany of the important variables affecting fracturing treatments have remained undetermined so that in the past, most jobs were set up on a trial and error basis If a certain type of treatment worked well in a given field, other wells In the same area were similarly treated Many of these unanswered problems held the key to scientific preplanning of fracturing treatments on the basis of sound engineering principles. Some of these important questions are:What plane does the fracture pattern follow?What factors influence the use and efficiency of diverting gents?How much surface area and corresponding void are created during a fracturing treatment?What type of fracture conductivity can be expected following treatment?Can reservoir penetration be estimated usingexpected flow patterns?Can the multitude of fracturing fluids be evaluated against individual well conditions?Improved treatment efficiency can be expected if sound engineering principles are utilized to preplan fracturing treatments, instead of using trial-and-error methods Such factors as treatment size, technique, or type of fracturing materials necessary to produce best results should be carefully chosen on the basis of past experience and available formation data.

The results of laboratory tests and the successful performance of materials and equipment in the field clearly indicate that the deepest wells now being drilled can be successfully cemented.INTRODUCTIONDuring 1958 the Phillips Petroleum Company completed drilling operations on three deep wells In Pecos County, Texas All three wells were drilled below 19,000 ft. Two of the wells surpassed the depth record as it existed a t the beginning of 1958 When drilling operations were completed and production tests begun on the three wells, a cumulative total of 67,760ft of hole had been drilled, and 14 separate strings of casing, totaling 136,700 ft., had been set and cemented This accomplishment required the complete cooperation of Phillips Petroleum Company personnel with the many companies engaged to perform the various operations necessary to drill and complete these wells. Their report of the various cementing operations is typical of the engineering , planning, and cooperation between operator and service company that went into each phase of the drilling operationsDevelopment of the materials and equipment which made possible the successful cementing of these wells was begun several years ago. Consequently , the materials and techniques used were not experimental in any respect. This does not mean, however, that each individual job was not carefully engineered with respect to both materials and equipment The exact cement blends and cementing equipment to be used on each cement job were selected only after careful planning and study. The engineering that goes Into the cementing of a well is just as Important as the engineering performed during any other phase of the drilling or completion operation.MaterialsAlthough this paper is primarily concerned with the cement jobs performed on three particular wells, some of the general developments in the field of cement technology, as they pertain to oil-well cementing , should be discussed.The materials used in cementing operations can be divided into general classes, depending upon the function of the material Basically, the primary material is cement. Portland cement is the oldest and has been the most widely used type of cement Although one might assume that a material which has been used as long as portland cement could be altered very little in its properties, this is far from true. At the time when wells were no deeper than 5,000 or 6,000 ft., common portland or construction cement could be used for all cementing operations on these wells As wells were drilled deeper with accompanying increases in down-hole temperatures and pressures, it soon became apparent that common portland cement",,American Petroleum Institute

This can lead to a number of secondary problems such as contamination of freshwater supplies or loss of production Almost as Important is the corrosion of exposed pipe. Many times waters in areas where lost circulation is prevalent are corrosive Where the pipe has not been properly protected with cement, casing failures caused by corrosion become complex Occasionally, production from an upper zone becomes difficult because it has not been properly covered with cement and thus segregated from other zones.When an operator gets ready to cement a casing in place, he has some knowledge of whether the formation will support the cement-slurry column or whether he will encounter loss of circulation. With this information, gamed While drilling through the same zones, he should take the precautions necessary to prevent loss of circulating while cementing In order to combat lost circulation the operator must understand its various causes and the symptoms which indicate these causes.There are a number of causes of lost circulation. Frequently, a number of primary causes may be combined to give a rather complex picture of the trouble to be encountered. Partial loss of circulation may be experienced while drilling or cementing through a thief zone Here a part of the mud is lost to a porous formation . This may be the whole mud or just the fluid lost from the mud More serious than a thief zone are zones In which the formation is highly fractured Here the loss of circulation may be partial or complete When the fracture becomes sufficiently large to be considered cavernous or when actual caverns are drilled into, the loss of returns is complete and regaining these lost returns while drilling is almost impossible.At the time of cementing the most prevalent type of lost circulation is to a weak formation A weak formation is one where a small over-balance of formation pressure is sufficient to cause the formation to part and take fluid.",,American Petroleum Institute

A review of corrosion processes is presented before discussion of cathodic protection because the concepts of cathodic protection are intimately associated with the processes of corrosion Electron flow is used as the convention of current flow throughout the paper Electron flow is opposite to the direction of positive current flowCorrosionCorrosion in an electrolyte is an electrochemical process.Metal goes into solution at anode areas, and a current of electrons flows through the metal and is discharged at cathode areas The amount of current flowing is controlled by the relative areas of anodes and cathodes as well as the potentla1 differences existing between the anodes and cathodes. Potential differences may be caused by surface defects in the metal and/or differential environmental conditions such as variations in electrolyte concentration, pH, and dissolved oxygen content, to name a few.The corrosion of iron involves the solution of iron at anodic areas and deposition of hydrogen at the cathodic areas. The process goes on in such a way that the electrolyte remain electrically neutral; I e., an equivalent number of positive ions are displaced from the electrolyte for every iron. atom dissolved into the electrolyte. Typical iron corrosion reactions are shown in Fig 1Fig. 1 (Schremp)-Corrosion Reactions of Iron in an Electrolyte (Available in full paper)Hydrogen film formation is the primary cathode reaction And tends to limit the corrosion process in two ways1, by insulating the iron surface from the electrolyte, and2, by increasing the tendency for hydrogen to re-enter solution and thus oppose the tendency for iron to dissolve. Formation of a hydrogen film is called polarization and removal is called depolarization A hydrogen film usually is not sufficient to stop corrosion completely because the film may be damaged by the formation and release of hydrogen-gas bubbles or combination of hydrogen with dissolved oxygen. In either case, removal of the hydrogen film permits the corrosion process to continue. In acid solutions , the hydrogen film is destroyed mainly by the formation and release of hydrogen gas In alkaline solutions, the hydrogen combines with dissolved oxygenDissolved iron usually is precipitated as iron hydroxide If the precipitate falls on the metal surface, it may slow the corrosion process by acting like a protective coating Iron hydroxide also will react with dissolved oxygen to form ferric hydroxide and may reduce the corrosion rate if the supply of dissolved oxygen is limited.It is apparent from this discussion that corrosion may he controlled if the cathode areas are maintained In a polarized condition and if hydroxide and insoluble reaction products are deposited on the cathode areas",,American Petroleum Institute

Discussion is given to show that these relationships combine in such a manner as to result in decreased rock-bit footage and increased costs at high rotary speeds.Results giving the optimum rotary speed for constant bit weights , where bearings limit footage per bit, are given for specific example using reasonable assumptions when drilling medium-hard to hard formationsCalculations of lowest costs using the optimum constant rotary speed for a given bit weight are given for drilling medium-hard to hard abrasive formations where cutting structure limits bit life. Results are also given showing that still lower costs may be obtained by increasing rotary speed as the bit drills .INTRODUCTIONThe use of rolling-cutter rock bits with the turbodrill has generally resulted in increased drilling rate but decreased rock-bit footage compared to results obtained with conventional rotary practices.1Drilling rates have been increased from 100 to 200 percent. Bit footage has been decreased as much as 75 percent. The reasons for this are not clearly understood because of the differences in operating practices. In many cases the turbodrill utilizes less weight and different bottom-hole cleaning conditions.To better understand the field results, a series of laboratory tests were made.

Loads on individual test bearings were 8,000 lb and 16,000 lb, which are equivalent to approximately 25,000 lb and 50,000 lb on a 7 7/8-in bit Tap water and a bentonite mud containing 15 to 20 percent sand were circulated through the bearings. Bearing failure in tap water resulted from bearing-pun spalling similar to that reported by King2Failure with the bentonite mud resulted predominantly from abrasive wear.Bearing life in total revolutions at 8,000 lb is shown in Fig 1 Because results at 16,000 lb were similar they are not shown. Considering the normal scatter in bearing tests , the results indicate that bearing life in revolutions is independent of rotary speeds within the speeds tested. This important in view of the large number of bearing failures associated with high speeds as will shown later.Fig 1- Roller Bearing Test results (Available in full paper)Fig. 2 Formation: Gray Granite Mud: Lime Base Bit Size: 1 &frac14; In.

Bingman(Shell Oil Co),,,,,,API-60-015,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1960,"Field testing, during -1958 and 1969, of Russian and French-made turbodrills in the United States showed that turbodrilling cannot compete economically with good rotary practices as yet, but should eventually prove competitive where effective bit weight cannot be used with rotary (crooked hole, directional drilling, small hole size, and large surface-hole drilling). Basic research m rock and diamond-bit designs and significant modifications in the turbodrill are needed before turbodrilling will compete economic with good rotary practices except for very special applications.INTRODUCTIONConsiderable interest has been created by reports From the Soviet Union showing the widespread use of Turbodrilling within their drilling operations. Such interest is well-founded, inasmuch as it has long been recognized that some down-hole tool should offer a mole economical method of drilling deep wellsTurbodrilling is certainly not a new drilling method , as a United States patent for a down-hole hydraulic turbine was issued to C. G. Cross as early as 1873. An improved version of this single-stage tool was also patented in the United States in 1884. The first multistage turbodrill, he forerunner of current designs was patented in 1924 In the United States by C. C. Scharpenberg . In the same year, a Russian patent was issued to M. A Kapelyushnikov on a turbodrill utilizing a single -stage 2,000-rpm turbine that was geared down through a planetary gear train to a shaft speed of only 30 rpm A few years later, this complex design was abandoned by the Russians In favor of the multi-stage direct-drive turbodrill similar to the Scharpenberg designTesting of the Scharpenberg turbodrllls, or modifications of this design was conducted intermittently in the United States until 1950, when this work was abandoned because of bearing difficulties and the in significant improvement over rotary performance. The Russians, however, placed more emphasis on the turbodrill method and by 1948 had developed rubber thrust bearings, which proved far superior to either the lubricated or non-lubricated ball bearings previously used. Present-day turbodrills, including those manufactured in other counties, are essentially the same as those designed in Russian in 1948.As evidence of the rapid expansion of turbodrilling In Russia, it is reported that since 1955 turbodrilling has increased from G5 to 8G percent of all drilling for oil and gas. This technique has reportedly increased the average drilling rate from 896 4 to 1,210 meters per rig per month (2,940 to 3,970ft per rig per month), and the average penetration rate from 9 31 to 13.1 meters per hour (30.5 to 43 ft. per hour) during this period in Russia .Undoubtedly these improvements represent considerable progress in drilling technology in Russia. However,could the same type of equipment similarly improveoverall drilling performance in the United States, or was turbodrilling to compete as a special-application tool with current rotary-drilling methods in this country? These questions needed an early answer. Therefore, modern Russian and French turlbodrills were purchased for re-introducing the turbodrlll method in the United States.",,American Petroleum Institute

Air-hammer bit footage was extended in specific instances and overall averages indicate much greater footage per bit may be expected when compared to rotary air drilling.Because the basic design of the air hammer permits optimum performance between 200 and 300 psi air pressure, no changes In the normal air-compressor services for air drilling have been required, other than 10 to 20 percent more volume to maintain a clean hole While drilling at higher penetration ratesField tests on two new accessory tools were used in certain wells included in this report A new top-hole float gave excellent performance and a newly designed bottom-hole float was also used with favorable results These tests further indicate the need for additional research in deviation control. Bits designed for use with the air hammer would greatly add to the life of conventional rock bits.The air-hammer tool design is adapted for use under various drilling conditions However, more evaluation is necessary before this tool is generally accepted by the drilling Industry The tool is designed to operate while mist drilling, but no attempts have been made in the Permian Basin to ward evaluation its performance under these conditions.

These articles for the most part, have been devoted to descriptions of individual installations, and have admirably served to acquaint the industry with these new producing methods. .However, nowhere in the literature can a comprehensive review of these several automation systems be found Probably more important, a discussion of some of the reasons underlying the choice of method and equipment is also lacking The scarcity of this latter type of information makes it particularly difficult for companies or individuals without any experience in automation to select the optimum system, or , worse, to decide whether or not automation should be installed at all .This paper will attempt to add to this meager data by listing the various automation methods currently being used and outlining the factors which influence their selection At the outset, it should be emphasized that there are, probably, many minor variations of each described method Space considerations, alone preclude an enumeration of all these variations, and omission of any one of them should by no means be interpreted as a recommendation against its use.DISCUSSION.For purposes of this review, automatic lease operations Can be conveniently separated into three function Group1Well Control and Production Programming;2Well Testing; and3, Storage and Custody Transfer Within each of these groups, the many types of equipment currently available can be combined on literally hundreds of different ways, Fig 1 through 5 are simplified flow diagrams which illustrate the problem confronting anyone who must design or select a lease automation system For example. It is evident from Fig 1 and 2 that there are at least three methods for controlling flowing wells and four methods for controlling pumping wells Fig 3 shows three general methods of well testing.

No one has said how much to raise the mud weight or what size choke to useIn the field there 1s a considerable lack of understanding about the mechanics of a threatened blowout, and practically no knowledge of how to kill one this is clearly illustrated by the usual statement that nothing happened except that all of a sudden, the well was blowing gas Of course, the word blowout strikes fear in the mind of everyone in an oil company from roughneck to chairman of the board The roughneck fears for his life, the board chairman for his company?s bank account As a result, very few blowouts are approached rationally; and there is a strong tendency among rig. personnel to leave the rig rather than to analyze the situation and correct it. It is believed that this fear steams from the lack of knowledge on the part of those concerned with drilling wellsA study has been made of a number of conditions which lead to blowouts and a method for the conditions of each is proposed, leaving little to guesswork Calculation are made which show the rate of gain of mud (inflow of foreign fluid) resulting from kick of varying Intensity and the significance of each rate is discussed. The work of a number of writers is drawn from, but particularly that of Bell' inasmuch as his is the most comprehensive published to date.GENERALBlowout prevention is not a matter of the number of valves in the preventer system, their arrangement, or the ability of people to operate them.

Initial drilling and completion methods, derived from oil-field practice, did not solve the problem The utilization of water well-drilling methods using a reveries circulating system and completion with gravel-packed concreted casing brought an economical solutionINTRODUCTIONWater flooding has come of age in recent years in California and particularly in the Los Angeles Basin The largest flood at present and destined to become the largest anywhere is in the Wilmington FieldWater flooding was initiated in the Wilmington Field during 1953 by the Long Beach Harbor Department through their contractor the Long Beach Oil Development Company During the launching of this pilot flood the question of water supply was thoroughly examined Of the three general sources available - fresh, ocean,and produced - the fresh water was unusable because of incompatibility and the produced water, although sufficient in quantity for a pilot project, would require extensive treatment and would eventually, if the project were expanded, prove insufficient in quantity. The remaining source, ocean water, was available directly or from shallow sand which were ocean fed. The shallow sand were chosen because water taken directly from the bay was high in oxygen content and would also require filtering.EARLY DEVELOPMENTThe problem of drilling and completing the salt-water source well was, generally speaking, attacked by conventional-oil-well: methods. Over a 6-year period 10 wells were frilled using a rotary-drilling method with clay-base mud as a circulating medium, casing the hole with a machine-slotted steel casing, and using a uniform-size gravel in the annulus for sand control.DrillingA conventional rotary method was used employing clays-base mud as a drilling fluid to drill a 30-m to 40-m. hole to depths ranging from 120 ft. to 216 ft.. Although it was realized that the mud would cause some formation blocking, it was found impossible to prevent caving without some viscous drilling medium, Vigorous swabbing after completion was found to reduce the mud block but still left something to be desired.CasingSteel casing ranging in size from 11 &frac34; -in. to 16 in and perforated with 60-mesh machine cut slots was used for the production strings in the first three wells. After the abandonment of the original well because of sand entry resulting from corrosion and slot enlargement, the12 &frac34; -in or 13 3/8 -in casing strings of five wells subsequently drilled were perforated with 70-mesh slots and entirely coated with phonetic plastic. Although these string performed wells were completed using similarly slotted wrought-iron casing of which one string was run uncoated and one string was coated with asphalt-base paint This was spectacular failure as both wells were idled in less than a year because of sand entry from corrosionGravel PackingOf the first 10 wells, 5 were gravel packed with Tyler 6-8 mesh gravel and the remaining 5 used simple mixtures of a large and small size, eg, 6-8 and 3/8 in",,American Petroleum Institute

The design and operation of the Four Corners system, including maintenance and meter-proving operations, are described, and the economics of the system are evaluated.INTRODUCTIONThe Four Corners area came into being as an important oil producing region In 1955 after discoveries in the Paradox Basin and Aneth Field of Utah and the San Juan Basin of New Mexico Drilling and production were limited , however, because of the lack of a suitable means of transporting crude to major markets In January 1957 Four Corners Pipe Line Company was formed, and soon after construction was begun on a pipeline to California Full-scale shipment through this line began in March 1958. A few months later, a pipe-line to Texas was also completed by Texas-New Mexico Pipe Line CompanyThe time required to obtain a pipeline outlet for Four Corners' crude provided an excellent opportunity for evaluating and planning LACT installations. As drilling was continued during this waiting period, good estimates of peak production and reserves were available prior to connection to a pipeline, making possible a realistic evaluation of LACT vs, manual gaging Also, adequate time was afforded for design, procurement of approvals, and the installation of LACT before full-scale oil-handling facilities were neededAnother important factor contributing to the appropriateness Of LACT to the Four Corners area is the remoteness of producing leases and the lack of improved roads As shown in Fig 1, Shell?s producing leases are located in isolated sections of Utah and New Mexico, mostly on the Navajo Indian Reservation or on Government lands . The land in general is arid badly eroded, and made up of rocky mesas, arroyos, and dry washes Consequently , considerable time is required to travel between leases, making it advantageous to use automation as means of reducing the frequency of tripsLACT DesignA positive-displacement metering-type LACT system was chosen the standard for Shell?s installations in the Four Corners area Equipment was selected to perform the usual necessary functions of a LACT system, which are listed followingAutomatically transfer crude from the producer to the pipeline companyAccurately measure the volume of oil shippedObtain a representative sample of the crude shipped for oil gravity and BS W content determinationsPrevent shipment of oil above a maximum allowed percent BS WStop shipment when malfunctions occur which might create measurement errors, oil losses, or equipment damageFig. 1 - Location of Leases with LACT (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Cities Service operates approximately 1,200 wells In West Kansas . having an average water cut of 90 percent Many wells are producing 98 to 99 percent water. The principal water-producing formations are Arbuckle, Gorham, Reagan, and Viola, all of which are more than slightly corrosive.In the early life of oil production in West Kansas, water production was not much of a problem. As water production increased, pump sized were also increased to maintain oil production and little attention was paid to the added stresses imposed on the sucker-rod string . Also, little was known about corrosion inhibition Consequently, the added stresses and the effects of corrosion soon made themselves known in the form of sucker-rod failures Fig 1 shows how sucker-rod breaks increased as water percentages Increased From 1946 to 1953, water cut Increased from 59 5 percent to 85.8 percent while rod breaks increased from 716 to 1,788 per year. Since 1953, water cuts have further increased to 90 percent a t the present time, but our sucker-rod parts have decreased to 766 In 1959. T h ~ s1s a reduction of 57 percent in 6 years.The number of wells operated can be a Big factor in the number of rod breaks one experiences.

In earlier reviews1,2attention was directed to mud engineering in relation to such problems as loss of circulation, sloughing shale, high pressures, high temperatures, and soluble salts Progress has been made toward the solution of these problem and also in the attempt to increase rate of penetration trough control of properties of the drilling fluid3,4Because drilling-mud performance is related to weight, flow properties, filtration, and lubrication, these topics will be discussed in term of current practices Example will be given of the utilization of this experience in planning mud programs Recovery of circulation and fluid for completion will considered as special problems. This review is limited to the Texas Gulf Coast because mud practices in coastal Louisiana have been surveyed in recent papers5,6CURRENT MUD PROGRAMSAggregated Mud SystemsFor a number of years prior to 1956mud types were restricted mainly to lime muds and low-ph muds containing emulsified oil. Since 1956 lime muds have been replaced for many application by aggregated mud systems such as shale-control, surfactant, and gysumtreated. Shale-control muds use a controlled filtrate alkalinity and a high calcium-ion concentration in the filtrate to stabilize shale by chemical means7,8Surface tant mud utilize heat-stable non-ronic surface-active agents, along with soluble electrolytes, to flocculate the clay solids in the mud and inhibit clay swelling9,10,11Gypsum-treated mud filtrates contain a high calciumion Concentration Ferrochrome lignosulfonate is used As a deflocculant.12, 13Lime-treated MudsThe familiar lime mud is still used in about half of the wells that require mud weights as high as 12lb per gal. Normally, mud are converted from low-pH to lime -treated muds in anticipation of higher mud-weight requirements and possible contamination by gypsum, salt water, or cement The mud usually is converted at a depth such that little or no dilution is required or when mud-weight requirements are low (below 11.0 lb per gal) An example of present practice is that of a well in Aransas County. The native shale mud was converted at 5,500ft by adding 2 lb per bbl caustic soda, 2 lb per bbl lignite, 2lb per bbl tannin, 4.5 lb per bbl Lime and 10 percent by volume diesel oil Properties of the mud after conversion were: weight 9,7 lb per gal.: funnel viscosity, 37 sec; gels,0-0g; filtrate, 9.6 ml; filtrate alkalinity, 5 ml; and available lime, 4.0 lb per bbl",,American Petroleum Institute

Several types of shutoff material are now readily available through the service companies as are the tools and techniques needed to complete a water-shutoff job.INTRODUCTIONAir and gas drilling is economically 11mlted In use to areas where formation waters do not present too great a problem. Aerated mud and the use of surfactants to mist drill have helped where competent formations are penetrated1However, almost all economic failures In air or gas drilling are caused by formation waters.A fast, inexpensive method of shutting off water has been a major objective for many research organizationsThis report is Intended as a review of the materials and mechanics now in use for the purpose of shutting off formation waters.HISTORYThe first time a water-bearing formation was penetrated with air or gas as a drilling fluid, the idea of water shutoff arose. The old standby, cement, was first used in the early attempts to plug the water zone. A few jobs were successful; however, the cost Involved In waiting time made this approach unacceptableGels and emulsions that had been used In selective completion work were tried with no degree of success.Another approach was to form a sheath in an enlarged well bore where low-pressure zones were encountered. This technique used high-velocity air to erode the hole through the water-bearing section. A length of plastic pipe with cup-type packers spaced to cover the interval to be treated would be filled with an epoxy resin and spotted opposite the zone (see Fig. 1) The resin was then displaced Into the enlarged hole and chemically timed to set according to the temperature. Therefore, no appreciable waiting time was required. The resin expanded while setting to as much as five times its original volume. After the resin had set up, the drill pipe was rotated to break a neck on the plastic pipe. A bit was then run to drill a hole through the plastic pipe and resin, thus leaving an impermeable sheath to exclude the water.This technique showed some success, but was limited to low-pressure formations. As research capacity was limited , attention was directed to other shutoff methods.Research at this point was directed toward a material that could be squeezed Into the formation a t relatively low pressures. This material would need a very low viscosity until it was squeezed into place. Thus placed Into the formation it would set up either on contact with the water or through the chemical timer.Fig. 1 - Resin Displaced into the Eroded Well Bore with a Calculated Hydrostatic Head of Water and Allowed to Set (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Satisfactory experience obtained indicates attractive economics, particularly at locations where dehydration is also requiredINTRODUCTIONSince the first short-cycle solid-desiccant hydrocarbon recovery unit appeared on the market a few years ago, there has been a growing acceptance of this type of equipment as a part of the gas-handling facilities for gas-condensate well production A great potential exists for these units inasmuch as they not only dehydrate the gas stream but also recover hydrocarbons without the need for either a large pressure drop or a separate operating staffThis paper briefly describes history of development, processes and types of equipment available, and experience obtained by Shell a t a number of fields In Louisiana with units of various types ranging In capacity from 5 to 24 MMcf per day Installed cost for these units ranged from about $30,000 to $140,000DevelopmentIt may be interesting to trace the development of the hydrocarbon recovery units Gas-purchase contracts, particularly those for gas which goes into interstate transmission lines, usually require the water-vapor content of the gas not to exceed 6 or 7 lb per MMcf. These rather stringent requirements led to the development about 12 years ago of a skid-mounted dry-desiccant dehydrator for lease use, using an alumina or silica gel compound as the drying agent. These adsorption-type units, operating on 6- to 12-hour cycles, proved very effective In dehydrating gas to the contract requirements and, by using automatic controls, were found to operate free of trouble The dehydrators were usually installed In conjunction with a conventional heater-separator hookup for pressure reduction and condensate recovery. An appreciable amount of the heavier hydrocarbons, however, was left In the sales gas in this manner.Increased liquid recovery was obtained when low- temperature separation units were developed about 10 years ago Although having as their prime function increased liquid recovery, these units are usually capable of dehydrating the gas to contract specification. At least 1,000 psr pressure differential across the expansion valve, however, is generally required for such units to perform economically and provide adequate dehydration This pressure-drop limitation restricts the application of these units to high-pressure fields and then often to only part of the reservoir lifeA demand existed, therefore, for a dehydration process which would not depend upon a pressure drop and would be capable of economically extracting part of the liquefiable hydrocarbons left after primary separation ,This demand has been a large factor in stimulating the development of the hydrocarbon-recovery unit and also in its ready acceptance by the industry.Recognition a few years ago that certain improved desiccants as used in dehydrators had the ability to adsorb hydrocarbons",,American Petroleum Institute

Holland(Humble Oil Refining Company),,,,,,API-60-094,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1960,"Difficulty is often encountered in producing oil from wells completed in unconsolidated sand formations because the loose sand becomes entrained in the produced fluid stream This paper describes the use of silicon tetrachloride to consolidate loose sand. An oil solution of silicon tetrachloride is injected into the unconsolidated sand formation and reacts with the interstitial water to form a siliceous bonding precipitate The resulting consolidate sand is strong and permeableLaboratory investigations showed that the quality of the consolidation was insensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, injection rate, type of sand, and nature of the water in contact with the sand. The optimum concentration range was defined. Maximum strength and permeability were obtained hen the sand was strongly water-met The consolidated sand remained stable to the flow of oil but deteriorated when subjected to the prolonged flow of hot water Chemical treatments were developed to enhance the stability.INTRODUCTIONThe movement of loose sand into the well bore of oil and gas wells has been a troublesome problem for many years. A number of techniques have been used to alleviate the sand problem These Include gravel packing, screens and liners , and various kinds of porous filters. Two disadvantages of these methods are the mechanical Difficulties in placing the equipment and the tendency for the materials to become plugged Furthermore, it is impractical to use them in conjunction with a new completion technique' and In dually completed wellsAnother method of preventing the entry of sand into the well bore is the consolidation of the loose sand adjacent to the well bore. The use of plastics as a consolidating agent was reported2,3,4a number of years ago Although sand control by the use of consolidating plastics has been successful and has found widespread use,5,6,7it does not provide the ultimate objectives of simplicity In treatment, universality of application, and cheapness of cost which are desirable The work described in this paper was undertaken in an attempt to perfect a simple , low-cost composition and technique for the instantaneous consolidation of loose sand without regard to formation temperature or other formation .characteristics The chemical selected for investigation was silicon tetrachloride, because it reacts instantaneously with water to form a siliceous cementing material Several factors have been investigated to develop a suitable method of applying the silicon tetrachloride and to investigate the stability of the consolidated sand.The treatment of formations with silicon tetrachloride was first discussed in the literature more than 20 years ago8,9,10At that time, It was proposed as a method to selectively plug water-producing formations. to prevent sloughing of shale, and to block the production of sand The method was tested in oil fields to shut off water; however, it has not become commercially applicable for consolidating reservoir sand, even though it has been used to consolidate sand in the laboratory11In recent years, factors which might affect the use of this chemical in the consolidation of sand have become better understood",,American Petroleum Institute

To investigate other avenues, a 2-well experimental program was launched in the fall of 1956. The purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of slim-hole drilling and completion The experimental program entailed cementing 2 7/8-in. tubing in 6 &frac14; -in. holeThe result of these two experimental wells were sufficiently rewarding that a technique evolved for the drilling and completion of all future wells in the Pembina fields where water of free gas is no particular problem. Thirty-six wells have been completed to date using the slim-hole technique, with depths varying from 2,600 ft. to 6,900 ft.Experience to date has proved that no particular saving can be realized in the drilling phase. At the time locations came up, rigs equipped for slim-hole work were not readily available and contractors were bidding equivalent rates for slim holes and conventional holes. Therefore, consideration of the drilling phase has been omitted from this paper with discussion confined to completion technique, producing practices, and some related experiencespaper three wells have been completed on this manner; and not only are cost savings realized, but there is a definite operational advantage over conventional dual-zone completionsDISCUSSIONWell ProgramA typical well program for a slim-hole completion in the Cardium sand would be as follows (see Fig 1)Drill sufficient 9 7/8 -in hole to set 450 ft. of 7-in surface casingDrill 6 &frac14; -in, hole to the top of the Cardium sand.Cut a 50-ft diamond core with 5 &frac12;- in bitReam the rat hole with 6 &frac14; -in bit and deepen the hole required depth , ie sufficient hole to permit setting the float shoe approximately 50 ft. below the anticipated bottom perforationRun the production string of 2 7/8-in tubing with 4 &frac12; -in. float shoe, 4 &frac12;-in X 2 7/8- in swage, 10-ft pup joint-open friction-type pump seating nipple on the string approximately 100ft above the payCement with sufficient volume to bring the cement top 200 ft. into the surface casing, displacing the wiper plug with 1 bbl of oil, 250 gal of acid, and the remainder oilAfter 6 hours waiting-on-cement time, bleed off pressure and head up .",,American Petroleum Institute

The equations derived were programmed for an IBM 650 computer for calculating loads on both the upstroke and downstroke, and the static and coulomb friction loads were added to the dynamic loads. The effects of varying pumping speed, length of stroke, viscosity, net lift , and friction and specific gravity were computed by means of the program. The polished-rod load increases exponentially with increasing speed and linearly with Increasing stroke length. Low-viscosity fluids have little effect on the load, but as the viscosity approaches 10-2, the load increases rapidly . Both the dynamic and total loads increase slightly with net lift . friction affects primarily the static load, and specific gravity affects primarily the dynamic load. The measured load for 33 wells is within 10 percent of the calculated load for 30 of the cases.INTRODUCTIONOver the years considerable effort has been devoted toward a better understanding of the nature of sucker-rod pumping. This problem was investigated by CoberlylMills2Kemler,3Slonneger,4and other during the 30's and 40's. Since World War I1 the trend has been to extend the lumped-parameter analytical approach by considering the rods, fluid, and tubing as continuous or distributed systems This approach under the directions of Howe5and Kemler has led to a set of equations considered to be beyond analytical solution. These investigations , together with Halderson,6been instrumental in the present impetus toward simulation and analog solutionsIn the lumped-parameter method of analysis the entire mass of the element is assumed to be concentrated at a point, and the elastic effects are assumed to be in a massless spring connecting the mass and the driving element The continuous or distributed method of analysis assumes the mass and elasticity to be uniformly distributed throughout-the element.It is generally recognized that a complete analysis must consider the surface equipment , the rod string, fluid column , tubing , and bottom-hole pump. To make an analysis which would consider all these elements requires that the nature of the various elements must be known or characteristics. An objective of this paper is to determine the characteristics of the rods Another objective is to determine the relative importance of other well elements In contributing to the load on the rods. Realization of these objectives would, of course, only be another step toward a more complete analysis where consideration would be given to the surface equipment as well as subsurface equipment. It should be noted, however, that the rods are the most significant of the well elements in determining the nature of the overall system.The primary emphasis of this paper is to investigate the dynamic loads in the rods",,American Petroleum Institute

The paper included mechanical-property data on extruded plastics and glass-reinforced plastics available at that time, as well as some limited amount of data on extruded plastics coatings. In general the paper pointed up two rules than must be followed in using plastics to much more rigid degree than when steel is used :Know the significant mechanical and chemical characteristics of the plastic to be usedKnow, with some degree of precision, the conditions to which it is to be subjected.More recent developments in terms of properties of old products, the introduction of new materials, and engineering philosophy are presented herein on the three major categories of piping plastics -extruded plastics, glass-reinforced plastics, and plastic coatings.

Although this method has been satisfactory In some cases, open-hole completions are not always desirable With casing set through the productive formation, attempts to control the fracture initiation have been primarily by the use of multiple explosive charges either placed in a single plane1,2,3or arranged to result In a convergence of forces on a plane formed by other explosive charges4Whereas each of these methods has had successful application , a recent method of well-bore preparation provides a penetration pattern that is continuous around the periphery of the borehole and is not dependent upon the characteristics of the formation rock In the new method, a circumferential V-shaped notch is cut mechanically. In cutting a notch mechanically, the shape of the notch depends upon the control of the operation of the cutting tool and the design of the cutting blades. This paper discusses a mechanical tool with which the cutting action can be controlled Also discussed are the operational procedure for well-bore preparation and the blades that were designed to obtain the desired shape of circumferential notch.TOOL FOR WELL-BORE NOTCHINGA survey of the various types of tools that might be used for cutting a V-notch in al well bore indicated that two general types of tools could be used. In one, the blades more radically outward; in the second the blades pivot about a fixed pin in the tools body With the first type a cut of small width in the well bore could be btained ; however, the shallow penetration into the formation would limit the effectiveness of the notch made.

The interrelationship of the many factors is discussed In detail . Useful diagnostic tools and observations are presented to enable the new water flooder to establish a water-quality control programINTRODUCTIONBefore water-quality control IS discussed, water quality must be first defined In order to define water quality, the purpose for which the water is to be used must be specifiedThe major consideration of water quality for subsurface Injection is that the water must be good enough to enable the water-injection program to be carried out to completion at minimum cost. This simply is a water quality which enables injection of the water into the formation at the desired injection rate without prohibitive pressures and which will not cause more corrosion than can be economically lived with during the time necessary to get the job done.1All other definitions of water quality actually are not definitions of water quality, but are detailed specifications or analyses of the water, all of which are important In order to maintain a given water quality necessary for the completion of the operationFACTORS INFLUENCING WATER QUALITYNow that water quality has been defined, the factors which cause the water quality to be less than desirable will be discussed These can be divided into two major considerations, namely, injection suitability and corrosion characteristics.Injection suitability means simply, can the desired volume of water be forced into the subsurface formation a t economical injection pressures? Any particulate matter in the water that is large enough to be strained out by the sand or porous formation face will, In due time, build a filter cake and gradually raise injection pressures up to a substantial value, oftentimes up to complete plugging.There are also chemical considerations. Water may react with the formation mineral components and cause plugging by either swelling of formation clays or by movement of formation fines to plug pore channels or by production of insoluble material In the formationThe subject of whether or not the water is compatible With the formation from the standpoint of composition is beyond the scope of this paper This compatibility should be investigated before ever Injecting a waterPARTICULATE MATTERReferring back to the subject of particulate matter, this particulate matter can be oil clay, silt, sand. algae, scale, corrosion products (particularly Iron sulfide or iron hydroxide), bacteria, and bacterial growths2.3The setting of a specification for desired water quality With regard to particulate matter is based upon the ability of the formation to take water containing solids2Many oil sands are rather low in permeability and can be plugged readily by particulate matter in any amount The amount of plugging by the particulate matter determines how long water can be Injected into the sand before injection pressures become excessiveFor the purposes of this paper, it is assumed that all particulate",,American Petroleum Institute

This presentation focuses on the interpretive use of post-stack seismic attributes for seismic reservoir characterization. Multiple seismic attributes facilitate structural interpretation and recognition of seismic stratigraphy, but as importantly, they may offer clues to lithology typing and estimation of fluid content from seismic data. Potential benefits include reduction of stratigraphic and structural drilling risks, seismic reservoir characterization in exploration settings, and value increase of new and vintage 3D seismic data. Immediate improvements in drilling risk reduction can be obtained by using multiple seismic attributes. This enhancement occurs because each seismic attribute computation resembles a non-linear filter that decomposes reflection data into its constituents, and, as a consequence, use of multiple seismic attributes restores much of the discriminating information retained in the originally recorded wavefield (Barnes, 2001; Taner, 2001). Thus, each seismic attribute, for instance, amplitude, inadvertently contains only a subset of the total information recorded, since a single seismic attribute represents only one numerical property of a propagating seismic wavefield. In this presentation, we advocate the use of geometric attributes in conjunction with relative acoustic impedance and frequency-derived seismic attributes. In the past, use of geometric attributes was mostly limited to edge detection, where edges in the seismic data commonly represent faults or stratigraphic terminations (seismic facies changes). In this Devonian Slave Point Formation case study, we use post-stack seismic attributes to • Determine the azimuths of conjugate fracture trends in the subsurface • Identify “leaky” vs. sealing fault segments and possible migration/charge/escape pathways. • Identify “sweet spots” in the subsurface Blind testing helped confirm validity of interpretational approach in identifying porous dolostone facies and has resulted in ranking of future prospect locations. 3-D seismic examples are from northeast British Columbia, Canada (Bubbles Survey) and were provided by Olympic Seismic.

Air and gas drilling , where applicable, have indicated further reductions In drilling costs. The analysis of 14 years of drilling in the Pincher Creek Field shows the improvement in drilling rates and the reduction In drilling costs resulting from these changes In drilling technique. .INTRODUCTION.Abnormally high Foothills drilling costs are of prime concern to all companies operating in the Foothills Belt of Western Canada. The high drilling costs reflect the complexity of the drilling problems encountered. Extreme crooked-hole tendencies, caving shales, and hard-rock drilling are encountered in various degrees of seventy throughout the Foothills. Of these, crooked-hole tendencies generally present the greatest problem and contribute most to the high drilling costs Steeply dipping beds associated with complex folds and numerous faults in the shallower sediments, form surface down to 8,000 ft., are responsible for the severe crooked-hole drilling problems.During the past 14 years of operation In the Alberta Foothills, various changes In drilling techniques have improved drilling costs. Packed-hole drilling - using 11%-in. drill collars to drill 12%-in. hole, relaxation of maximum deviation limits with closer control of the rate of change of deviation, and the use of low-weight, low-solids muds In the top 6,000 to 8,000 ft. of hole are the major factors contributing to the reduction in Foothills drilling costs. Recent tests with air and gas as a circulating medium have shown considerable promise, with indicated large reductions in drilling costs.It is the purpose of this paper to outline the results of the various changes in drilling procedure and to comment on new techniques presently under test. The British-American Oil Company's Foothills drilling experience has been primarily concentrated in the Pincher Creek Field where a fairly continuous drilling program has been in operation for the past 14 years This report is primarily based on the drilling data obtained from drilling experience in the Pincher Creek Field.GEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THEFOOTHILLS BELTGeneralThe Western Canada sedimentary basin is bounded on the east by the Pre-Cambrian Shield and on the west by the Rocky Mountains.

Lane(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-61-017,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Previous data available to the petroleum industry have shown that relatively low-strength cement is capable of supporting the casing in oil wells. Recent developments in which the casing-supporting ability of cement is evaluated under simulated bottom-hole temperature and pressure conditions show that by proper selection of cement, waiting-on-cement (WOC) times may be reduced to the order of 4 to 8 hours Under such conditions, the time required to perform the necessary rig operations becomes the limiting factor the necessary rig operations becomes the limiting factor Therefore, revised rig operations to eliminate no-productive time are suggested. Adoption of this procedure by the industry should effect a saving of 30,000 rig-days per year.INTRODUCTIONPortland cement was first used in oil wells in 1903 In accordance with the accepted practice for construction work at that time, the wells were shut down 28 days to allow the cement to set1As the use of portland cement became more widespread, waiting-on-cement times were reduced. During the 1930?s the general practice was to wait 72 hours This figure became an almost uniform provision in conservation rules.In 1945, R F Farris2presented a method for determining minimum WOC time which considered the differences that exist between types and brands of cements as well as individual well conditions such as depth, temperature , and pressure The method was based on a laboratory investigation of cement bonding strength determined by measuring the force applied to a 4-ft length of 5 &frac12; - in casing with respect to a 9 5/8 -in casing simulating the well bore. This work led to the conclusion that dement at a tensile strength of 8 psr was adequate to secure the pipe in the hole Correlations Were determined which indicated that the time to reach 8 psr tensile strength is equal to the time from the initial mixing of the cement to the time when the shut-in casing pressure reached a maximum, multiplied by 15 As a result of this work, state and field regulations were revised to allow minimum WOC times of approximately 24 hoursSeveral regulatory bodies have since reduced minimum WOC times to less than 24 hours. In 1957, Davis and Faulk3showed that often certain rig operations such as rippling-down rippling-up, and running logs that must follow most cement operations could still be performed in less time than the required WOC time.In an effort to reduce the resulting non-productive rig time, a comprehensive laboratory and field study was initiated to 1, re-establish the minimum strength requirements of cements in oil wells, 2, determine at what time minimum strengths of cementing systems currently being utilized were obtained under simulated well conditions, 3 formulate a revised WOC time policy based on these evaluations; and 4, revise cementing and rig operations to take maximum advantage of the reduced WOC times The results of this investigation are presented in this paper.STRENGTH REQUIREMENT OF CEMENTSLaboratory Tests of Casing-supporting AbilityTo investigate the strength requirement of cements.",,American Petroleum Institute

Slurry quantity and final pressure assumed secondary importance based upon a study of a large number of conventional squeezes that followed generally accepted criteria Examination of core taken from a conventional job showed that premature dehydration occurred inside the casing, preventing effective sealing of perforations, Precise control over slurry dehydration allows the positioning of cement at all locations of desired seal and the reversing of excess slurry from the squeezed interval This control is possible it slurries have low filtration rates under conditions of squeezing The development and testing of this type slurry is described The technique of applying these cements includes an extended period of intermittent pumping at decreasing rates and increasing shutdown times. A normal job may require from 3 to 6 hours. application of the technique described, with carefully formulated cement, resulted in the single-stage sealing of a 230ft perforated interval. This job is illustrative of the possibilities of the method. Studied use of the technique with materials now available has resulted in a high success ration and has generally eliminated the need to drill cement.INTRODUCTIONSqueeze cementing is the forcing of cement slurry by pressure to specific points in a well1The purpose is to obtain cementitious seals at the points of squeeze Generally this implies the plugging of holes in casing and filling cavities behind the casing or in the formation. Seals, which usually consist of slurry solids containing minimum water for hydration, from when pressure drives slurry water from filter cake into a surrounding porous formation.Success in a squeeze process requires placing cement seals that will prevent fluid flow into or out the treated formation interval. It is measured by maintaining for a short time a higher pressure in the well or formation as indicated by the expected magnitude and direction of future stress on the seals. This is called pressure testing or dry testing, depending upon the direction of the differential.This paper is a summation of the authors? experiences with some aspects of cement squeezing over the past 5 years These experiences have been more meaningful because of guideposts erected by Huber, Tausch, and Dublin2Shell and Wynne3Binkley , Dumbauld, and Collins4and others.

Further study revealed a similarity in the unexplained cases. Sticking occurred with the bit off bottom and pipe motionless in the hole Circulating pressures and rates were normal. The drill collars were opposite a permeable formation. These symptoms fit a type sticking first reported by Heldmick and Longley1differential-pressure stickingDifferential-pressure sticking can occur in almost any mud-drilled hole, but it is more prevalent in abnormal-pressure areas where the differences in mud-column and formation pressure is carried by the filter cake However, if an object such as a drill collar contacts and isolates a portion of the cake, the pressure initially carried by the isolated area is transferred to an equivalent area of the drill collar If the formation behind the filter cake is permeable and the pressure difference high, the pressure transfer occurs rapidly. In time the force becomes sufficient to hold the collar against the side of the hole and prevents its being pulled free During this sticking process the isolated portion of the filter cake dries and shrinks as it loses fluid by filtration, thus increasing the cake-collar friction and contact area Consequently the longer the drill string is motionless, the more force needed to pull it freeOutmans2explained the mechanism of differential-pressure Sticking by soil mechanics. He also presented A theory on why spotting oil releases stuck pipe. Although neither Helmick and Longley nor Outmans resolved the problem, they did provide basic information and ideas. Tschirley and Tanner3reported success in reducing stuck pipe by using a wetting agent to promote oil coating of mud solids and drilling tools.In order to check some of these ideas and to find techniques for preventing or freeing stuck pipe, a laboratory study was initiated.Low Differential- Pressure StudiesLaboratory Apparatus and ProceduresTest apparatus simulating a well through a porous formation provided the following data 1.

Weintritt(Baroid DivNational Lead Co),,,,,,API-61-042,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Many of the additives now used In drilling fluids are unsuitable for use at high temperatures. Modification of formulations or the development of entirely new drilling-mud materials is a matter of continuous research. Successful high-temperature mud formulations are closely related to their filtration properties. This relation has accelerated the development of the portable, high-pressure, high-temperature filter press. The preferred method of operating this unit and the various types of information that may be obtained are discussed .Extended time-filtration tests were made to obtain correlation with filtration that may occur when mud circulation has ceased.INTRODUCTIONHistoricalThe principles of drilling -mud control were formulated a quarter-century ago From this foundation special drilling fluids and a variety of testing equipment have been developed that have greatly contributed to the increased depth to which wells are now drilled Corollaries are: an increase in the footage of uncased open hole and a decrease In the hole diameter necessary to reach a given depth Probable depth limits of present drilling muds would be at earth temperatures of 500 F or about 30,000 ft.Why Laboratory Studies are UsefulMost laboratory studies of drilling muds are made because of problems that reoccur In the field. Sometime entirely new problems such as drilling to extreme depths are presented, in which case little information on the probable behavior of the drilling mud is available When measuring the behavior of drilling muds where large experimental errors are practically unavoidable, it is desirable to have as much experimental control as possible and to sort out the experimental errors In a systematic fashion. Otherwise , not much can be forecast about the significance of apparent treatment effects in practice this experimentation is reported as method, limits , and degree of accuracy. Because drilling-mud chemistry is complex, some of the specifications are arrived at empirically and have little true meaning.Of the many tests that operations personnel can run on drilling fluids to be used at high temperature, only the high-pressure, high-temperature filter press measures a property of a mud at the actual temperature and pressure that may occur In use. Therefore, it is desirable to study filtration at high temperature so that understanding and interpretation of results can be applied with more confidence.Which Drilling Mud is Stable at High Temperature?No one product nor mud type will guarantee temperature stability. The filtration properties of 38 field muds are shown In Table 1. It is apparent that even within each class of mud, an equivalent API filtrate loss does not mean that each will have similar filtrate loss at hig temperature The second column of each group shows what the filtration at the elevated temperature would be of the muds were affected only by a decrease In the viscosity of the base fluid.Because -the viscosity of water decreases with temperature, an increase In filtration rate may be expected. This Increase, where other factors are not involved, may be calculated from the API filtration test1",,American Petroleum Institute

Stone(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-61-049,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"A number of unusually fast southern Louisiana wells have been drilled . These were climaxed by one drilled to 10,000 ft. in 3 34 days. A plan called massive elimination was utilized to produce these results consistently It cut rig time by drastically eliminating motions, maneuvers, and labor-utilizing activity. It used new type wellhead equipment while eliminating obsolete techniques, time-consuming practices, many materials, and extravagant well-completion time. Powerful, modern rigs were used continuously. Drilling plans prepared in advance were followed and improved by a special task force of efficiency supervisors High speeds cut drilling costs. A 200-percent increase in drilling speed and related action can reduce well costs 50 percent The fast hole created some problems but they were insignificant compared with those eliminated Many benefits were obtained. Conclusions are that high speeds can be produced consistently through control of influencing factors . With a specified sum of money, twice as many wells can be drilled when costs are cut 50 percent. Added wells double annual increase in production from development operations and double discovery of new reserves from exploratory operations.The net result is growth for producer and increased business for allotted service industry. It is predicted that a well ultimately will be drilled to 10,000 ft. in 2 daysINTRODUCTIONIn the past three years several companies have drilled wells along the southern Louisiana Coast in remarkably short periods of time. One operator is reported to be drilling and completing 9,000-ft single wells near the mouth of the Mississippi River in about 7 days. Another operator drilled a well in Carllou Island Field to 14.000ft in 14 days1passing the 10,000ft level in approximately 6 days. Many others are obtaining high penetration rates, especially while drilling loosely consolidated shallow formations found in certain areas of the Gulf Coast Drilling times of around 10,000 ft. in 10 days or more still are most common, however, in the vast majority of the coastal fields where harder formations are encountered.It is difficult to determine with a high degree of accuracy all factors responsible for the higher speeds This problem frequently exists even within individual companies In many cases the well plans vary from job to job on each rig causing variations in time. The multitude of drilling problems encountered within the region also is a distracting influence in determining the efficiency of certain operations. Organizational complexities and weak reporting methods further hamper the assembly of fact. The factors responsible for high speeds usually remain a mystery. As a result, most fast holes are explained with such comments as : We had good luck ; Good run due to no trouble , etc. These improved performances can be more accurately analyzed.This paper illustrates and analyzes speed-influencing factors and shows how they can be controlled intentionally to produce high speeds consistently. The illustration will be made through an example to remove the elements of conjecture, theory, and mere opinion.

In areas where sufficient data were available, the information is presented in the form of a map showing lines of isothermal gradients. In other areas the temperature-depth relationships is presented in tabular form.INTRODUCTIONA knowledge of subsurface temperatures is important to the oil industry for numerous and varied reasons. This has been particularly true in recent years because of deeper drilling and the associated higher temperatures. Accurate temperatures are needed in determining fluid . Good estimates are needed in developing drilling muds, formation treatments of carious type, down-hole instruments, and for other reservoir engineering applications This paper is an extension of an earlier paper1and presents the complication of temperature-depth information in the form of an extended gradient map where sufficient data permits (Fig 1). The data are presented in tabular form for other areas (Table 1, page 59.)DISCUSSIONTemperatures measured in wells during or soon after circulation of drilling fluids should not be expected to be representative of true formation temperatures. The effects of drilling fluids on measured temperatures have been reported by various authors2,3,4It has been reported that the time required to attain thermal equilibrium may vary from a day two to years2For this reason data from electric logs and drill-stem tests have been eliminated for the purposes of this paper Obviously ,temperature data measured for the purpose of locating the height of fresh cement behind the casing also cannot be used for this purpose.The temperature used in preparing this paper were obtained from glass maximum-recording thermometers The temperature were measured in conjunction with bottom-hole pressure surveys and subsurface sampling The measurements were taken in oil and gas wells which had been completed for periods of several days to several years. AT the time of measurement the wells has been shut in for periods ranging from a few hours to several days.Authors have reported that subsurface temperatures increase approximately linearly with depth in most cases1,2,3,5,6This was found to be true in this study in cases where sufficient data were available for an evaluation. The straight-line assumption was used in preparing the isothermal gradient map in Fig 1 The mean surface temperature was taken as 74 F This value was chosen in order that the data be compatible with that presented by E.A Nichols in his paper Geothermal Gradients in Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Oil Fields 1An average of 67 surface temperature presented by Tutschulte and Nichols6was slightly over 72 F. This difference is well within the accuracy that may be expected in calculating temperatures from such a mapThe temperature at any depth may be calculated from the map by the following relationship.Formula available in full paperThe addition of more recent data confirms the gradient map presented by E.A Nichols as being quite accurate in the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast regions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Flickinger(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-61-064,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Well-bore damage in a drilling well is often responsible for misleading results from a drill-stem test (DST) of potential producing zones. Because conventional stimulation methods cannot feasibly be used during a test, a technique has been developed that utilizes a solid-fuel propellant to displace well-stimulating fluids into a formation at high rates and pressures under well conditions The drill pipe may be left essentially free of liquids so that a post-treatment drill-stem test may be conducted without removing the drill pipe or test tool from the well. Field-test results demonstrate that potentially productive formations can be evaluated more conclusively if the stimulation- drill-stem test procedure is used.INTRODUCTIONDrill-stem testing is an accepted method of evaluating the productivity of potential. Testing the formation before casing is set often results in substantial savings in money and time in both exploratory and field-development wells. However, drill-stem test results gave frequently been misleading as to the potential producing capacity of the zone being testedOften these erroneous test results are caused by well-bore damage that occurs during drilling operating In some cases, it is not feasible to conduct a drill-stem test on shallower zones until the well is drilled to a much greater depth. Invasion of the zone by water filtrate from the drilling mud during this time may so reduce its permeability that the DST results are inconclusive This possibility has long been recognized1,2,3Other investigators have shown that some formations are water-sensitive and several days testing would be necessary before representative formation fluids would be produced4Thus when DST results are negative, the operator is uncertain whether the zone is actually barren or whether well-bore damage prevented formation fluid recovery, Thus, a method of determining the undamaged formation producing capacity and fluid content will greatly increase the value and dependability of drill-stem test resultsA discussion of the development and field testing of a technique whereby potentially productive zones may be hydraulically fractured, acidized , or otherwise stimulated beyond the zone of well-bore damage during a drill-stem test is presented in this paper.DEVELOPMENT PHASEThe adaptation of formation stimulation to drill-stem testing, without using surface pumping equipment, required a down-the-hole power source, The use of a solid propellant fuel to generate gas at a controlled rate offered a solution to the problem A series of test was conducted to determine the nature of the pressure-volume-time relationship of gases generated by a solid propellant fuel. In addition, tests were needed to determine if this type of energy could be used as a power source to expel a required quantity of treating liquid at a sufficient pressure and rate to fracture a formation or displace acid into a formation under reservoir conditions.Ammonium nitrate in a rubber matrix was selected as the propellant for testing. An available propellant charge carrier which incorporated an annular-ring gas-generation chamber and an unobstructed passage through the tool was adoptedTo establish the characteristics of the solid propellant fuel and operability of the formation-stimulation technique",,American Petroleum Institute

Ladley(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-61-071,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Cement-lined pipe was used for lead lines in the North and South Burbank Units as the most economical method of preventing corrosion. New welding procedures were developed for joining the pipe. Special X-Pando was used to protect the weld from internal corrosion. Cracking of the cement lining was reduced by using end caps on the pipe to prevent the lining from drying out. Surge chambers were developed ant1 installed at the well heads to reduce pressure surges that caused corrosion failure behind lining cracks. Trucking and field-handling methods were studied and tested. Cement-lining methods, cement curing, cement composition, and reasons for defective cement linings were investigated. The oil industry needs more information and better cement linings. The National Association of Corrosion Engineers has recently done some work on this problem, and has prepared recommended practices for cement-lined pipe.INTRODUCTIONCement-lined steel pipe is used to contain corrosive fluids under pressure. The cement prevents corrosion of the steel pipe. The steel pipe is necessary to contain the pressure. The primary reason for its use is that it costs less than other materials which could be used to solve the corrosion-plus-pressure problem.This paper is limited to a discussion of experience with cement-lined pipe in surface pipelines between pumping oil wells and their tank batteries. This experience was obtained in two water-flood projects - North Burbank Unit and South Burbank Unit - in northeastern Oklahoma. It includes several hundred thousand feet of cement-lined pipe, in sizes from 2-in. through 13-in., which carry very corrosive well fluids. It does not include cement-lined pipe for fresh-water or saltwater injection.Practically no internal or external corrosion was experienced in any of the pipelines in these two water-flood project areas during primary production, or for the first 6 to 7 years of water-flood production. Then internal-corrosion failures in the unlined steel lead lines between the producing wells and the tank batteries rapidly became a major problem. These lines are laid on the surface and are joined by welding. The produced fluid is oil, salt water, and very small volumes of gas. Corrosive agents present are carbon dioxide, sulfate- reducing bacteria, and hydrogen sulfide produced by the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Oxygen content in the water is less than 0.4 parts per million. The exact mechanism of the corrosion, which is characterized by scattered sharp pitting, has not yet been determined. The penetration rate varies. In the worst areas it exceeds 1,300 mils per year. There appears to be no correlation between the location of severe corrosion damage and bacteria count, barium-sulfate content, or velocity of the produced fluid. The oil and salt water separate in the lead lines. Most of the pitting occurs in the lower half of the pipe in the water phase.Neither chemical inhibition nor bactericide in the surface lines was successful in preventing the corrosion. Surge pressures as high as 500 psi made the use of plastic or cement-asbestos pipe impossible. Tests of various plastic coatings in steel pipe were all unsuccessful.",,American Petroleum Institute

Arps2modified this approach to make it applicable for layers of varying thicknesses, rock, and fluid properties The Suder and Calhoun method3is similar in many respects to the modified Stiles2approach However, these investigators use the Yuster and Calhoun4method of predicting injectivity which is based on steady-state concepts. Refinements to the concepts presented by the aforementioned methods have been proposed by Dykstra and Parsons,5Johnson,6 Dyes and Braun,7Schmalz and Rahme,8Dyes et a1.9and more recently, Prats et a110The question arises as to which of these methods gives the best results and under what condition Also, how do these methods compare with an empirical method ?

Gravity effects are negligibleThe methods differ principally in the manner in which The injected fluid is apportioned among the layers and the treatment given sweep efficiency, flushing efficiency and mobility ratio Unfortunately, it appears probable that the first two assumptions may not be valid for most reservoirs, and the third assumption may not be valid In many depleted or semi-depleted oil sands",,American Petroleum Institute

In either injection or producing wells, flow profile serve several useful purposes. Well workovers can be facilitated through use of flow profiles to locate water and gas entry, tubing and casing leaks, and thief zones. Well completion and stimulation techniques can be evaluated.

Static and dynamic interface methods have proved to be time-consuming and costly. Specialized well-site equipment and personnel are required in addition to the usual logging personnel. Temperature-log interpretation is generally only semi-quantitative and the flow profiles obtained are poor in detail. Radioactive methods, in practice, are usually restricted to injection wells because of the problem of tracer disposal Success depends largely upon the skill of the logging operator and the technique used. Radioactive injection profiles are poor in detail, and radioactive deposition profiles are no more than questionably qualitative.

Armstrong(Jersey Production Research Co)|Keith Lovelace(Core Laboratories Inc.l presently with Texas Instruments),,,,,,API-61-104,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"A simple, sensitive, and reliable method of measuring the amount of invasion of core samples by water-base mud filtrate during coring has been developed. Essentially, the method consists of tagging the mud filtrate with tritiated water and determining the amount of tritium present in water retorted from the cores as they are processed in the core laboratory. Three experiments using this technique have been made and the results analyzed. Important advantages of the method over previously used methods are that the tracer is chemically the same as water and that it need not be extracted separately from the core nor measured while still in the core. The utility, ease of application, and versatility of the method have been demonstrated No attempt was made to evaluate the significance of data obtained during the development research. Use of the method in further studies should permit an investigation of the mechanics of core invasion.INTRODUCTIONIt is desirable that a core obtained from a petroleum reservoir be as representative as possible of the formation and its contained fluids. However, the process of cutting a core and bringing it to the surface exposes the core and it contained fluids to severe conditions which change the fluid content of the core. Thus, it is necessary to reconstruct the fluid state that existed originally In the reservoir The estimation of fluid saturations In a petroleum reservoir probably poses more difficult problem than any other phase of core analysisThe Industry generally recognizes that it is easier to obtain water-saturation data from a reservoir than to determine the amount of oil saturation. For this reason the estimated water saturation usually is used to obtain the oil saturation indirectly in the calculation of reserves.1The amount of water saturation is important because it reduces the pore space available to oil and gas and influences their recovery.Interstitial water generally is not uniformly distributed throughout the reservoir. The amount of saturation varies with pore size and, indirectly, with permeability, fluid characteristics, and height above the oil-water contact zone. Usually, there are two fairly well-defined zones in a petroleum reservoir. One is some distance above the oil-water contact where the residual water occupies a nearly constant percentage of the pore space. The other well-defined region is below the oil-water contact where the saturation may be considered to be 100 percent water. There is a transition zone between these two regions.Methods for Estimating Interstitial-water SaturationVarious methods are used to estimate original water-saturation values. Fluid contents of samples as recovered are commonly used as the bass for the estimate. Special drilling fluids are occasionally used to minimize alteration of the fluid contents during coring. Laboratory studies2-7 inclon extracted and restored core samples are frequently used. Various down-hole logs are sometimes used8All of these methods have some limitations. The laboratory capillary-pressure methods are commonly used to obtain an Irreducible or minimum water saturation, but certain conditions9 must be fulfilled before they can be used to estimate the distribution of interstitial water.",,American Petroleum Institute

The California Company's 20,000-bbl underwater oil-storage unit, which is the first of this type built in the petroleum industry, has been in full-scale field service since September 1960. The basic principles, layout, and facilities of this unique production facility are described. Problems arising in the planning, installation, and operation of this unit are also discussed.It is concluded that this method of storage is compara-able to conventional storage tanks in reliability, simplicity, and maintenance and has some definite advantages to conventional storage systems in mobility, salvability, and production-equipment rig-up expense. These features will enable operators, in many specific instances, to realize large savings in the cost of offshore production and storage of hydrocarbons.INTRODUCTIONAs the costs of finding and producing a barrel of oil are driven higher, the minimum amount of reserves that can be justifiably produced rises proportionally True everywhere in the oil industry, this fact is particularly relevant to offshore oil fields where drilling and production costs are many time higher than those of onshore fields. Because these costs will increase as oil fields are found in deeper water, farther from shore the costs of equipping and producing a field will be a proportionally larger factor in determining its overall economic attractiveness.In considering available methods of producing offshore wells, no one type of facility or system can be adapted to every field. Rather, new production methods may be required in order that the offshore operator can select a type most suited to the requirements of a specific field when the variables of water depth, distance to shore, type of transportation, daily production, field reserves, well characteristics,. etc.,. are considered.The major factor governing the selection of this type unit, in this instance, was the questionable length of the life of the field. The complex faulting and sharply dipping sands in this field, as well as its limited area, made the accurate determination of reserves impossible. In fact, the maximum reserve figure computed was many times the minimum estimated reserves. In terms of pears, at a normal depletion rate, the field was expected to last somewhere between 3 and 12 years. This fact made the salvability of production facilities the most important single criterion in the selection of the type system to be used. The total initial cost, although less than conventional facilities, was not considered as important as the amount of non-recoverable expenses, ie., the costs of installation and removal of facilities. The suitability of this mobile type of storage unit to these requirements overweighed the natural reluctance to invest a substantial amount of money in an unproved storage systemLOCATIONThe storage unit described is located in the Gulf of Mexico, Block 93, Eugene Island area, 30 miles offshore and 55 miles southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana.

This paper gives some rules-of-thumb that will help the producer determine which of his tank batteries are the best prospects for vapor recovery. Also given are the steps that should he followed to evaluate a specific applicationINTRODUCTIONSince early in its life , the oil Industry has recognized the importance of reducing the evaporation loss from crude oil and its products. Much progress has been made toward eliminating this loss through the use of vapor-tight storage tanks, conservation vent valves, and more efficient separation facilities Some companies have even established extensive evaporation-loss control programs to fight this problem The steps taken to minimize vapor losses from tanks are correct, and we are not talking about revising any of them with few exceptions, stock-tank vapors are more valuable sold as crude oil than as gas. It is estimated that the gas being vented each year from lease storage tanks In this country has a value of about 35 million dollars.On many leases it is profitable to recover tank vapors This is a popular subject at this time, and a good deal of attention has been given to the design and equipment aspect of vapor recovery However, there is very little information available on how to recognize where it is profitable to recover tank vapors. The purpose of this paper is to present some rules-of-thumb that will help the producer determine which of his batteries are the best prospects for vapor recovery and to give the steps to be taken to evaluate a specific application .The recovery of vapors from lease storage tanks has been practiced in California for many years It has been only within the last 5 or 6 years that producers in the Southwest have been recovering tank vapors for Injection into gasoline-plant gathering systems.

The ingenuity of the user and the availability of the many various parts have resulted In a situation in which numerous pump assemblies have been made available, each differing slightly from the other, not completely interchangeable. Simplification being In order, a task group was formed to study the problem and to propose a specification which would cover a number of basic pumps of various types and sizes.This paper introduces the new specification,API Std 11AX Specification for Subsurface Pump and Fit-tings,describes the basic pumps which are covered, and explains the numbering system.Use of the new specification should result in advantages to both the user and the manufacturer as a result of possible reduction of parts inventories, simplification of procurement of complete pump assemblies, and reduction of inventories of such assemblies.INTRODUCTIONSubsurface pumps and fittings, as discussed in this paper, include only sucker-rod pumps and their component parts for 2 3/8 in. OD and 27/8-in. OD API tubing.The need for API specifications for subsurface pumps and fittings was suggested at the Chicago meeting in 1953 in a paper presented by a user member of the Committee on Production Equipment.1In that paper, it was stated that the company had accomplished simplification by standardization and, as a result, the various pump assemblies in use throughout its organization had been reduced from 962 to 182 It was also stated that, in some cases, suppliers reported it was necessary to maintain a stock of as many as 3,500 to 4,500 parts and that these did not provide for all of the assemblies that could be specified.In 1954 a study committee was appointed to review the provisions ofStd 11A: Oil-well Pumps, and to submit recommendations for the further simplification of subsurface pumps by the elimination of obsolete and duplicate parts. At this same meeting, it was agreed that the rib-type seat was to be eliminated from the standard This, one of the first steps in simplification, reduced the number of possible pump assemblies by half Further simplification resulted in the elimination of duplicate thread specifications for valve rods, also duplicate thread specifications for pull tubes. Additional efforts to simplify the seating assembly failed, however, and dual standards continued to exist.Later, at the 1956 meeting of the Subcommittee on Pumps, the User Subcommittee presented a proposal for the standardization of subsurface pump assemblies and parts. Included in the proposal was a new numbering system for pump assemblies and pump parts. This proposal was discussed again at the 1957 meeting and at this meeting, as a result of the work of the study committee, it was agreed to eliminate the dual standards for threads of RL (rod-liner barrel) and RW (thin-wall barrel) pumps.The present Task Group on Standard Subsurface Pumps",,American Petroleum Institute

This fluid is injected first to create the desired fracture area. It leaks into the formation, plasters the fracture walls \nth filter cake, and thus limits further fluid leak-off. Fluid which carries the aluminum particles can be injected later with very little leak-off. Hence, the concentration of aluminum in the fracture will be essentially equal to the concentration injection into the well.The fracture made by the leak-off control spearhead may not be wide enough to accept aluminum pellets. However, studies have shown that a crack wide enough to accept aluminum pellets can be created by injecting a viscous fluid into the fracture ahead of the pellets For a sparse distribution of pellets, the particles must be suspended in a thick carrying fluid regardless of fracture orientation. Heavily gelled oils, gelled water, and thick water-in-oil emulsions have been used successfully as carrying fluids There should be no overflush during an aluminum-propping treatment. Any overflush will substantially reduce the conductivity near the well bore, and this will result in much poorer results from the fracturing job.To reduce costs and still achieve desired stimulation, sand often can be used in conjunction with aluminum In such cases, the treatment must be designed to place both aluminum and sand properly in the fractureINTRODUCTIONWithin the last few years, several investigators have shown that the full potentla1 of hydraulic fracturing not always realized1-5,1nc1Their work suggests that In many past fracturing jobs, low fracture-flow capacities have limited the benefits that were obtained. Hence, there has recently been a great deal of interest In methods for increasing fracture-flow capacities.6,7,8Recently the use of aluminum pellets to prop hydraulic fractures was described.9This previous paper discussed some laboratory tests and a few field tests which showed that highly conductive fractures could be achieved by propping with aluminum particles. Since that time, additional field tests have been performed by several companies with encouraging results.10In this paper, there will be discussed some of the concepts, techniques, and design methods that have been developed for the aluminum propping process. The discussion will fall into the following four categories: I , fracture conductivities that can be achieved with aluminum pellets; 2, techniques for correctly placing the particles in the fracture; 3, use of aluminum in conjunction with sand and 4, designing the treatment.FRACTURE CONDUCTIVITIESIf a fracture is packed with a granular material such as sand, the conductivity (flow capacity) of the fracture is the product of the crack width and the permeability of the propping material However, it has been found that a sparse distribution of propping material (i.e ,less than a full single layer) will often give a very substantla1 increase in fracture conductivity. This is shown conceptually in Fig1 . The width of the sparsely propped crack",,American Petroleum Institute

Howard(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-61-145,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Experimental and analytical data are presented showing That the limited fluid-carrying capacity of hydraulically created fractures restricts productivity improvements that would otherwise result from using specially designed large-volume, high injection-rate treatments.The inherent low crushing strength of sand requiring a high concentration per unit area of the fracture to support the overburden resulted in lower than desired fracture capacity in well regardless of the sand size used. To overcome these limitations, special high-strength metallic propping agents possessing strengths many times greater than sand have been developed . Substituting special high-strength propping materials for sand will result in high fracture-to -formation flow capacity contrast and significantly increase post-fracturing productivity.INTRODUCTIONField evidence indicates that post-treatment productivity of hydraulically fractured wells is governed primarily by the limited fluid capacity and areal extent of the created fracture system. Additional evidence that fracture capacity and areal extent are the governing factor in well productivity is provided by the limestone reservoirs in Iran Baker1describes instances where one well was produced at sustained rates of 30,000 to 40,000 bbl of oil per day with the well penetrating less than 10ft to tight, low-porosity limestone. This phenomenal production rate was the result of open fissures varying in clearance from 0 025m to 0.1 m and extending continuously throughout the producing reservoir. Another example cited is the Haft-Kel Field, Iran, also having intrinsic open fissures, which was produced for many years at an average rate of 10,000 bbl of oil per day per well even though the limestone permeability ranged from 0.01 to 10 md and porosity averaged about 75 percent. The fissured reservoirs of the Middle East demonstrate that the ultimate objective of hydraulic fracturing should be to convert a reservoir into a fissured formation having a high fracture-to-formation flow contrast.Because lithological and structural conditions in most Producing reservoirs in the United States are quite different from those described for the Middle East fields, it has been necessary to create the fracture system hydraulically and prevent the fracture from closing through use of mechanical props. Although extensiveopen fissuresare not attainable in most reservoirs, it should be possible to more nearly approach the fluid-carrying capacity of this type fissure than is being achieved with currently used propping agents and fracturing techniquesThis investigation involved determining analytically and experimentally the relationship that exists between the productivity that may be attained after fracturing and the fracture areal extent, well depth, fracture capacity, and concentration and type of propping agent. The prime objective of this work was to devise propping materials and fracturing techniques that will effect high fracture-to-formation flow capacity contrasts, thus resulting in considerably higher well productivities than are possible with conventional treatments.METHOD OF INVESTIGATIONExperimental ProcedureIn order to determine the relative performance of various propping materials and their effect on fracture flow capacity, a series of laboratory studies were conducted using the following procedure.Twenty-ton hydraulic rams were assembled in a framework so that pressure could be applied to short cylindrical formation core sections with plane surfaces.",,American Petroleum Institute

Ladley(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-61-152,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1961,"Some corrosion-cracking failures have occurred in oil-well tubing exposed to hydrogen sulfide where the mechanism of failure was determined to be sulfide-stress cracking. Most corrosion-cracking failures have occurred in condensate wells where identification of the causative agent was not possible. Mechanical damage and residual stresses have been contributing factors Stress-corrosion cracking, sulfide-stress cracking, and hydrogen embrittlement all appear to be involved in the corrosion cracking experienced. Failures can best be avoided by controlling the hardness of materials for sour service, by minimizing mechanical abuse, and by using the lowest-strength materials possible when completing high-pressure wells.INTRODUCTIONFailure of oil-well tubular products is not new to Anyone in producing operations. Some failures have Been so spectacular that they have received national news coverage. The recent loss of an offshore platform, all the equipment, and several lives is a prime example of this. A high-pressure gas well flowing wild always attracts a great deal of attention in the surrounding area.No one wants to lose property, lives, or reserves in his operations. Regardless of how well operations are planned, there is always the unknown; and as a result, failure do occur. By understanding the cause of failures progress can be made toward the ultimate foal of their eliminationRole of Failure AnalysisThe importance of failure analysis cannot be over-emphasized when dealing with tubular-goods failures This analysis might only be a visual examination of the failure in very simple cases. Usually, a detailed metallurgical study is necessary to accurately define the cause of failure. In many cases, one failure does not give enough information to answer all the question in the engineer?s mind, and either a large number of failure studies are need or a long-term research project is required to define the causeThe multiplicity of failure modes is what makes failure analysis so important. At first glance there does not seem to be anything complicated about deciding whether a failure was mechanical or the result of corrosion. But when one looks at the number of variables under each type, the problem becomes complex. Mechanical failure can result from excessive loading in tension, in burst, or in collapse. It can result from manufacturing defects, poor design, field-introduced notched, or from just plain handling abuse. Corrosion failures can occur by many different mechanisms-general metal loss, corrosion-erosion, corrosion-fatigue cracking, pit-ting, ringworm attack , stress-corrosion cracking, sulfide-stress cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, and others.Incidence of Cracking FailureImprovements in the metallurgy of tubing alloys, in handling equipment and practices, in inspection methods and in production techniques have minimized mechanical failures in recent years. This is shown quite emphatically by the type of failures experienced by Phillips Petroleum. Co. Fig 1 shows mechanical vs Corrosion failures up to 1961 From 1946 to 1954, 13 mechanical failures were recorded- there were no Corrosion-cracking failures. From 1954 to 1961, only 8 mechanical failures. The decrease in mechanical failures occurred even though the footage of high-strength tubular goods in service was much higher during the latter period",,American Petroleum Institute

Three chemicals are recommended for preparing solutions with densities up to 14 Ib per gal: sodium chloride, 8.3 to 9.8 lb per gal; calcium chloride, 8.3 to 11 5 lb per gal; and calcium chloride - zinc chloride, 11.5 to 14.0 lb per gal. These solutions have been used In numerous field installations.Problems associated with the use of dense brines are also examined. Corrosion considerations, storage and handling hints, safety aspects, and mixing techniques are discussed. Nomographs are given showing the material requirements for preparing the various solutions .Corrosion problems which were encountered when nitrates were used In packer fluids are surveyed. Both field and laboratory results have shown conclusively that nitrates should not be used In packer fluids, alone or in mixtures.INTRODUCTIONDuring the last few years, oil companies have been buying increasingly large tonnages of certain inorganic salts for use in oil wells. The salts are used alone or in mixtures to prepare high-density solutions to be used during completion of oil or gas wells and as a packer fluid during subsequent production. Proper use of these solutions can and has resulted in cleaner completions with fewer production problems. However, as In many other operations, improper use will simply compound existing problems.Continental Oil Company became involved In the development of the use of these solutions at an early stagel.2Since then, much has been learned about the chemical nature of some of these solutions and about. the difficulties in obtaining high densities. The purpose of this report is to summarize certain practices and to point out some pitfalls for those considering the use of these materialsThe use of salt brine for packer fluids is not new. In the last 2 or 3 years, however, a demand has arisen for densities greater than the 9 8 lb per gal available from a saturated sodium-chloride solution. This demand was primarily in the South Louisiana and offshore areas, and most of the use of high-density brines to date has been there Continental's experience has been predominantly offshore, and this paper will be confined to that phase. However, most of the data, ideas, and precautions will apply similarly to onshore operations.The primary requirement of this fluid is that it be capable of containing the formation pressure by hydrostatic head. The reasons for using a solution are: 1, to provide a clean particle-free medium for the completion operations; and 2, to have a nonsettling , nonsolidifying fluid in the tubing-casing a annulus during the productive life of the well. Experience has shown that 3 systems are best-suited for this purpose - sodium chloride (NaC1) ,8 3 to 9 8 lb per gal, calcium chloride (CaC12), 8 3 to 11 5 Ib per gal; and calcium chloride- zinc chloride (CaCl2-ZnCl), 115 to 140 lb per gal",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper reviews and discusses the field practices for care and handling which the operator should follow if the maximum effective performance is to be developed by the tubular goods. Less than the best care and handling practices at the drilling rig may waste much of the effort and expenditure of providing good and adequate tubular goodsINTRODUCTION,/b&gt;Interest in high-strength tubular goods has grown rapidly since 1950 because of the great increase each year in the number of deep wells drilled by the oil and gas industry. The use of high-strength tubular goods has been motivated by several factors , viz:They are generally more economical in deep wells P-110 casing costs 25 percent more than N-80. However, its collapse pressure is 45 percent higher than N-80; its internal pressure at minimum yield strength is 37 percent higher; and its API joint strength is 31 percent higher Beyond this, its widespread use in a casing string would reduce the weight of the string considerably,resulting in lower tensile loads for the upper sections to carry, thus compounding the savings resulting from improved strength.They reduce the wall thickness required, increasing pipe inside diameter and thereby improving clearance.in some cases they provide the necessary strength which lower grades cannot provide regardless of other economic and operating considerations.The user of high-strength tubular goods must give Greater consideration to the care, handling, and inspection of high-strength tubular goods than has been given to the lower gradesHigh-strength pipe is more costly, and is generally use in wells which are more costly to drill. The economic loss resulting from poor performance of high-strength pipe would be much greater than with the lower grades Further, the loads are much greater and usually the design factors are lower in deeper wells.If follows , then, that greater care must be exercised if poor performance is to be kept at the same low incidence level as has been experienced with the lower grades of tubular goodsCare, handling, and inspection are costly operations and should be done in such a fashion as to provide the operator the highest return on the investment made in them. It is not enough to say the practices are better They must be of such a nature that they will be reflected in improved performance. This is especially true in the case of some exotic inspection methods which may reject large amounts of product which have given satisfactory performance in the past, for it is axiomatic that the user will ultimately bear the cost of all the product which must be scrapped.Inasmuch as the performance requirements of casing and tubing are very unlike drill pipe, these products will Be considered separately herein.CASING AND TUBINGCasing and tubing are generally expected to contain internal pressure without leaking or bursting,carry high external pressure without collapsing",,American Petroleum Institute

Has industry misjudged the importance of these skills to the success of an enterprise ? In the final analysis, what have these skills to do with the per-barrel cost of producing crude oil, developing an electronic computer, or getting a thousand automobiles off the end of an assembly line ? it could be said that improved administrative and human-relations skills meant nothing to industry technology were the only factor influencing business success. However, in the American economy this is not the case.In a competitive economy such as ours, the most successful business enterprise in any competing group is the one with superior technology coupled with superior administrative ability and employee performance The corollary is that the successful business which perpetuates its success is the one that continues to develop both its technology and the level of its employees? efficiency. In answer to the question What has the development of administrative and human-relations skills to do with the success of an enterprise? it is as simple as this : it can mean the difference between a stagnant and failing business or one that is a dynamic, aggressive, and successful competitor.The people in an organization who are responsible for organization planning or assigned the task for college recruitment know only too well that major industries are recruiting for the same high-caliber college graduate and, in many instances, are interviewing and offering jobs to the same graduates. As all industries are competing in the same labor market, over period of time each of them, within reason , will secure its fair share of the college graduate with the highest indicated potential.Although organizations are staffed from this common pool, there is a wide variation in the degree of success achieved.

Daly(Sunray DX Oil Co),,,,,,API-62-140,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1962,"This paper demonstrates the .application of a deep ground bed (1,000 ft.) for casing cathodic protection. Several ground beds of this nature have been used successfully in the cathodic protection of pipelines and surface equipment. However, this is the first attempt to control external casing corrosion with a ground bed located in the corrosive zone.The results obtained at this time illustrate the advantages which had been theorized - corrosion is controlled with a minimum of electric current and operating expense. Actual protection efficiency has not been measured, but field surveys correlate with anticipated equipment performance. Early equipment failures are also discussed.INTRODUCTIONSevere external casing corrosion has been apparent for years in the West Kansas area -more precisely through the Dakota sandstone, a large water-bearing reservoir. New casing has been known to fail within a year and repair costs average $5,000 per failure. Inasmuch as casing corrosion protection is a relatively new field and has frequently shown poor results, the majority of the wells drilled in this area are still without protection of any kind.A cathodic-protection program study indicated that conventional ground-bed designs have three major disadvantages :Poor current distribution along the casing string. The conventional rectifier - ground-bed system involves burying numerous sacrificial or non-sacrificial anodes about 100 ft. from the well head and some 10 ft. to 20 ft. deep. It is from these anodes that current is supplied to the casing. However, corrosion usually occurs opposite water-bearing formations located at a remote distance from the ground bed. Logically a large amount of current is ineffective in the protection of the corrosive areas.High top-soil resistances during dry seasons result in over-design of equipment and expensive electric-power bills or insufficient current densities.Interference with surface equipment. Because the immediate ground-bed area is highly corrosive to all structures not electrically connected to the system, it is always time-consuming and expensive to locate and protect all buried equipment in the vicinity of the anodes.The logical solution to these three problems is to locate the ground bed in the Dakota water, approximately 1,000 ft. deep.THEORY AND DEFINITIONSExternal casing corrosion occurs whenever inherent potential differences exist along the surface of the metal, and this pipe is in contact with an electrolyte. The amount of corrosive attack is then directly proportional to the degree of the potential differences and the relative electric conductance of the electrolyte. When rapid casing failures occur, large amounts of electric current are known to flow from the casing to the adjacent soil. The principle of cathodic protection is simply to apply sufficient electric current from an external source to the corroding metal and force the current flow to reverse its path, thereby eliminating all corrosion.1Investigation of electric-current flow resulting from these potential differences further indicates that two main types exist, viz., long-line currents and localized currents. Although long-line currents are readily reversed, the latter type requires a considerably larger current density from an external source.",,American Petroleum Institute

Performance of the Johnson J sand reservoir project, which has utilized the gas-driven slug process, indicates that miscible flooding may be used successfully and economically as an improved method of secondary recovery in water-drive reservoirs. Oil recovery will be substantially increased in spite of early breakthrough of both gas and propane. It is estimated that recovery efficiency in the swept zone will approach 80 percent of the oil in place. Overall reservoir recovery will be approximately 64 percent of the original oil in place compared to the estimated primary recovery of 45 percent by natural water driveINTRODUCTIONMiscible phase displacement - or more simply, miscible flooding - has received considerable attention during the past few years as a method of secondary oil recovery. The results of a number of field trials, both pilot and full-scale, have been reported in the literature. 1-5.i Although many of these papers discuss the results of miscible-flooding techniques in reservoirs which have had a primary history of solution-gas depletion, very little data have been presented describing the results of miscible flooding in reservoirs having an active water drive as a primary producing mechanism. Many of the fields in Cheyenne County, Nebraska, may be classified in the latter category. Some of these fields are highly undersaturated. This condition, together with the maintenance of reservoir pressure above the bubble point by an active aquifer, results in lower recoveries than would be realized -if the solution gas were effective as an additional source of energy. The small size of some of these reservoirs has made it possible to evaluate the feasibility of miscible flooding as a method of recovering additional oil from water-drive reservoirs. This paper presents the results of miscible flooding by means of the gas-driven slug process in the J sand reservoir of the Johnson Field, Cheyenne County, Nebraska. In addition to describing the use of such a process in a waterdrive reservoir as a means of secondary recovery, it is possible that some light may be shed on its use as a method of tertiary recovery in fields which have already experienced secondary depletion by water flooding.DEVELOPMENT HISTORY AND GENERAL RESERVOIR CHARACTERISTICSThe Johnson Field (Fig. 1) is located approximately 9 miles northeast of the city of Sidney, Nebraska, and occupies parts of Sect. 3, T. 14N., R. 49W., and Sect. 35, T. 15N., R. 49W., in Cheyenne County.

Kollehner(Marathon Oil Co),,,,,,API-62-152,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1962,"The continuous spinner survey is one of many methods used to evaluate fluid movement in wells, in particular water-injection wells. The survey was developed to overcome deficiencies inherent in the conventional stop-type spinner survey and to provide a continuous profile of fluid movement in the well bore. The continuous spinner survey is obtained by continuous movement of the spinner tool at a constant rate against the direction of fluid flow. Thus, the initial inertia of the impeller is overcome and any incremental change in flow velocity causes a corresponding change in impeller rotation. The rotation of the impeller (rpm) is continuously recorded at the surface vs. depth, thus providing a complete picture of fluid movement in the well bore.The basic theory of spinner-tool behavioral and spinner tool calibration curves is discussed, with the intent of providing a better understanding of the methods of interpreting continuous spinner surveys. The interpretation of the surveys essentially resolves into locating zero and 100 percent flow and interpolating between these values to determine the percentage flow at any particular point. In conclusion, a field procedure for setting up a spinner program is offered as a guide to obtaining better continuous spinner surveys.THE CONTINUOUS SPINNER SURVEYThe spinner tool has been used effectively for a number of years to determine fluid-flow in both producing injection wells. Recently, the tool has been made more effective by tile development of the continuous surveying technique. The continuous survey was developed to eliminate a major problem encountered in conventionally survey - the of which is the flow rate required to cause a spinner tool to rotate. The bypass call be understood by reviewing method in whicI1 a conventional stop-type spinner survey is run. this survey tile tool is suspended in a water-injection well. The injection rate is determined by reading from the calibration curve the flow rate equivalent to the rate a t which the impeller turns (rpm). By similarly the tool at various points in tile interval, the flow rate at these points is determined, and subsequently a profile of the fluid injection is determined. As the tool is lowered to that point where the rate drops to the bypass rate, it stops spinning. The profile below that point cannot be evaluated by this survey method. If the total injection rate was less than the bypass, the entire profile could not be evaluated. The continuous spinner surveying technique was developed to eliminate the bypass problem and to evaluate these unknown injection profiles. The evaluation was accomplished by continuously moving the tool against the direction of flow at a constant velocity sufficient to cause the impeller to spin even in stationary fluid. With the inertia of the impeller thus overcome, even the slightest flow would cause the impeller to spin faster; thus the entire injection profile could be determined.BASIC THEORY OF SPINNER SURVEYSThe spinner tool is an instrument for measuring flow velocity of a fluid. The tool consists of a rotating element or impeller and a device for measuring its rate of rotation.",,American Petroleum Institute

The following possible reasons for such an occurrence have been investigated and/or studied:1 ,Poor sampling;2,Washburn- Bunting porosity measurements are high;3,porosities determined from flood-pot measurements are low; or4,is it size of samples?Washburn-Bunting porosity measurements made by one laboratory were found to be comparable to measurements made by other laboratories using the Horner, sand-grain density, Stevens, liquid-saturation, Boyle's law, and Washburn-Bunting methods. Also, measurements of porosities from flood-pot data are comparable to other reliable methods. Consequently, the size of the samples used is believed to be a factor in the reliability of porosity measurements.Statistical studies involving 798 wells (7,914 flood pot samples and 16,000 plug samples) were made to determine the effect on total effective saturation (ratio of flood-pot to conventionally measured porosities) of area, formation, area and formation, depth, permeability, porosity, and total liquid saturation. The principal objective of this study was to develop reliable correlations for adjusting routine porosity values most often available. The authors believe this can most effectively be performed usingtotal effective saturation as a pore volume adjustment factor. Correlations were found between total liquid saturation and total effective saturation in the flood-pot samples. The total effective saturation increased as the total liquid saturation increased. Appreciable variations also were found between the average total effective saturations of different formations in the same field and for the same formation in different pools.Using typical rock and fluid properties and other data, studies were made to determine the effect of incorrect porosities on fill-up volume, initial oil in place, and water-flood recovery estimates. Depending upon rock and fluid properties, it was found that a 10-percenterror in porosity can result in a 25- to 100 +-percent error in water-flood recovery estimates, 3- to 50-percent error in fill-up volume estimates, and 12- to 25-percent error in original oil-in-place estimates.The direct applicability of the pore-volume adjustment factor is illustrated by several case histories of nearly depleted water floods. In each of these, complete core-analysis data were available for practically all wells.INTRODUCTIONTwenty years ago the writers1first experienced difficulty in successfully applying saturation data based on conventional porosity determinations in volumetric water-flood calculations.

First, the sand is flushed with an agent to condition the sand-grain surfaces for good adhesion to resin. Then a solution is injected from which resin precipitates after 1 hour at formation temperature. Finally, several barrels of diesel fuel are injected to assure that the well bore proper is cleared of resin solution. Laboratory tests show that sands treated with this process have compressive strengths of approximately 1,000 psi and retain 50 percent of their original permeability.Treatment of a well with this procedure is simple. The chemical solutions are prepared at the well site and pumped into the formation by conventional pump trucks. The process has been tested in many wells. Formations ranging in temperature from 100 F to 204 F and in depth from 1,790 to 8,496ft have been treated with remarkable success.INTRODUCTIONIt is likely that the exclusion of sand from wells became a problem with the digging of the first water well. Certainly, it has been a matter of concern to the oil industry since production was first established in the coastal regions of Texas, Louisiana, and California. The earliest approach to sand control was the use of mechanical means, and devices such as screens and gravel packs are still in wide use. However, such methods have never been a fully satisfactory answer to the problem, particularly for wells in which the productive sand is fine or silty. Screens cut out, and both screens and gravel packs are susceptible to plugging.The search for a better method of sand control began about 20 years ago, and by 1946 the feasibility of consolidating loose formation sands with injected plastic had been demonstrated.1The technique has been used extensively in recent years, for it offers many advantages over other methods of sand control.2,3,4The many successfully treated wells have shown that the consolidation is usually permanent, and well or formation plugging occurs very rarely. Originally somewhat more expensive to apply than the more conventional methods, plastic sand consolidation today is competitive in cost with other techniques. The versatility of the method has greatly enhanced benefits derived from some of the newer trends in well completion. For example, small diameter casing is hardly practical if the productive formation must be screened or gravel-packed. Similarly,these approaches are not very feasible in the upper zones of multiple completions. On the other hand, the injection of plastics is especially adapted to these situations. With today's need for reducing costs associated with the production of oil and gas, sand consolidation has become an important factor in the industry's operations.",,American Petroleum Institute

Many approaches to its solution have produced a wide range of preventive aids and remedial procedures. Many are eminently successful, but the cost may be prohibitive when marginal wells are considered. The need for a low-cost, effective method to help prevent sand production is now being met with a novel screen design which is not only inexpensive, but also easily installed.Previous experience with the effectiveness of pressure-packed sand packs suggested that a consolidated layer of sand of the proper size, interposed between the incompetent producing zone and the tubing string, would possess many of the advantages of sand packs and at the same time offer a simple means of installation without the need for highly specialized equipment.DESIGN CONSIDERATIONSThe design of the sand screen consists essentially of an outer cylinder of resin-consolidated sand bonded to a slotted mandrel. Sand was chosen over other materials as a screening medium because of its compatibility with all formations. Sand is also ideal since it is inert to most well and treating fluids. By using a material bonded together with a high-strength resin, it is not necessary or desirable to add a metal cover to the screen for protection while running it in the well. This has a decided advantage over other types of screens in that, if the screen becomes sanded in and the consolidated sand strips from the tubing when it is pulled, there should not be any metal junk left in the hole that must be drilled out. If there is any mechanical damage to the screen as a result of its dragging against the casing going in the hole, the screening effectiveness will not be reduced so long as the slots are not uncovered. This is possible because the screen is of uniform permeability and the screening is the same throughout the screen rather than only at a single point of entry.The development of this new screen design was preceded by a study of the down-hole conditions which are encountered in many sand-problem wells. A back-log of over 300 formation-sand sample analyses, plus a survey of producing zones in a representative section of the Gulf Coast area were the two principal subjects of investigation.Examination of the particle-size distribution (sieve analysis) and clay content of 83 formation-sand Samples",,American Petroleum Institute

Rasmussen(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-62-182,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1962,"Shell Oil Company, in Texas and New Mexico, has experienced results from an improved well-stimulation method called limited-entry treatment. This treatment is accomplished by: 1, limiting the number of perforations in a well; and 2, providing injection rates sufficient to require the restricted flow capacity of the perforations to divert the treatment to a greater portion of the perforated interval. This method has proved more effective than any other in diverting treating fluids to multiple horizons.From December 3, 1960, to January 1, 1962, Shell Oil Company has treated 201 wells by this technique. The initial production performance of wells treated by limited- entry completions is superior to that of conventionally treated wells. Gamma ray tracer logs indicate most of the pay is being treated even though not covered by perforations. The limited-entry technique. has been successfully used in treating two separate reservoirs simultaneously in dually completed wells. Results of these simultaneous treatments have been gratifying both in well performance and in reduced costs.GENERAL REVIEW OF MULTIPLE-ZONR TREATMENTConventional Treatment TechniquesThe efficient simultaneous treatment of multiple porous intervals in a reservoir has been a long-standing problem in well stimulation. Various methods have been used to treat multiple zones, with greater or lesser degrees of effectiveness. The bridge plug and packer method is effective, but is relatively expensive. Further, the injection rates are considerably reduced, and this method is sometimes mechanically hazardous. Temporary plugging agents to divert the treatment have been used with apparent success. The main disadvantage of temporary plugging agents, such as moth balls or gel blocks, is the difficulty in determining the proper quantity of agent required to divert the treatment. Ball sealers are often ineffective because of : 1, fluid communicating behind the casing between closely spaced perforations; 2, failure of the balls to seat on the perforations; and 3, abrasion of the ball sealers allowing fluid to bypass.Limited-entry TechniqueShell Oil Company, in Texas and New Mexico, has experienced excellent results from an improved well-stimulation method called limited-entry treatment. Based on data obtained to date, this method is much superior to the other methods of obtaining simultaneous treatment of multiple zones. The treatment is performed by :1 limiting the number of perforations in a well; and 2, providing injection rates sufficient to require the restricted capacity of the perforations to divert the treatment to a greater portion of the perforated interval.The first limited-entry treatment in this region was performed in Shell TXL M-3 (TXL-Tubb Field), Ector Country, Texas, following a review of a paper by W.B.Murphy and A..

No. mechanical difficulties have been encountered that can be attributed to this method of treatment. Of the treatments performed to date, 94 percent were successful, without sanout This is considered to be a normal success ratio.

Thompson(Humble Oil Refining Company),,,,,,API-62-191,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1962,"Selection of the most effect we perforation method in an oil or gas well is primarily based on comparative laboratory tests of various perforators. Since the physical characteristics of formation target materials exert a notable effect on both bullet and jet perforator performances, the oil industry needs a technically sound, simple method to predict the performance of each device under known well conditionsThis paper defines penetration and hole character variations as a function of the compressive strength of the rock and sets forth a calculation procedure to determine the penetration in a producing horizon from the measured formation compressive strength.INTRODUCTIONIt has been known for some time that formation physical properties are among the factors influencing the performance of perforating tools. Test observations have shown that large variations in penetration occur as porosity, permeability, and compressive strength of formation materials vary. This in itself has created substantial problems in the testing and evaluation of perforators, requiring the expenditure of considerable effort in developing targets offering sufficient constancy for laboratory-testing purposes. These efforts have resulted in the extensive use of the Berea sandstone target, which is now being utilized as a test tool m conjunction with standardized laboratory procedures.However, because penetration varies with formation physical properties, Berea performance data serve the limited purpose of establishing relative gun performance under controlled laboratory conditions. This paper will show that Berea data do not directly define, or necessarily even approximate, the performance of the perforating device in producing horizons. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if perforator performance the Berea laboratory target could be related to performance in any given producing formation.In this paper, it is shown that a mathematical relationship exists between perforator performance and the formation compressive strength of target materials when the casing and cement properties remain constant In order to effectively utilize this relationship , a method is set forth by which the penetration in actual formations can be calculated from known well conditions and compressive strengths.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInitial ConsiderationsIn routine laboratory evaluations for comparing one gun with others, perforator testing has generally been confined to the Berea sandstone material now in extensive use Special studies have shown that penetration values In Berea targets for a given perforator vary In a direct relation with porosity and permeability of the material, and it has been further shown that this same effect can be expected with actual formations materials.1These published data show that better correlation was obtained using porosity when measuring penetration variations with porosity and permeability.The author confirmed this during study, but found that compressive strength offers better correlatability when considering the broad range of formations encountered2Table 1 lists the physical characteristics of oil-producing formations selected randomly from various fields. Because of the relatively narrow range of porosities In a large percent of the oil-bearing reservoirs, emphasis in this study has been placed on the effect of formation compressive strength on perforator-performance testing.Measurement and Testing",,American Petroleum Institute

I do not intend to under-rate for a moment the problems which have been troubling producers in this country for the past several years. But I am not going to dwell on them here -many other speakers at many other meetings have already done that job most thoroughly.Maybe I will be accused of playing Pollyanna, but I am going to spend most of the time talking about what looksgoodfor our industry, rather than what looks bad. The first point I want to make is one that you are already aware of, but which cannot be over-emphasized: It is that we are in along-rangebusiness The oil business is more than a 100 years old, and it could be good for a few hundred more Certainly, it is going to be a vigorous, expanding business for as long as any of us or our children - ortheirchildren - are going to be around.This is an obvious thing, maybe, but it is also easy to lose sigh of. It is just human nature to do most of our talking and worrying about the short run, about the here and now. Certainly, weshouldgive the present our principal attention; but not to the point where it obscures the larger picture for us, leads to defeatist thinking about our industry, and causes us to become discouraged or timid about the future.Now what is this larger picture? Notwithstanding our current problems, what do producers have to be happy about and to feel encouraged about?I would say we have two very important, world-wide influences to be happy about. One of these is what is politely known as the biological urge - the urge of people to producemorepeople. The second influence is the urge of people for a better, more comfortable, more satisfying kind of personal life - for a higher standard of living.These two human desires are the main reasons we can feel confident about the prospects for our industry as a whole and for oil and gas production in particular.Included herein are several graphs which forecast the effect of these human urges.

This paper presents laboratory data and case histories concerning the use of Tetrakis to shut off the water In such holes. Laboratory data determined the effects of the following variables on this water-shutoff technique:1, concentration of reagent;2,preflush volume;3,temperature;4, time; and5,flowing pressure differentials. The process was applied 16 times in a total of 13 air- or gas-drilled wells. Eight of these were unqualified successes; two were failures because of the nature of the formation. The remainder probably shut off the water in the section treated, but, because additional water production was exposed while drilling and not treated, no conclusive statements can be made.INTRODUCTIONBy using air or gas as the drilling fluid in rotary drilling operations, it is possible to reduce substantially the cost of drillingl,2.3by realization of much higher penetration rates and increased bit footage. When penetrated formations produce excessive amounts of water into the bore hole, the economy obtained with using air or gas may be lost or severely curtailed unless the water production is stopped. Various approaches4-8, inclhave been made in the past at stopping water production; each approach has its own advantage and disadvantage.None of the existing processes available for water shutoff seemed completely satisfactory; therefore, we defined for our needs the attributes that a good water shutoff process should have. These attributes are:The treatment should be liquid phase for ease and accuracy of placement in a well.The treatment should involve a single liquid injection for plugging action, thereby sirnplifying the treatment procedure and increasing the chances for a successful water-shutoff.The plug should be stable and long-lasting.Formation of a plug should be delayed to prevent premature blocking that would keep the treating liquids from entering the water-producing zone.The shut-in time after the treatment is injected into the formation should be reasonably short, inasmuch as the drilling-rig time costs are high.There should be no acid by-products from the reaction that forms the plug. This prevents solution of carbonate rock (limestone or dolomite) which, in turn, can decrease the effectiveness of the formed plug.A treatment should be possible with water initially in the well bore.The chemicals involved In the process should be safe for field personnel to handle.There should be no danger of sticking tools with the chemicals.Treatment costs should be reasonableA study to develop a water-shutoff process having the foregoing attributes was initiated.RESULTSA water-shutoff process was developed from laboratory tests and proved by field trials. It involves non-aqueous solutions of a liquid called Tetrakis Such solutions will react slowly with interstitial water in capillaries of a formation and likely form a tenacious mass of hydrated metal oxide, organic-metal condensate, and an alcohol.",,American Petroleum Institute

Considerable data-both original and from the literature-are presented to show some of the significant metallurgical variables involved in properties demanded in service. Sufficient data on the effects of notches, cyclical loads, corrosive environments, and impact loads are presented to make it possible for production engineers and specification writers to consider these design thinking. Overall, the clearly show that yield-strength designing is inadequate and unnecessarily limited in effectiveness for modern production engineering.INTRODUCTIONWhen one speaks of performance properties of materials, normally those listed as such in various specifications and handbooks are implied in reality, however, the truly significant performance properties are those involved in actual equipment failures. The fact that we design by properties listed, yet continue to have equipment failures. at least creates the suspicion that some pertinent differences exist.In this paper we intend to examine our design Philosophy to assess its pertinent features. It should then be possible to determine what is missing that results in failures. Once the weaknesses are revealed, we will be well on the road to effecting some solutions to our problems Discussion will be confined largely to three types Of equipment-sucker rods, tubular good and line pipe-inasmuch as failures in these three items represent a healthy portion of our equipment failure expenses.If one examines the various standards that limit the specification and design philosophy of production engineers - APIStd 5A, 5AX, 5LX,and11B-one would be led to believe that normal tensile failures were the only mechanism by which piping and sucker rods fall The properties and design criteria presented are essentially those obtained buy a standard tensile test, this results in a measure of the tensile strength, yield strength is given much credence in production design formulae.One would not object to these tensile-test-determined properties as exclusive design parameters if their sufficiency could be demonstrated Properties that are to be used effectively as design criteria must be either properties brought directly into play by the service condition or have some direct, consistent, and known relationship to all of the properties thatarebrought into play in service. Further, if equipment failures are to be avoided, the properties involved in the failures must form a significant part of the design criteria Let us examine the conditions under which our specification and design properties are obtained-the condition for which they would be directly applicable The standard tensile specimen is cut with uniform parallel sides with a relatively smooth surface.

This paper discusses procedures involved In calculating rates necessary to obtain turbulence and wellhead pressures and horsepower requirements resulting from these rates Laboratory tests necessary for determining fluid properties are discussed and the advantages of using additives to improve flow properties are pointed out The paper also discusses the desirability of attaining turbulent flow during the initial cementing job by evaluating several field case histories and results obtained on jobs where calculations indicated that turbulence was reached Limited data are shown on the comparison of the fluid properties of slurries mixed in the field and in the laboratory. Calculated wellhead pressures and horsepower requirements are compared to those actually attained on jobs in the field.INTRODUCTIONRenewed interest has been shown in attaining a higher success ratio in primary cementing jobs. Recent developments of materials which allow cement slurries to reach turbulence a t a reduced rate have stimulated new primary techniques This practice was advanced as early as 1948 by Howard and Clark1when it was shown that more efficient mud removal was attained by achieving turbulent flow of the slurry man annulus during a primary cementing operation. Because this work has been generally accepted, efforts have been expanded to reduce the flow rates necessary for turbulence with all cementing compositions buy use of dispersants and/or viscosity -reducing additives. With lower displacement rates and a corresponding decrease in pipe and annular friction, a significant reduction in ellhead pressure and hydraulic horsepower would be realized Laboratory data on fluid properties of slurries have been analyzed to indicate the desirability of adding dispersants to a cement blend to reduce slurry viscosity Limited data are available which indicate laboratory and field mixing data on fluid properties compare closely. A number of field case histories were evaluated where calculations indicated turbulent-flow rates were utilized. Jobs were evaluated where casing sizes from 2 7/8 through 9 5/8 in. were used. For purposes of evaluation,a turbulent-flow job was considered successful only where no block squeezing or other remedial work was necessary after perforating for production. On this basis, an overall success ratio of 87 percent has been realized on 30 wells considered In the survey.PROCEDURE FOR MAKING A HYDRAULIC ANALYSISHydraullc well-bore analyses are most commonly performed using the methods and equations described by Slagle2Factors required for these calculations include the properties of the fluids to be used in the system and dimension of the hydraulic system under consideration.Determination of Fluid PropertiesDensity, and the two fluid viscosity parametersn'(flow-behavior index) and K' (consistency index), are the fluid properties which must be determined for each of the fluids which will be present in the well bore These fluids include the drillng mud, cement slurry, and displacing fluid.

The gas contains 13 percent hydrogen sulfide and 5 percent carbon dioxide which results in a very corrosive environment. In addition to corrosion, equipment is especially susceptible to failure from hydrogen embrittlement because of the relatively high operating pressures Experience has shown that this combination of conditions can be controlled economically and safely. With a well-planned corrosion-lnhibition program standard, readily available materials can be used for most applications. Procedures can be establised for monitoring the condition of equipment that will forewarn of impending failure. This, In conjunction with a good safety program, will afford effective protection to operating personnel.INTRODUCTIONIn 1953, when the first well penetrated the Smackover lime In the New Hope Field, two important questions came to the minds of those involved. The first was: Will it produce? The second was: If it does produce, how severe will be the operational problems? Core analysis showed the formation was very tight, with porosity ranging between 5 and 8 percent and a composite average permeability of 0.12 md. The reservoir fluid contained 13 percent hydrogen sulfide and 5 percent carbon dioxide at a pressure of 6,000 ps1and a temperature of 275 F. The question of productivity was partially answered when acidizing Indicated that the meager flow rates from the initial drill-stem test could be improved. At the time there was very little industry experience to draw from to answer whether sour gas, at these pressures, could be safely and economically produced and processed. This would have to be determined by experimental work and In the field itself. Development drilling proceeded; and by 1957 the productive limits were substantially defined, covering some 3,200 acres. The structure 1s an anticline with a water level a t approximately 12,400 ft. Maximum productive thickness a t the crest 1s 600 ft. While drilling was going on, studies were made to determine the best method of recovery. These indicated that cycling would be necessary. In mid-1957 a pilot plant was constructed to evaluate the cycling possibilities and methods for controlling the sour gas. At this time, no provisions were made for removing the hydrogen sulfide. After stripping the condensate, the sour gas was Injected Into the reservoir. This plant operated until 1960. The data and experience received from it were justification for building a large-scale processing plant and gas-cycling facilities. The expanded facilities were put in operation in late 1960 with a plant inlet volume of 50 MMcf/D From this 1s recovered 6,700 bbl of condensate, 1,000 bbl of propane, 600 bbl of butane, and 200 long tons of sulfur. A residue gas volume of 30 MMcf/D remains, which 1s compressed to 6,000 psi and returned to the formation. The combination of sour gas, high pressures, deep wells, and thick productive section found by the discovery well in 1953 has presented some intriguing problems that s t a r t with the well completion and continue on to the injection of the sweet residue gas.",,American Petroleum Institute

This problem is prevalent In the majority of disturbed-belt locations where dipping-formation bedding planes, fractured and faulted formations, extremely hard sections, and hard and soft formation sequences exist. In many cases it is a combination of two or more of these conditions encountered In varying and often unpredictable sequences. In other cases it is localized to a specific area of operation, formation, or formations . Sometime crooked-hole problem are compounded by poor drilling and operating practices such as poor bit selection, improper weight and rotary speed, and over-extension of effective but life.The seventy of crooked hole is measured In the degree of dog legging encountered A maximum tolerable figure generally accepted by British American is 2 &frac12; to 3 deg, calculated on deviation and directional changes per 100ft of hole drilled . This figure has been arbitrarily set from field experience However, depending upon the degree of deviation and on certain formation characteristics and tendencies to keyseat or groove out from tool-joint erosion during trips, this limit may be somewhat varied from area to area depending on the exact conditions encountered.Deviation problem resulting In keyseating conditions, hole drag, and drill-string torquing culminating In fishing jobs and hole sloughing clue to drill-string erosion has been one of the major factors to overcome in assuring a successful drilling operation.CROOKED HOLEArea of Crooked-hole Incidence Although there are several areas in Canada where crooked-hole conditions exist , Fig 1 delineates the disturbed belt with references to the crooked-hole areas in which British American has been primarily engaged in drilling operations. This area generally encompasses that portion of southwestern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia where foothills and mountainous terrain prevails.The most westerly portion of the area is in the Paleozoic mountains while the central portion is in the Mesozoic foothills. The general structural trend of the foothills belt is north-northwesterly and is defined by a series of regional low-angle westerly dipping thrust faults extending from the mountains on the west to the interior plains on the east The general region of drilling activity ranges from these mountains to the plains and from the Montana border at the 49th Latitude to approximately the 54th Latitude In the north.Methods of Controlling Crooked HoleMethods used to date to combat and correct crooked-hole conditions include:Fig. 1 - Area of ~rooked-holeIn cadence (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

The laboratory procedure used was to emulsify oil Into the mud and then, at a pressure differential of 500 psr, measure the sticking coefficient between a steel plate and a mud filter cake deposited from the mud. Set time was allowed to increase until the sticking coefficient became nearly constant. Emulsification of oil in a mud reduced the sticking coefficient at all set times . The magnitude of this reduction in sticking coefficient Increased as the degree of emulsification of the oil increased At short set times , all oils emulsified to the same degree caused similar reductions in sticking coefficient. At long set times , certain viscous, but highly fluorescent oils caused much greater reductions in sticking coefficient than did kerosene. Addition of small amounts of an oil additive to a mud containing kerosene greatly reduced the long set time sticking coefficient without changing other mud properties. The material was non-fluorescent.The oil additive has been added to the mud systems of three wells which were being drilled with kerosene- oil emulsion mud In all cases the sticking coefficient was reduced, and other mud properties were unchanged. No difficulties were encountered in analyzing sidewall cores in the one field well where they were taken Stray fluorescence was not observed In zones known to be free of hydrocarbons, and no masking of fluorescence occurred in zones known to contain hydrocarbons. Thus, the addition of the material and kerosene to a mud system appears to be an effective means of reducing the incidence of differential-pressure sticking without introducing undue difficulties In formation evaluation.INTRODUCTIONDifferential-pressure sticking can occur when the drill string comes in contact with the wall of the bore hole in the presence of a high differential pressure into the formation. The severity of sticking depends upon the magnitude of this pressure differential, the area of contact between pipe and mud filter cake, and the friction which must be overcome to move the pipe Since Helmick and Longley1described the phenomenon an Outmans2presented a theoretical analysis of how differential-presented sticking may occur, many paper have been written suggesting various means of alleviating sticking3-15,inclDifferential pressure can be controlled only within narrow limits because of the necessity of keeping formation pressure under control. The area of contact may be reduced through use of drill-string stabilizers or through use of special drill collars. Use of several types of special drill collars has been reported3,4,The friction between pipe and mud properties5,6by adding special materials to mud7-10or by changing",,American Petroleum Institute

Presley(U.S. Atomic Energy Commision Las Vegas Nev),,,,,,API-63-087,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"During the past 18 months, several different drilling techniques (and variations thereon) have been utilized at the Nevada test site, and elsewhere, In the drilling of more than 90,000 ft. of holes having a cased diameter of 29 in. (drilled diameter 36 in . ) or greater. Approximately 30,000 additional feet of hole with drilled diameters of 26 in to 36 in have also been completed.All of the methods used have certain deficiencies -in equipment limitations , cost, time , or a combination of these; and certain combination of drilling conditions existing at the Nevada test site indicate that entirely new equipment and/or techniques must be developed if big holes are to be successfully drilled when these conditions exist.BACKGROUNDWith the resumption of nuclear testing in the fall of 1961, several methods of earth excavation were considered to enable testing to be carried out underground, where contamination of the atmosphere would be reduced to the vanishing point. Conventional mine shafts and/or tunnels were slow and expensive to construct. Therefore, the use of large-diameter drilled holes was adopted for emplacement of most nuclear devicesSince that time , about 120,000 ft. of holes with an open-hole diameter of 26 in, or greater have been drilled -more than 100 of them. By far, the greatest number of these holes have had cased diameters of 29 in or 36 In., requiring, respectively, drilled diameters of 42 in . and 48 in. Holes have been drilled as large as 64 in in diameter and to depths in excess of 8,500 ft. Program requirements have thus caused the Atomic Energy Commission to drill a large part of the big holes drilled to date in the United States.A great deal has been learned about drilling big holes. In the author's opinion, a great deal remains to be learned, both by the commission and by the drilling industry.TECHNIQUES OF DRILLINGIn the early stages of the current underground testing program, which began in September 1961, there was a great deal of pressure to test as rapidly as possible. This meant that many holes were required - in a hurry. Consequently, standard large oil-field rigs were acquiredand drilling commenced. There was no time for involved rig modifications except for changing the substructures to accommodate larger bits; and, in fact, the large bits were about the only change from conventional oil-field drilling. Mud was used for the circulating fluid and the holes were drilled in stages -usually with a 12 &frac14; -in. pilot hole, opened to total depth in successive stages to 26 in., 36 in., 42 in., and, if necessary, to 48 inMost of the holes were largely drilled in valley fill alluvium and severe lost circulation often plagued the operations. Of even greater import was the fact that the rigs were not equipped with large-enough drill pipe, collars, swivels, hoses, etc to permit pumping enough mud in the larger-sized holes to maintain the mud velocities required for efficient removal of cuttings.",,American Petroleum Institute

Subsequently, the Institute sponsored research in forecasting certain hurricane phenomena. In 1962, the committee reported results representing substantla1 scientific success and promising more effective and economical offshore operational procedures. Five years of research had developed forcasting means applicable to weather situations possibly developing Into hurricanes by which those situation definitely to develop into hurricanes identified themselves through positive criteria and those not to develop through the absence of such criteria. The use of the method by forecasters attempting to predict such hurricane development or non-development should allow substantial savings In unnecessary offshore shutdown tune This use, and consequent saving, however involves two problems: 1, ready availability of suitable computers to forecasters, and 2, means to convert data as gathered to machine-usable form for a forecaster's office with a hurricane impending and already shorthanded to handle all the emergencies of that critical situation.HURRICANE SIGNIFICANCEWith America, Columbus discovered hurricanes. Since his time, several hundred hurricanes have aimed themselves at the eastern and southern coasts of North America. All of them carried death and destruction for use when they could bring their forces to bear upon men and their homes and possessions (Fig. 1 ) .Chronicles of 16th through 19th century hurricanes recount such things as blowing down 300 houses In Barbados and killing 200 persons, wrecking 26 ships with loss of 400 lives, washing away walls 6 feet thick, sinking 40 ships carrying 4,000 soldiers at Martinique, and killing 9,000 people ashore.The Galveston storm in 1900 cost 6,000 dead and $20,000,000 property damage and the one In 1915, 275 dead and $50,000,000 damage In 1957, the Cameron, Louisiana, hurricane took 300 lives and did $5,000,000 property damage.Today there are millions of people living along coasts which hurricanes menace at one or more points every year. Every coastal inhabitant, every summer and fall, faces the possibility that he may need to run from a hurricane to save his life Many of these people own homes which may represent a lifetime?s savings, but they face the possibility each year of damage or destruction from the wind and rising water which would accompany a hurricane into their communities . The past years have seen tremendous growth of coastal industry and its costly plants, each year to face the same hurricane threats. Whether a man?s concern is his life, his home, or an industrial installation for which he has personal responsibility, knowing whether or not a reported hurricane threat will materialize is important to him Will it strike? Should he run? Should he board up his windows? Should he draw the fires from the boilers and shut clown the plant?The petroleum industry?s offshore installations are a peculiar case of this universal concern for hurricanes",,American Petroleum Institute

The study consists of an analysis of approximately 1,100 dog legs which occurred in wells drilling in both hard and soft formations is the United State. Form a graphical plot of god-leg severity vs. distance of dog leg above total depth, an empirical curve is developed which represents a maximum permissible limit of dog leg severity The empirically derived curve is in reasonably close agreement with theoretically determined limits of god-leg severity suggested by Lubinski1Based on the empirical curve a schedule of maximum permissible dog-leg severity was developed. This schedule was adopted by the committee as one to be recommended for use by the industry until further refinement becomes possible.An example is provided to illustrate how the schedule should be used in a straight-hole specification form similar to that in the API Model Drilling Contract.Also included is an explanation of why certain footnotes should be included with the specification form in order to gain fullest use of the schedule.INTRODUCTIONThe primary purpose of this study was to determine from an examination of field data what specific rate of change of angles could be tolerated in rotary bore holes. It was also desired to compare field data with rate-of-change schedules based on theoretical work done by Lubinski. Further, it was hoped that information might be obtained to determine whether type of formation (hard or soft) influences the maximum dog legs that could be tolerated.The study began in April 1962, when a letter was sent to members of the API Mid-Continent District Study Committee on Straight-hole Drilling asking for information on known dog legs and their effect on drilling problems. Directional surveys were requested, along with short statements as to dog-leg difficulties experienced. Replies were received from 10 companies, of which 6 provided the type of information requested. Usable data were received on 72 wells located in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and West Coast areas. In these wells directional surveys revealed a total of 1,094 dog legs. Of these, 51 caused trouble of various kinds.The types of troubles considered in the study were those encountered during drilling operations, such as keyseats, excessive drag or torque, and casing wear. Fatigue failures of drill pipe and drill-collar connections were also considered, with some limitations. Production problems were not included. since it was believed they could be better evaluated In separate studies if they were considered sufficiently important to warrant further investigation.SOFT FORMATIONSField DataTo examine the data systematically and to permit correlation with Lubinski's work, the reported dog legs were plotted on a graph of dog-leg severity vs. distance from bottom.

Van Wingen(Consulting Petroleum Engineer),,,,,,API-63-112,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"In view of the indicated lack of economic success in finding and developing new oil reserves, there is a great incentive to increase the oil-recovery efficiency for the already existing proved and developed oil accumulations by means of fluid injection Unitization is a requisite for such a method of operation. Therefore, it is pertinent that all possible steps be taken to facilitate unit plan negotiations.As a reflection of the continued population growth and expanding industrial activity in the Pacific Coast area, there has been a consistently increasing demand for petroleum products However, exploratory efforts to develop the required additional oil reserves have not been successful. This point is well illustrated by the following data which were complied for California by the American Petroleum Institute.(Table available in ful paper)During this 3-year period, California produced at a rate of approximate 297 million barrels per year. It is evident, therefore, that the new field or pool discoveries fell far short of replacing the production. This poor discovery record is not attributable to lack of effort, as indicated by the following data compiled by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.(Table available in ful paper)The percent of the total number of wildcat wells drilled which were successful is slightly more favorable when wells drilled primarily to find gas are also included. For this grouping, the respective annual figures are 7.1, 8 1, and 6.6 percent. .It is to be noted further that many discoveries result in uneconomic reserves Thus, only 11 profitable new field discoveries are listed by the AAPG for California during a 7-year period through 1956, or a discovery ratio of 1 for 183 wildcat wells. Of these 11 fields, 8 are indicated to have reserves of from 10 to 25 million barrels and only 1 in excess of 50 million barrels. .New discoveries which have been made are generally costly to produce because of either relatively great depth and/or locations which require directional drilling. Also, reserves which have been discovered on new lands are subject generally to higher royalty requirements than those which pertain to older producing areas. It is the consensus that much added oil may be discovered as a result of offshore development. However, from the operator's standpoint, the economic value of such oil is questionable In view of attendant extremely high development and operating costs and what appear to be excessive bonus and net profit arrangements demanded by the lessors. .In view of the indicated lack of economic success In finding and developing new oil reserves, there has been a growing awareness of the need to Increase the oil-recovery efficiency for the already-existing proved and developed oil accumulations.

Operation at higher well temperatures is possible for short periods. Means have not been incorporated In the present system for viewing through opaque well fluids. The system has been field-tested, and photographs of the television monitor screen have been used to record down-hole details observed during the tests.INTRODUCTIONDrilling and production personnel have often felt that problems at hand can be better solved by the ability to see down-hole. Shell Development Company has developed a down-hole television system which gives the petroleum industry this down-hole visual capability. Designed as a general-purpose down-hole viewing Instrument, the system is also of value to geologists since it enables them to observe subsurface lithologic features In place. Development has been accelerated by use of the prototype Instrument In actual field studies As the result of the Intensive field testing, the system has quickly evolved into a reliable and fieldworthy instrument.DOWN-HOLE TELEVISION SYSTEMThe down-hole television system is designed along the lines of conventional oil-field logging equipment for making detailed observations of underground features heretofore viewable only by limited photographic means U.

After establishment of a secondary gas cap by pressure depletion and gas injection, a slug of LPG composed of propane andnbutane was injected into the reservoir. This was followed by a mixture of LPG and dry gas, after which dry gas alone was injected. Within a year from the start of the project, positive results were observed when the pool gas-oil ratio dropped and the oil-production rate increased. The current performance of the pool indicates that from a practical standpoint the miscible recovery phase is approaching completion. Therefore, it is now possible to make an evaluation of the performance and economics of this miscible-phase type displacement process.INTRODUCTIONThe Rio Bravo Field was discovered in 1937 by the Union Oil Co. of California and is listed among those fields with a productive potentla1 of 100,000,000 bbl of oil or greater. Development progressed rapidly and to date approximately 140 wells have been drilled in the immediate area. The field was unitized in 1946 with The Superior Oil Company as Operator. Included within the Unit were the Rio Bravo, Vedder, and Osborn producing zones. In recent years, development of the deeper Helbling sand, the shallower Olcese sand, and numerous shallow gas sands has taken place. The zone in which the miscible flood was carried out was the Osborn. It is actually considered to be a part of the Vedder series, but is separated from the main Vedder by a 50-ft section of shale or siltstone. This sand, or its equivalent, is not known to exist in any other oil field. Fig. 1 is an example of a typical electric log through the Unit zones taken from a well in the area of Osborn zone production. Because the Osborn was of comparatively minor nature and was confined to the crestal area of the field, initial development was centered in the Rio Bravo and Vedder zones. It was not until 1955 that a concerted program of well deepening and repair work was undertaken to provide completions exclusively in the Osborn.",,American Petroleum Institute

Howard(Pan America Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-63-138,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"A procedure is presented for determining the embedment pressure of a rock. This factor gives a direct indication of the resistance of a rock to embedment by a propping material and the effect of the rock on propping-agent deformation. This embedment pressure was correlated with experimentally obtained fracture capacity so that propping agents may be selected to obtain a desired fracture capacity. A correlation was also made between long- and short-term fracture capacity tests to reduce the time required for the determination of the best prop for a specific formation and depth. Selection charts are presented to guide in the selection of the best propping-agent type and concentration based on formation characteristics and well depth.INTRODUCTIONExperimental work in the determination of fracture capacities has revealed a marked difference in the way in which different proppants (fracture-propping agents) respond to various cores. Some proppants shatter completely when subjected to overburden loads while other materials deform into small pancakes . In other situations the propping material embeds in the core face without shattering or deforming. The effect of different formations on the propped-fracture conductivity or fracture-flow capacity, more briefly called fracture capacity, was studied by means of a formation core-evaluating technique. The results were correlated with fracture capacity in such a way that the correlation can be used to select propping materials to obtain maximum fracture capacity. A companion study to determine the decline of fracture capacity with time was also made.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREEmbedment PressureEmbedment pressure is a measure of the maximum pressure required to embed a steel ball to a given depth in a rock. This gives a direct indication of the resistance of the formation to embedment by a propping material and the effect of the rock on proppant deformation.The test specimens used in this evaluation technique are cores taken from the formation in the zone of interest. The apparatus for determining the embedment pressure of a rock uses a steel ball of 0.05-in. diameter which is mounted on the upper (moving) platen of a hydraulic compression testing machine. The rock specimen is placed on the lower platen of the tester. The ball point is embedded to a depth of 0.00625 in. and the load required is recorded. The indentation is examined under a microscope and its diameter in the plane of the rock surface is measured. Experimental results have shown that, in general, the diameter of the indentation increases as the embedment pressure decreases. It is believed that this difference in diameter is due to the mechanical properties of the rock. This diameter is used to calculate a projected area which is then divided into the load to obtain the embedment pressure.A tabulation of representative embedment pressures of various producing formations is included in Table 1. An examination of these data shows that the embedment pressure can vary widely from one formation to another and even from one depth to another within the same formation.",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper describes this installation and reports on the information and data gained from the operation of the gas turbines. Although these engines cannot be considered to be fully proved in this application because of the limited service to date, it is concluded that the experience gained from this operation indicates that economical and satisfactory automatic operation can be expected from the gas-turbine engines in this installation.INTRODUCTIONIn April 1961, Gulf Oil Corporation put into operation a high-pressure water-pump station on the C. A. Goldsmith Lease in Ector County, Texas. This station pumps water for the pressure-maintenance operation being conducted in the Goldsmith (5,600 ft. ) Field. Gas-turbine engines are being used as the prime movers at this station, and it is the(1 purpose of this paper to report on the installation and 20-months operation of these gas turbines.DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTALLATIONThe engines installed at the Goldsmith injection station are Saturn T-1000 Series gas-turbines manufactured by Solar, a subsidiary of International Harvester Company. They are variable-speed, two-shaft engines with 8-stage rotary axial-flow compressors and are equipped for natural-gas fuel. The combustion chamber is a cylindrical annulus and is designed for axial-flow operation. Speed-reduction gears arc mounted inside the output shaft housing of the gas-turbine. These engines are rated at 1.000 brake-horsepower at the plant-site elevation of 3,140 ft. and at an ambient temperature of 75 F with an inlet air-pressure drop of 1 in. of water and no exhaust losses. The speed-reduction gear has the necessary gear ratio to reduce the maximum turbine shaft output speed from 22,300 rpm to 3,870 rpm. The total weight of each engine and attached accessories is approximately 1,500 Ib.The turbines are driving stage, horizontal, split-case, double-volute, centrifugal pumps which are rated at 33,500 BWPD at 1,200 psi pressure at rated speed of 3,870 rpm. The pump cases are rated at 2,000 psi working pressure.Outdoor InstallationFig. 1 is a general view of the water-injection station showing the arrangement of the gas turbines, pumps, etc. This is essentially an outdoor installation. (Fig. 1 is available in full paper) The small building shown houses controls only. A small cubicle is built around each gas turbine to provide some protection from the elements and to reduce the noise level. This cubicle can be seen in Fig. 2 just to the left of the centrifugal pumps. An air-to-oil radiator assembly is mounted on the side of the engine closure to provide cooling for the lube oil. Also shown in Fig. 2 is a combination assembly containing an oil-bath air filter and an evaporative air cooler which is provided for each engine to filter and cool the air for consumption in the turbine. The turbines and centrifugal pumps have been unitized and mounted on oil-field type skids with the turbine and engine enclosure mounted on a separate sub-base for portability and ease of repair, as shown in Fig.3.",,American Petroleum Institute
663,321196,,Understanding and Combating Gas Interference in pumping wells,J.D. Clegg(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-63-149,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"Gas interference continues to be one of the major operating problems in pumping wells. In order to combat this problem effectively, a better understanding is needed of what the pump volumetric efficiency should be under various well subsurface conditions. Once it is known how the pump should perform, it will be possible to select the best setting depth and determine whether a gas anchor is needed. Care must be used in the selection and installation of gas anchors, otherwise the results will be disappointing. If free gas is present, not only must an effective gas anchor be used but the pump must develop a high compression ratio. Thus, the type and design pump used is critical. Pumping wells from under a packer and small-diameter casing completions are two practices that have increased the gas-interference problem. Pump efficiencies and production can often be improved in such wells.UNDERSTANDING PUMP VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCYIn order to better understand gas interference, the pumping conditions as they occur in an oil well need to be analyzed. In Fig. 1 the pump volumetric efficiency is plotted vs. the pump intake pressure. Pump intake pressure is defined as the pressure In the casing opposite the pump under producing conditions. Fig. 1 is for a typical reservoir and for conditions where there is, no slippage of fluid past the plunger; and, near-zero clearance between the standing and traveling valves at the bottom of the stroke.Such a graph can be drawn for any field or reservoir using the appropriate PVT conditions. Under bottom-hole conditions, a barrel of stock-tank oil will occupy a greater volume because of the gas in solution; thus, a larger volume must be pumped to obtain 1 bbl of stock-tank oil. If all the gas can be vented, the pump efficiency will increase as the pressure is reduced. This is shown by lineBC,/i&gt; In Fig. 1. At pressures greater than the bubble point (lineAB) the pump efficiency remains almost constant. The lower curve (lineBF) shows that the efficiency rapidly decreases for pressures less than the bubble point if all the free gas is pumped. If part of the gas can be vented, then the pump efficiencies will be higher.Usually very little gas is vented from the casing at pressures approaching the bubble point. This probably results since at the high pressures the gas bubbles are small, thus gravity has very little influence in separation. The small-size gas bubbles are easily entrained and are carried in the same direction as the oil. As the pressure is decreased, the gas bubbles grow in size and more separation occurs. As reported by Peebles and Garber,1relatively large gas bubbles will rise at about 0.5-0.6 ft/sec. In general, the rising velocity depends upon the bubble size and shape and the physical characteristics of the liquid. When the pressure is decreased, bubble size increases and gas separation begins to improve.",,American Petroleum Institute

Gray(Shell Oil Development Company),,,,,,API-63-156,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"The quality of the polished-rod motion produced by a surface pumping unit is one of the factors affecting overall performance of sucker-rod pumping systems. Non-dimensional equations describing this motion can be used for direct comparison of the displacement, velocity (torque factor), and acceleration characteristics produced by variations of beam unit geometry. Calculations have been implemented with a FORTRAN language computer program and typical results have been developed for the four main types of commercially available pumping units. In addition, four variant pumping-unit designs have been analyzed to show the effect of more or less extreme departures from conventional practice. The influence of unit geometry on rod loads, crankshaft torques, and pump displacements is illustrated by a sequence of calculated dynagraph cards.INTRODUCTIONThe fact that different types and models of oil-well pumping units result in polished-rod motions which are varied in character is well-known. However, there is little general information available on the specific nature of these variations, what brings then1 about, and what the end effects are on overall performance of the sucker-rod pumping system. Better understanding of these points must be had if the manufacturers are to give due attention to kinematic factors in the design of their equipment, and if the users are to make better evaluations of the relative advantages of one type of unit over another for given operating conditions.The purpose of this paper is to set forth simplified means for comparing the motions produced by pumping units, to evaluate the characteristics of equipment now in common use, to point out how certain more or less desirable features can be studied, and to present an example of the theoretical effect of kinematic factors on the performance of a pumping system.POLISHED-ROD POSITIONThe oil-field beam pumping unit is built around what is known technically as a four-bar mechanical linkage. This implies that four properly chosen linear dimensions are sufficient to determine, say, the angular position of the beam in terms of crank angle. However, we are interested here in polished-rod motion and one additional linear dimension is needed to establish the relation between beam angle and polished-rod position. The geometrical relationship of these five lengths and the nomenclature used in the following discussion are illustrated in Fig. 1.The two pumping-unit configurations in common use are shown separately in Fig. 1. Pull-up units [Fig. l (a)] are designated herein as Class 1 geometry and push-up units [Fig. 1 (b)] as Class 2. Actually the only kinematic difference between the two classes lies in the sense (direction) of the polished-rod motion which is produced. If constructed so as to obtain equal values of the five basic dimensions, the two classes result in motions oppositely directed, but alike in all other respects. As a further point in consideration of Fig. 1, it should be remarked that such factors as placement of the tail bearing above or below the beam, the type of pitman assembly, and whether or not the beam is horizontal at mid-stroke have no influence whatsoever on the kinematic output of the unit. Complete specification of the output motion is obtained with knowledge of the unit class, the direction of crank rotation, and the dimensions L1 through L5.",,American Petroleum Institute

Chesney(Humble Oil Refining Company Corpus Christi Texas),,,,,,API-63-166,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"Injection costs and system downtime have increased alarmingly over the past 5 years as injection pressures have increased above 2,500 psig. The increased costs and downtime have been occasioned by a high incidence of pump-plunger, packing, valve, and fluid-end failures despite improved injection systems. Plunger .failures have increased with pressure because of breakage, abrasion, and/or corrosion. These failures contribute to unacceptable average packing life of 18 days and indicate need for rapid advancement by pump manufacturers toward a long-life plunger and packing combination. Valve failures are believed to be caused by plastic distortion of valve recess shoulders that results in localized stress and early failure. The cause of fluid end failures, as indicated by investigation and literature research, has been corrosion fatigue, intensified by casting, forging, or manufacturing defects, rough internal surfaces, and stress concentration resulting from insufficient radii at corners and intersections. These factors need to be given greater consideration to insure better pump expendable parts and fluid-end performance.INTRODUCTIONPressures required to inject water into oil-producing formations have increased significantly over the past 5 years as pressure maintenance by water injection into deeper reservoirs has been initiated. Prior to 1958 injection pressures were generally less than 2,500 psi. since 1958 a large number of 100- to 150-hp triplex injection pumps have been installed in the Southwest Texas area to operate at pressures from 2,500 to 5,000 psi. Operations have been characterized by high pump repair costs and inefficient pressure-maintenance operations because of pump downtime. Costs of plungers, packing, and valves and for power-end repairs - as shown in Fig. 1-have been 7.8 times as high for pumps operating at 5,000 psi as for those operating at 2,500 psi. Of even greater significance are the costs of fluid-end replacement, as shown in Fig. 2. Pumps operating at a pressure of 5,000 psi have had replacement costs 31.7 times as high as those operating at 2,500 psi. Injection-system downtime, as shown in Fig. 3, has been 22 percent and 60 percent, respectively, at operating pressures of 2,500 and 5,000 psi. This downtime and the high costs previously mentioned represent a significant monetary loss and should be a matter of deep concern to both pump manufacturers and users.SYSTEM DESIGNEarly experience gained in handling salt water at extreme pressures indicated premature pump failure (Fig. 1 is available in full paper) was attributable to poor injection-system design. Such a system is illustrated by Fig. 4 which shows numerous bends and irregularities in the suction and discharge piping at the pump. Further impairment of suction conditions at this installation is shown in Fig. 5 where suction piping at the water-source tank, approximately 100 ft from the pump, was installed with numerous (Fig. 2 and 3 are available in full paper) bends, changes in elevation, and restrictions due to valves and n small fluid meter.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hoss(Consulting Petroleum Engineer),,,,,,API-63-173,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1963,"The 74 water-flood projects in the Denver-Julesburg Basin were reviewed as of December 1, 1062, and 38 were studied to determine their ultimate primary and water-flood oil recoveries and the factors affecting that performance. The remaining 36 projects were eliminated as being unsuitable for analysis because of partial water drive, insufficient history, economic failure, or limited injection pattern. It is concluded that primary recovery per acre-foot affects water-flood recovery per acre-foot. Primary recovery, and hence water-flood recovery, has been found to be affected inversely by net pay thickness, directly by permeability, and not at all by well spacing in terms of acres and acre-feet per well. Water-flood recovery has been found to be affected inversely by the percent primary depletion at initial injection and not at all by water-injection rates per acre-foot or per foot. For 33 line-drive projects, the ratio of cumulative net barrels of water injected to the total barrels of oil produced since injection began is a useful criterion of the percent depletion of the total oil reserves remaining after initial injection. After 40-percent depletion of these reserves, this .net injection ratio declines with further depletion to an average minimum value at termination of from 1.2 for J sand projects and 2.4 for D sand projects.INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this study is to review the performance of the 74 water-flood projects in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado and Nebraska as of December 1, 1962, and to determine from experience what factors are related to water-flood oil recovery.Water flooding in the Denver-Julesburg Basin began in Colorado September 18, 1956, with the successful but small Willard project, now abandoned. This project was soon followed by other projects according to the history shown in Fig. 1. Of the total 74 projects, 71 are still active in various stages of depletion. Sufficient history is now available on 38 projects to estimate their ultimate recoveries and permit some conclusions as to factors affecting performance. Admittedly, the final conclusions must await termination of many projects. However, if experience is to be put to practical use, the performance must be analyzed as early as possible. It is hoped that the conclusions developed herein will be of value in conducting the present projects to conclusion, and in the planning of new projects in the Denver-Julesburg Basin.SCOPE OF DATAThe 74 projects were studied and classified to select those yielding useful information. As shown in Table 1, 36 projects were eliminated from the data as either being under significant partial water drive, having insufficient water-injection history, being an economic failure, or having a very limited injection pattern as would usually be the case with one or two injection wells. Only 7 projects, or 9.5 percent of the 74 water floods, are classified as failures. These failures are believed to be the result of excessively high gas saturation at initial injection, adverse wettability, bottom water, fractures associated with very low matrix permeability, and associated gas caps.",,American Petroleum Institute

Shore(Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation),,,,,,API-64-007,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"Studies in both laboratory and field have brought the problems of casing damage from perforating into sharper focus. These studies have shown that steel-carrier, shaped-charge guns do not cause casing deformation. The forces that might. act to distort the casing are absorbed by the carrier.Expendable-type perforators, however, produce high pressures that can seriously deform or even split the casing. The extent of the resulting damage is a function of explosive load, proximity of explosive to casing, casing support, and casing properties. Test results suggest that expendable guns may be operated under a wide range of field conditions without serious casing deformation provided the explosive load is held within reasonable limits.The effects on casing resulting from bullet perforating are also discussed.INTRODUCTIONWithin the broad family of explosive perforating tools available today are practical and versatile devices capable of efficient performance under a multitude of field conditions. Since their introduction to field use, however, much thought has been given to the degree of casing deformation to be expected from the sudden release of explosive forces during perforating.Isolated instances are reported of casing splitting. Other reports show that, at times, the inside diameter of casing is reduced. Field experience indicates that certain types of guns produce a much higher incidence of casing damage than others. Then, also, perforators which produce damage in one case offer trouble-free service in many others. Thus it is evident that the nature and degree of casing deformation depends both upon the particular gun used and on specific conditions in the well.It is the purpose of this paper to present the results of laboratory studies made to investigate some of the major factors influencing casing deformation or damage. Although some conclusions on bullet-gun perforating are included, emphasis is placed primarily on shaped-charge perforators, since these are now predominantly used in all areas.FACTORS INFLUENCING CASING DEFORMATIONThe detonation of explosive shaped charges results in rapid emission of gas, building up rapidly to ultra-high pressures and to the generation of intense shock waves.1,2Only part of the energy liberated in the explosion is expended in converting the shaped-charge liner into a high-speed penetrating jet; the remainder generates large shock forces on the inside walls of gun carriers or casing.Although the peak pressures associated with detonation approach 4 X 106psi,2they are extremely transient in nature. The actual time required for a single charge to completely detonate is less than 100 microseconds3. It is further significant that the pressures build up and decay very rapidly over this time interval. Thus, while there is a tendency toward deformation of a gun carrier or casing, their inertia offers substantial protection against the very short-term forces.Fig. I-Basic Types of Gun Perforators (Available in full paper)Hollow-carrier steel, retrievable shaped chargeExpendable-capsule shaped chargeBullet perforatorGun ConsiderationsIllustrated in Fig. 1 are the hollow-carrier steel shaped-charge, the expendable-shaped-charge, and the bullet-gun perforators, which are the basic types of perforators offered to the industry today.",,American Petroleum Institute

Buster(Byron Jackson Inc.),,,,,,API-64-015,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"Multiple tubingless completions have attracted interest everywhere, and have become a routine completion practice in many areas. Successful primary cementing has been difficult to attain, but good methods and techniques have been developed through experience and common sense.This paper presents a review of current cementing practices and outlines a composite triple tubingless cementing operation. Some points that are important to the success of primary cementing are described and applied to multiple tubingless work.INTRODUCTIONEven with present knowledge of deep drilling, it is unusual to think of running and cementing 30,000 ft of casing in one stage-although multiple tubingless completions handle this much casing in routine fashion. Quadruple tubingless completions to 8,000ft are now common. Multiple tubingless completions are doing a good job, are attracting a lot of interest, and will no doubt eventually be used in many areas in addition to the present hot spots in South and West Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.The purpose of this paper is to present information that will be of use to those who are interested in multiple tubingless completions, and to provide some detail on the techniques and methods used in cementing. The purpose is to explain, not to justify whether tubingless completions should be used. Because of the variety of special tools and equipment, and the many excellent manufacturers' catalogs available, this paper will discuss special tools only to the extent needed for complete understanding of the cementing processes to be covered.The techniques of cementing multiple tubingless completions vary widely between areas and between individuals concerned. Cementing tubingless completions , whether single or multiple, has always been critical because of the small size of pipe involved. Cement left above the top plug caused much trouble and additional expense during the early days of tubingless cementing -and almost convinced the industry that tubingless completions were completely impractical. The problem of cement on top of the plug has been overcome, as have most of the other problems encountered. Current tubingless cementing techniques reflect the experience of many people working in many areas.As with so many oil-field techniques, there is no single correct method that works everywhere; there are several good methods that all do a good job. A discussion of some of the factors involved will help to develop a composite job technique that should be satisfactory under a wide range of operating conditions.SIZE OF PIPE AND HOLEThe size of the strings used in multiple tubingless work is determined by the specific lifting problems that are encountered in each zone to be produced. Mixed strings, where one string of 4 &frac12;-in. OD might be run with two strings of 2 ?-in., are popular when one producing zone will require gas-lifting.Although one can never be certain of the number of strings of pipe that will actually be run, the maximum number of planned strings will be known and will determine the size of surface pipe that should be used.

Winn(Halliburton Company)|Terry Walker(Welex),,,,,,API-64-024,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"The limitations of the single-curve cement bond log have led to development of variable-density film recording of the acoustic signal as an aid for cement-bond evaluation by the well operator. This type of recording makes use of all arrivals on the acoustic signal to minimize some of these interpretation limitations.This type recording has long been used by the seismic industry and called a variable-density seismogram. Since the spacings used in down-hole surveys are small compared to those used in seismic exploration, the variable-density recording is called a Micro-Seismogram Log Acoustic coupling at the pipe-cement interface and the cement-formation interface are indicated by this log. Where good cement bond exists, information regarding formation character may also be observed.Examples of logs showing cement channeling and logs made after remedial squeezing are shown.INTRODUCTIONLocation of channels in the cement sheath by acoustic means has focused attention of the industry on primary cementing techniques. Due to the great variety of logging techniques used, interpretation of cement bonding has been largely dependent upon availability of pertinent well data and understanding of the logging technique used. Most acoustic bond evaluation instruments employ only a portion of the total acoustic signal which is received after traveling a number of paths from a transmitting source. Single-curve amplitude measurements made on only a selected portion of this received acoustic signal, therefore, give only a small portion of the available information. In addition, these measurements may be influenced by factors which are not related to bonding. Some of these factors are: Formation paths that are faster than casing-path travel, and lateral movements of the sonde in the casing.A variable-density film-recording technique for displaying the acoustic wave train signal has been introduced as a method of bond evaluation. This method employs the received acoustic signal in its entirety, and therefore is not subject to many of the interpretation limitations of the single-curve bond log. Interpretation of this record provides qualitative information regarding the condition of the cement sheath surrounding the pipe.TRAVEL OF ACOUSTIC ENERGY IN CASED HOLESAcoustic energy generated by the transmitter travels through the well-bore fluid to the casing as compressional waves. After reaching the fluid-solid boundary, the acoustic energy is distributed as described by G. R. Pickett.' The amplitude of the first-wave arrivals , which have traveled through the well-bore fluid from the transmitter to the pipe and along the pipe to a point adjacent to the receiving transducer at plate velocity, is measured and related to bonding of the cement sheath to the pipe for production of the single-curve bond log. The distance which separates the transmitter from the receiver is usually of the order of 4 ft. However, this distance may be varied for specific situations.In uncemented pipe, the first-arriving pipe-borne portion of the acoustic signal is of high amplitude as shown in Fig. l (A). The amplitude is dependent upon the degree to which the pipe is free to vibrate.Fig. I - Acoustic-energy Travel in Cased Wells (Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Initial investigations proved pipe bond a function of pipe sui-face finish.Both field and laboratory data indicated an improvement in cement-pipe bond could be obtained using resin-sand coated pipe. Methods used in cement-pipe bond testing were mechanical, hydraulic, and acoustical. These bonds were determined on laboratory specimens, in experimental test wells, and actual field wells.Perforation studies were made using a resin-sand coating applied to small-diameter casing. Perforating tests were conducted on laboratory samples utilizing expendable jet charges to -evaluate the durability of resin-sand coating.INTRODUCTIONMany advances have occurred since the initial use of cement in the oil-producing industry to help isolate zones and to provide protection for the casing string. Basically, these improvements can be divided into two major groups, mechanical or chemical. Mechanical improvements have been made on blending and mixing equipment, tools, casing equipment, and many other accessories. Chemical advancements include many special additives for blending with cement to control fluid loss, slurry weight, setting and thickening time, lost circulation, and other slurry properties indicated to be important for improved cementing jobs.One of the latest improvements in materials is the use of friction-reducing additives in cement. These chemicals reduce apparent slurry viscosity and allow turbulent displacement at lower pumping rates and pressures than with conventional slurries. This practice1,2,3makes possible better removal of circulatable mud from the annulus during cementing to yield a more uniform sheath of cement between the casing and well bore. More recent mechanical advancements include the introduction of acoustic logging techniques for evaluation of cementing results in terms of bonding at the pipe and cement formation interfaces. Many questions have arisen concerning these logs, .since a multitude of factors influence their correct interpretations4-10 inclAlso, considerable interest was generated in cement bonding capabilities and methods which might be applicable to improvement of this property since it affects the quality of a primary cementing job.Previous work11,12has shown a laboratory method of determining shear, gas, and hydraulic bonds. Shear bond is the mechanical bond that supports pipe in the hole and is expressed in pounds per square inch of pipe surface contacted by cement. Gas and hydraulic bond is the resistance to gas or fluid migration a t the casing-cement interface and is expressed as the pressure, in pounds per square inch gage, necessary to initiate failure.One of the most recent methods introduced to the oil and gas industry to improve the cement-pipe bond has been the application of a resin-sand coat to the casing. This process consists of a resin film applied to the casing into which sand is then partially embedded. Resin-sand coating of casing may be classified as both a mechanical and chemical advancement. Mechanically, a resin-sand coat applied to the OD of the casing provides a larger area, as well as a rougher surface to which the cement can adhere. Chemically, the resin material must possess certain properties",,American Petroleum Institute

If parameters of these formations are known, the operation can be designed for lowest cost by varying rig equipment and drilling practices. The wells can be drilled on paper several times and the best available drilling equipment and practices can be preselected.This paper discusses the formation parameters necessary for design and a routine, simple technique for obtaining them. These parameters can be used to select the best operating levels of weight and rotary speed for a given rig. The economics of using various available rigs to drill a subject well can be evaluated by balancing the operating costs of the rigs against the projected drilling performance. Non-drilling time performance of the various rigs can be evaluated by past performance. An example of engineering design is given.The science of programmed drilling operations is still in its infancy. A section of this paper discusses current points of weakness which require further study. A concept of how this technology will be used in the future is given.INTRODUCTIONEngineering design in any endeavor concerns the application of theoretical or empirical knowledge about the behavior of materials, machines, or structures in various working environments.When an engineer designs a machine, a bridge, or anything else, he first determines the nature of the job to be accomplished-what the loads will be, the pressures, the temperatures. When this is known, he applies his knowledge of the performance of various materials and techniques and comes up with a design that will accomplish the purpose. He then refines his plan in the light of economics. He makes alterations until the final design represents the best balance between required performance and economics. When a plan is devised that will most economically fill the need, design is complete.Design implies that a plan has been made and, therefore, suggests some degree of control over the outcome of a sequence of events can be exercised. Drilling operations are not usually designed in this manner. Drillers, to a degree, are controlled by formations they drill rather than exercising control. We put bits in the hole, turn to the right, and take what we get.The engineer is able to predict the performance of materials, such as steel, because the properties of these materials have been studied in detail and recorded. Every time a drill bit penetrates a formation, information about the performance of the bit and the nature of the formation is generated. If this information is recorded and properly evaluated, it can be used to make predictions about the outcome of future drilling operations. The merit of attaining improved performance during certain phases of a drilling operation can be evaluated by a complete analysis of the effects on the overall economics of the operation.The technique of operations research consists generally of predicting the outcome of all available courses of action and then selecting the best one, according to some pre-selected criteria.",,American Petroleum Institute

Reducing liquid holdup with sphere operation decreases pressure drop or increases pipeline capacity. A mathematical model for such a gathering system is constructed on the basis of the physical model. It is anticipated that the mathematical model can be used as a design tool for multiphase gathering lines of this type.Use of spheres in these pipelines by several operators has already demonstrated in field application the capacity and economic advantages of this system. It is hoped that this mathematical model will make these advantages more widely available by allowing the prediction of pipeline performance before lines are laid.INTRODUCTIONAbout 60 percent of the gas sold in the United States is gathered through two-phase pipelines. There are over 50,000 miles of multiphase gathering lines. Gas-condensate and oil fields located offshore often use multiphase lines to more their production to the land. Total investment in multiphase gathering systems in the United States is probably about one billion dollars.In 1958 the oil and gas industries began a joint effort to improve design and performance of these pipelines. The AGA-API Multiphase Research Committee was formed. It has a continuing program of pipeline testing and data correlation. Many companies have tested their lines and sent the results to the Multiphase Committee. A data-correlation program for operating pipelines and laboratory experiments is being conducted by the University of Houston.Several operators passed pigs through their multiphase pipelines to remove the liquid accumulation. A few did this on a regular schedule. Spheres were first used in multiphase pipelines in 1958.1In July 1959 Dave W. Bean and H. Norman Eagleton, of Colorado Interstate Gas Company, experimented with an 8-in. multiphase pipeline. They passed rubber spheres through the line to control the amount of liquid holdup. Pipeline capacity was increased substantially. In November 1959 Colorado Interstate built its first gathering system using this principle. Rubber spheres were passed through the line automatically from a magazine a t regular intervals. The first paper describing this system was published byPipe Line Industryin March 1960.2W. 0. Medlin presented a paper at the NGPA meeting in Tyler, Texas in October 1961 describing The Carthage Company?s experience.3.

Anderson(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-64-069,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"The technology of fresh-water mud systems has advanced rapidly in the last 10 years, but salt-water systems are basically the same as they were 25 years ago. The consistent success of low-solids fresh-water muds in reducing drilling costs suggested application of the low-solids principle to salt-water muds. Laboratory drilling tests show that clay solids dispersed in salt water do not have as pronounced an effect on drilling rate as they do in fresh water, but still cause a significant drilling-rate reduction. The data indicate that the clay-solids content of salt muds should be maintained at approximately 3 percent by volume to achieve a high drilling rate while still having viscosity, gel, and fluid-loss properties for cutting transport and hole stability. To obtain this objective, a low-solids salt mud was developed which utilizes prehydrated bentonite-polymer slurry for viscosity control and an experimental gum as a fluid-loss reducer. The experimental gum was found to have a higher tolerance for additional solids, such as bit cuttings, than starch or guar gum. Also, this gum reduces pressure losses in the drill string and annulus which makes possible the design of improved rig hydraulics programs. A well In western Oklahoma was drilled with the low-solids salt mud 6 clays faster and with 8 less bits than an offset well drilled with a conventional salt mud.INTRODUCTIONA review of technical and patent literature on drilling fluids from 1938 to the present shows a multitude of articles and patents on fresh-water drilling fluids and additives, but surprisingly few on salt-water type fluids. This shows a lack of research on the part of the oil industry in salt-water drilling fluids which is somewhat inconsistent with the rather extensive use of these type fluids in the Mid-Continent, West Texas, and Rocky Mountain areas of the United States. The lack of progress in salt-water fluids is probably best-illustrated by the fact that wells are being drilled at the present time with the high-viscosity-high-gel attapulgite-starch salt muds that were first used in the late 1930's.In contrast, there have been many significant improvements in fresh-water muds, many of these in the last 10 years. The developments which have probably had the most impact are the chrome lignosulfate systems1for drilling deep, hot wells and low-solids systems2for decreasing drilling costs. Low-solids freshwater muds have been so consistently successful that it is now generally recognized that the amount of dispersed clay solids present in a mud is the most important factor affecting penetration rate. An analysis of the amount of clay which includes bentonite, sub-bentonite, and attapulgite used in preparing and maintaining drilling fluids in the last 4 years shows the extent of the trend toward low-solids muds. In 1959, 2.62 tons of clay mere used for every 1,000 ft of hole drilled in the United States. In 1963, 2.27 tons of clay were used for every 1,000 ft of hole drilled.3This amounts to a significant reduction of 100,000 tons of clay usage over this period and, although actual figures are not yet available.",,American Petroleum Institute

Curtis(Standard Oil Co. of Colifornia),,,,,,API-64-078,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"The relatively new high-speed compressors have a good economic potential in many oil- and gas-field compressor applications. Compactness and high horsepower- to-weight ratio allowed by 1,000-rpm operation, good running balance inherent in the balance-opposed compressor design, and simplicity offered by the separation of the compressor and power ends result in an ideal compressor unit for low-cost field and plant installations.Operating costs and, in particular, long-term maintenance costs have not been fully evaluated because of insufficient operating history. However, the experience of most operators to date indicates that operating costs are higher in comparison with those of the slow-speed, heavy-duty units, which have been the standard of the industry. Comparison bases, however, are frequently inequitable.Regardless of any deficiencies of the high-speed units, their initial low investment, in most cases, will overcome any higher operating costs that can be reasonably anticipated.INTRODUCTIONSince 1956, 20 West Coast oil- and gas-field operators have purchased more than 80 high-speed compressors. The majority of the high-speed units are being used in field locations where relatively low horsepower is required for a relatively short. period of time. However, some operators are installing this type of unit in process- plant service where, traditionally, the heavy slow-speed units have been used.These installations have been made in the very recent years where the increasingly strong forces of competition and high costs require maximum economy in all phases of operation. Although there is little argument over the initial cost advantage of the high-speed units, many operators are uncertain about the overall economy of this type of unit, particularly since early experience indicates that maintenance costs will be higher.HIGH-SPEED COMPRESSOR EQUIPMENTThe term high-speed compressor as used herein pertains to reciprocating compressors rated for operation at 900 or 1,000 rpm, having one or more pairs of horizontally opposed compressor cylinders, and driven by separable prime movers such as internal-combustion engines or electric motors. Generally the compressor, driver, and the majority of required auxiliary equipment are mounted on a common structural-steel skid to form a complete, compact compressor plant.There are at least 6 manufacturers of high-speed compressors offering units in the 100- to 600-hp range. One manufacturer offers units up to 2,000-hp. Some manufacturers will package their own compressors into complete skid-mounted units, but the majority prefer to sell compressors for packaging by others.Compressor types to be used for comparison are the slow-speed units, rated at 300 to 350 rpm, and the medium-speed units rated at 400 to 600 rpm. Generally, the slow-speed units are angle-type, having an integral power end, and are mounted on permanent concrete foundations. Auxiliary equipment is generally mounted separately, and often is common to two or more compressors. The medium-speed units also are angle-type, but are skid-mounted in most cases.West Coast OperatorsAs shown in Table 1, at least 20 West Coast operators have purchased 80 or more units since 1956. All but 8 of the 80 units purchased are driven by engines. Although some operators have limited purchases to one or two types of manufacturers",,American Petroleum Institute

Faced with leveled-off volumes and prices, management typically turns to cost cutting as the surest short-term means of bolstering profits.

The average return on net worth for the domestic, integrated companies as a group has dropped -from 15 percent in 1951, to 12 percent in 1955, to the current level of about 8 percent. Plagued by external restrictions and competitive pressures, most managements, for some time now, have been looking inside the company -at the organization-as asource of addedprofits.The heavy focus on manpower costs is one result. Concurrent efforts to increase organizational effectiveness is another. Manpower utilization thus is a two-sided coin, with each playing a vital role in profit improvement.INDUSTRY-WIDE RESULTS TO DATETurning first to the manpower-cost side, a logical question is: What gains has the industry made? Beyond a doubt, the oil industry has achieved a large measure of success in securing a more effective utilization of its work force. This fact is pointed up by a recent analysis of the manpower trends in the 22 largest domestic, integrated oil companies that report annually the size of their work forces. Taking the 5-year period 1955 through 1962, the figures show that:Sixteen of the 82 companies now have a smaller work force. For these companies, the average decline has been 9 percent over the 5-year span of time.About one-quarter of the companies-9 to be exact-achieved reductions of over 10 percent (and even up to 22 percent) in the size of the total work force.Acquisitions, mergers, and major facility expansions no doubt account for much of the growth in number of employees for those six companies that had a gain. It is reasonable to assume that, had it not been for this, they too probably would have shown a shrinkage.Taking the 22 companies as a group, the overall reduction was 25,000 positions or approximately 4 percent of the total combined work force.One might be inclined to say that a 4-percent reduction is not much of an accomplishment for 5 years of concerted effort. However, there is more to the story. The statistics also show that throughputs and sales volumes increased substantially during the same period of time. Using dollar sales revenues as a simple index, volumes rose by 24 percent for all 22 companies combined. Thus, the productivity increase is far greater than that reflected by the 4-percent figure alone.A TOUGHER JOB AHEADThe fact that the oil industry is concerned about manpower costs, of course, is not news to you. Most, if not all, of your companies are engaged in some kind of cost-reduction effort. If your own experience is typical, you may have seen budgets slashed",,American Petroleum Institute

Howard(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-64-088,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"Fracture-capacity tests have demonstrated that, if propping materials such as nutshells, strong glass beads, aluminum, plastics, etc., are distributed in the fracture in a partial monolayer, rather than in a full monolayer, much greater fracture capacity will result. This is particularly true if a deformable prop-such as nutshells, aluminum, or plastic-is used since these materials, if emplaced as a full monolayer during fracturing, will be pressed into a tightly packed layer when the ful1,overburden load is applied. An improved method of spacing proppants in the fracture has been developed which uses pelletized material injected simultaneously with the proppants. After the spacer and props are in place, the well fluids dissolve the spacer material leaving a high-capacity fracture. Urea, a hydrocarbon resin, and sodium bisulfate are three materials found suitable for use as spacers.Results of field tests in 43 wells have shown that the use of a well-fluids-soluble spacer to achieve higher fracture capacity with nutshell proppant will result in higher post-fracturing productivity than will conventional treatments. On the basis of previous laboratory tests and these field tests, the use of proppant-spacing agents should be considered in all wells where nutshells, glass, or aluminum propping agents are used.INTRODUCTIONApproximately 400,000 fracturing treatments have been performed in the United States and Canada since 1949 with a success ratio of 80 to 90 percent. Hydraulic fracturing is undoubtedly the most universally used form of well stimulation employed in the United States, and has contributed significantly to the recoverable reserves available to the Nation. Although the success ratio of treatments is high and the production of oil is increased, there is still need for improvement of fracturing techniques. Such an improvement-the development and use of propping-agent spacers-is discussed in this paper.THEORYThe productivity of a well following fracturing is directly proportional to both the fracture to formation-flow capacity contrast (flow capacity of the fracture, md-ft, divided by the flow capacity of the formation, md-ft) and the fracture areal extent. The fracture to formation capacity contrast, in turn, is directly proportional to the fracture-flow capacity since the formation thickness and permeability are fixed.To illustrate the effect of fracture to formation-flow-capacity ratio on well production, refer to Fig. 1 which is a plot of fracture to formation capacity contrast vs. production increase from fracturing, with fracture penetration as a parameter. A fracture to formation capacity contrast of 10 and a fracture penetration of 40 percent will, for example, yield a 5-fold production increase. Increasing the fracture to formation capacity contrast to 100 effects an 8-fold increase in well production with the same fracture penetration. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that very little production increase is achieved by fracture to formation capacity contrasts higher than 100.1,2The fracture capacity is controlled by: 1, the fracture width; 2, the proppant distribution; and 3, the proppant concentration. The post-fracture width is controlled by the size of the prop that was placed during fracturing operations. The second factor, distribution of the propping agent.",,American Petroleum Institute

Angel(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-64-100,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"A two-phase flow correlation has been developed from field data to permit calculation of gas-lift pressure gradients for low-ratio gas-water flow in casing-tubing annuli and large-diameter tubing.Field data were correlated by the Poettmann-Carpenter1method for wells producing from 1,600 to 8,100 BLPD. Liquid production was more than 98 percent water. Gas-liquid ratios ranged from 50 to 300 cu ft/bbl. Although the correlation is applicable only to this limited gas-liquid ratio range, it applies to a large number of high-volume gas-lift wells that are being profitably produced with only small percentages of oil. Gas-lift gradient charts are presented for 7-in. X 2?-in. annuli, 4 &frac12;-in. OD tubing and 3 &frac12;-in. OD tubing at production rates ranging from 3,000 to 8,000 BFPD.INTRODUCTIONMany commercial oil wells produce only water with small percentages of oil by gas lift. Profitable production dictates the use of high production rates which require the use of large flow areas, usually the casing-tubing annulus or large-diameter tubing. Such wells are characterized by high productivity indexes and produce from reservoirs with strong water drivers which maintain reservoir pressures. Prediction of gas-water flowing gradients in these wells is necessary in order to evaluate the economics of gas lift, select optimum injection points, size gas-lift compressors, and calculate economic limits.Poettman and Carpenter' developed correlation methods for vertical multiphase flow and correlated field data for 2-in, 2 1/2-in., and 3-in. nominal tubing over a wide range of variables. Although their original correlation cannot be extended to apply to larger tubing over casing-tubing annuli, their methods can be applied to these flow systems by correlation of suitable field data.SOURCE OF DATALarge-diameter tubing flow data were obtained from measured pressure traverses in high-volume wells which were on test. In most cases, annular-flow data were obtained by testing high-volume wells and calculating subsurface injection pressures from surface injection pressures. Subsurface injection pressures could be calculated with good accuracy since, at the injection rates used, the gradients inside the injection tubing differed little from static gas gradients. In one case a pressure traverse was measured by running a pressure bomb in a 7-in. X 2?-in. OD annulus. The measured pressure at the injection point was in good agreement with the pressure calculated from the surface injection pressure. Liquid production from all wells was more than 98 percent water. Gas-liquid ratios ranged from 50 to 300 cu ft/bbl. The range of production rates that were correlated is shown in Table 1.CORRELATIONThe large-diameter, low gas-liquid ratio correlation is shown in Fig. 1. The data points for large-diameter tubing were correlated by the method developed by Poettmann and Carpenter.1In correlation of the casing-tubing annular flow data, the equivalent-diameter concept utilized by Benham and Pocttmnnn2 was used.

678,321211,,Uses of Transient Pressure Tests,S.C. Pitzer(Sun Oil Company),,,,,,API-64-115,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"Pressure transients, which result from drawdown, buildup, fall-off, or interference tests, contain much quantitative information about well and reservoir capabilities. Proper use of these tests permits the analyst to determine well-bore damage, effective permeability, static reservoir pressure, distances to boundaries or flow restrictions, inter-well porosity-thickness and, in some instances, reservoir size. This paper briefly presents theory, discusses equations, and shows examples of the various types of transient pressure tests. In addition, the paper discusses several anomalies which either mask the interpretation of a test or preclude an analysis altogether.INTRODUCTIONA static or stabilized reservoir may be described as an equilibrium system in which no pressure changes occur with time. This is not the case, of course, when the reservoir is undergoing depletion. Here the tern1 transient may be used to define the manner in which pressure varies with time throughout the reservoir. Normally, reservoirs undergoing depletion are considered to involve two distinct types of pressure decline -non-steady state and steady state. Steady-state transients result from the gradual depletion of reservoir pressure resulting from production. This decline is largely a material-balance loss involving only cumulative production, reservoir size, and fluid compressibilities. Under this condition pressure decline is related to time only through the production history. An analogy is the pressure decline which results when gas is vented from a pressurized tank. The pressure at any time in this tank is a function of the total gas vented, the volume of the tank, and the original pressure of the system. The rate of pressure decline in the tank is controlled completely by the rate of gas withdrawal.Non-steady-state transients are considerably more complex than steady-state behavior. Primarily this results from the fact that a petroleum reservoir does not behave like a tank with uniform pressure. Instead, since a porous formation is composed of capillaries which retard fluid movement, pressures vary widely across a reservoir. When a well is first placed on production, pressure immediately begins to drop in the vicinity of the well bore. Almost instantaneously a resultant pressure transient travels throughout the entire reservoir. However, for practical purposes, there is no measurable pressure drop some distance from the well until some time later. As a result, one may intuitively visualize a pressure drop being propagated with time into the reservoir. Fig. 1 is a logarithmic plot illustrating pressure profiles resulting from constant rate production in a hypothetical radial reservoir. In this figure, successive curves show the transient movement of the pressure drop with time. Further analysis of this graph also indicates that the pressure drop moves outward in time almost inversely with the radius squared until the pressure profile reaches the outer boundary. When the profile reaches the outer boundary, pressure performance exhibits a transition from non-steady- state to steady-state pressure decline. In the steady-state condition, pressure throughout the reservoir falls uniformly with time.A mathematical description of transient phenomena requires knowledge of certain fluid and reservoir properties. In the simplified case of a cylindrical reservoir containing a slightly compressible liquid.",,American Petroleum Institute

The 4-shot testing block, using more-powerful shaped charges, permits faster flow rates and improved fluid recoveries in wells in the Rocky Mountain area.Interpretation methods are presented for the prediction of the types and relative amounts of fluid to be expected on initial natural completion. Techniques for estimation of effective formation permeability, based upon flow rates into the sample recovery chamber, are also given. Finally, test data are used to predict the daily rate of production of both oil and gas wells. These interpretation methods are adapted for conditions encountered in wells of the Rocky Mountain area and are designed for easy application in the field. Examples from actual tests in this area are given.The wireline formation tester1is effective in the Rocky Mountain area. During the past 2 years, improved designs, new interpretation techniques, and increased local experience have combined to make wireline tests truly diagnostic. From tests in this area, it is usually possible to predict production-both the rate and the fluids of production. The purpose of this paper is to show these methods of interpretation and to illustrate their application in actual tests from the Rocky Mountain area.INTRODUCTIONThe wireline tester came to the Rocky Mountains after spectacular successes in the relatively soft formations of the Gulf Coast. However, since the local formations are generally of lower porosity, and drilling-mud invasion is generally deeper, the initial results in the Rockies were less diagnostic. In many instances only small fluid recoveries were achieved, even though the sample chambers were left open for relatively long periods of time. Needed were faster flow rates and improved methods of interpretation.TOOL MODIFICATIONSSeveral improvements in design were recently made to improve the fluid recovery characteristics of the formation interval tester. The first of these improvements increased to 4 the number of sampling holes. With the modified device the 4 shaped charges, spaced over a 2 1/2-ft vertical interval, are fired simultaneously. All of the holes thus created are open to the sample chamber. The increased number of holes not only shortens the time required to obtain sufficient fluid recovery, but also, in anisotropic formations, reduces the possibility of hitting only tight streaks. Statistical studies of a number of tests in formations similar to those of the Rockies indicated the 4-shot device led to recovery rates that averaged 1.93 times those obtained with only 2 shots. Further, these statistics also showed that, even though the number of seal pads doubled, there was only a slight increase in seal failures.Another design change permitted the use of more powerful and effective shaped charges. The first logging cable testing devices introduced in the Rocky Mountain area used 7/8-in. shaped charges. Although such charges are effective in shallowly invaded and relatively high porosity sands, they often give insufficient penetration for harder formations. Now 1 1/8-in. shaped charges are used; penetration is appreciably increased.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hopkinson(Lane-Wells Company),,,,,,API-64-156,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"A new type of nuclear log has been developed which responds to variations in the lifetime of thermal neutrons in formation materials. The log is particularly sensitive to the presence of chlorine and can reliably distinguish between oil-bearing and salt-water-bearing formations. Many wells have been logged in the Gulf Coast area during recent months. Typical performance characteristics and interpretation techniques are discussedINTRODUCTIONA new nuclear logging method has been recently introduced in the Gulf Coast area which can distinguish between brine and oil through casing. It utilizes a pulsed accelerator-type neutron source and a scintillation counter to measure the lifetime of thermal neutrons in formations by recording the intensity of neutron capture radiation during the interval between source pulses when neutrons in the bore hole have died away.1,2The log is called a Neutron Lifetime Log? and is based on the fact that, in ordinary rocks, thermal neutrons have a measurable lifetime which varies with variations in reservoir-fluid and rock characteristics.Actual results in commercial wells and test pits have demonstrated that the log has important advantages over other nuclear logs. It has been found to have better sensitivity to formation-fluid salinity than any other cased-hole log. As experience is gained in interpretation techniques, the new log is expected to be applicable to many formation-evaluation problems where other logs are inadequate. It has been found that, in general, there is a quantitative relationship between the log response and the fluid and rock properties. This makes it possible, in favorable cases, to measure fluid saturation quantitatively. Moreover, it is feasible to differentiate between oil and water zones even when bore-hole conditions are such that other logging methods would be inaccurate or inoperative.LOGGING-INSTRUMENT DESIGNThe logging instrument is 3 5/8 in. in diameter and 15 ft long, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The radiation detector is a scintillation counter housed in a stainless-steel dewar flask to ensure stable operation at elevated temperatures. The neutron source is a Lane- Wells Accelatron positioned below the detector and arranged to produce neutrons in repetitive bursts or pulses at a rate of 1,000 pulses per second. Each of these pulses is about 20 microseconds long, during which time about 105neutrons are emitted. These neutrons, each having an energy of 14 million electron volts, travel initially at very high speed but are promptly reduced to thermal energy by collisions with formation materials. Once thermalized, the neutrons diffuse about among the formation nuclei until, one by one, they are captured.Fig. 1 -Subsurface Instrument Used to Make the Neutron Lifetime Log(Available in full paper) It is 15 ft long and 3-518 in. in diameter.Many of the gamma rays emitted by the capturing nuclei may reach the scintillation counter, and the counting rate a t any particular instant is an indication of the number of live neutrons in the formation. The scintillation counter is gated in synchronism with the neutron-source pulse cycle so that it is turned on only during pre-selected intervals in the quiescent period between source pulses.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-64-213,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1964,"The single most important, and yet all-inclusive, new development in water flooding considering economic oil recovery, is the rapidly expanding application of the method to recently discovered oil reservoirs. Water injection is being started or is to be started before a significant amount of primary oil is produced. Other new developments in water flooding include: 1, improved well-completion, servicing, injection, and production practices; 2, an extended knowledge of the factors that affect water-flooding oil-recovery efficiency based upon both field and laboratory data; 3, use of better water-analysis testing equipment and methods; 6, a better understanding of fluid-fluid, fluid-rock, displacement and related phenomena; and 5, use of carbonated water and LPG slugs. Each of these factors is discussed and, where possible, correlated with field results.Recent developments in fracturing techniques include notching tools to initiate horizontal fracturing. Development of a controlled solubility polyphosphate used in conjunction with fracturing of producing wells retards the precipitation of carbonate and sulfate scale deposits in the formation near the well bore and thus provides longer sustained maximum producing well capacity. New developments in water treatment include improved bactericides and new water-analysis testing methods.Development of low-horsepower submersible pumps has improved oil recovery by facilitating low-cost operation of high-volume shallow wells, thus increasing the range of applicability of the submersible pump. Other significant equipment improvements include high-strength plastic line pipe, thin-wall line pipe, and the adaptation of automatic custody transfer and automation techniques to water-flooding operations.Factors that affect water-flooding recovery and performance are primary-recovery efficiency, oil saturation, crude-oil shrinkage, sweep efficiency, interstitial-water saturation, and water-injection rates. Others include reservoir structure, permeability, rock uniformity, oil viscosity, type of flood, rock wettability, and time of flood initiation. These factors are analyzed and attempts are made to correlate them with actual field results. Surface-active agents have not been proved to economically increase oil displacement, but do increase oil recovery through their use in improving injectivity and removing water blocks in producing wells. Several field tests show that the use of carbonated water results in improved injectivity and recovery, but the economic feasibility of this method has not been satisfactorily defined. The injection of an LPG slug followed by water is in its infant stage and shows promise of success under certain conditions.INTRODUCTIONNatural recovery mechanisms eave unrecovered 60 to 90 percent of the original oil in place. Secondary oil-recovery processes have been developed in efforts to recover all or part of this oil. Of these, water flooding -an artificial form of water drive-has been the most successful. It is applicable principally to many reservoirs where the primary oil-recovery mechanisms have not and will not produce more than about 20 to 30 percent of the original oil in place. This method of oil recovery has spread over the Mid-Continent, Southwest, and other oil-producing regions of the country so that today about 26 percent1of United States production is by water flooding. Similar, but perhaps less-intensified application of water flooding has occurred in Canada, Venezuela, Russia, and other countries.",,American Petroleum Institute

The water-content monitor will also monitor changes In water production so that remedial measures may be taken for optimum air- or gas-drilling operations.The water-content non nit or consists of an electronic assembly mounted on the air or gas return blooie line and a recorder-alarm unit situated on the drilling floor The water-content monitor is ruggedly designed, both for the general environment of a drilling rig and for the very abrasive flow conditions of the air or gas return blooie line. Use has been made of the instrument in drilling over a dozen wells, and water-content monitors are currently in continuous use on the air or gas drilling of company wells.INTRODUCTIONAir or gas drilling provides the fastest penetration rates attainable and is most effective m dry formations. The drill cuttings are returned to the surface in the form of particles ranging in size from fine dust to ? -in. chips The greatest problem associated with air or gas drilling is drilling through water-producing formation. When a low-flow-rate, water-producing formation is encountered, the drill cuttings usually become sticky and adhere to the drill string and borehole walls without being returned to the surface These cuttings accumulate rapidly and can cause the drilling string to stick m the hole Under these conditions surface returns of cuttings and fluid are not re-established until water and a foaming agent are injected into the input air or gas stream in a sufficient quantity that the combined flow of formation water and surface-injected water exceeds some minimum rate After returns are reestablished, mist or foam drilling can continue at a reduced penetration rate as long as hole conditions permit Many formations slough into the hole after being wetted during must or foam drilling. Water-shutoff attempts are made to minimize potential hole sloughing and to regain the higher penetration rates possible with dry drilling Chemical pretreatment of water-sensitive formations prior to the time when water is encountered can prevent or delay these formations from sloughing when contacted by water.During air or gas drilling , the blooie line discharge is watched closely Favorable dry drilling conditions are easily recognized by the presence of dust blowing from the end of the blooie line If dusting stops, but some air or gas is being returned, it is usually assumed that a water-producing formation has been encountered.

This paper discusses operating principles and characteristics of equipment needed to carry out an oilfield steaming program, except for the steam generator. Water-treating and handling equipment, flow lines, well heads, down-hole tools, and accessory items are covered.INTRODUCTIONWhether oil production is stimulated through the steam-soak (huff-and-puff) method or by well-to-well steam drive, there is more to the operation than just putting steam into the ground. Careful engineering of all phases of the operation is needed to avoid physical damage to surface equipment and injection wells, and chemical and mechanical damage to the reservoir Proper selection and application of equipment is one of the first steps in this careful engineering design, which covers the full range of operations from water treatment on the surface to injection of steam into the reservoir many feet underground.WATER TREATMENTTwo major differences between industrials team boilers and oil-field steam generators dictate the differences in feed-water treatment, Fig 1.Conventional industrial steam systems usually operate oil a closed cycle in which steam used for turbine operation, heating of buildings, etc is returned to the holler for conversion to steam again Oil-field steamers operate on a once-through basis, where all steam generated is injected into the reservoir, and never recycled. Only a small amount of makeup water is needed to replace that which is accidentally lost from a conventional boiler system, or that which is used to blow down the boiler but feed water for an oil-field steam generator must be continuously replaced on a 100-percent basis. Cost of water treatment for a conventional boiler system, on a unit basis, is not too important because of the small number of 'units involved, but this same cost might be prohibitive in the oil fields.Conventional steam boilers take the steam to the dry saturated condition, or into the super-heat region, whereas oil-field steam is wet - generally about 80-percent quality (80-percent in the vapor phase, 20-percent in the liquid phase).The first of these differences is a disadvantage; the second is a distinct advantageThe water-handling portion of a steam-injection system involves filtration, chemical treatment, storage, deaeration, conversion to steam, separation (optional), and metering (Fig 2)A description of equipment needed to treat feed water for oil-field steamers is impossible without some discussion of water-conditioning fundamentals, but no attempt will be made to cover the subject in detail as this has been clone adequately in recent publications1,2,3FiltersFeed water should be free of excessive suspended matter (non-ionic solids) to prevent contamination of subsequent treating equipment and plugging of parts of the system, including the sand face of the injection wellFig. 1 - Oil-field Steam-generating ProceduresRequire Unique Water-treatment (Available in full paper)Fig. 2 - Basic Components of a Steam-injection System, to the Well Head(Available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Summary tables of the results of the study are presented along with conclusions and comments as to the principal causes of leaks and suggestions regarding practices which should tend to minimize leak frequency.INTRODUCTIONThe occurrence of communications between pipe strings because of leaks or failures of one kind or another has long been a chronic ailment In the petroleum-producing industry. However in recent years, with the advent of high-pressure well completions and the use of well-stimulation techniques requiring high treating pressures, the problem of thread leaks has ceased to be a mere annoyance and has become a matter of major concern to many operators. This statement can best be appreciated by those who have had the experience of killing a gas well with 8,000 to 10,000 psi surface pressure because of a leak in a pipe string. Watching the pressure between strings rise toward a point above that for which the outer string was designed is certainly not habit-forming.About 13 years ago, during the development of the deep gas reservoirs In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, the author had several of these unhappy experiences, and, as a result, contributed in a small way toward the development of tools and techniques for hydraulically testing each tubing connection as the pipe was being run Since that time such methods have come Into wide usage as means of reducing thread leaks and now are more or less standard procedures with many operators, even on pumping wellsIn spite of the availability of numerous special connections incorporating various thread forms, seals, and devices for eliminating leaks, the problem is still with us. For this reason it appeared that an examination of the current situation as to the leak frequency being experienced at various test pressures, and the practices being used in preparing and running pipe , might shed some light on the problem and result in some conclusion of benefit to the industrySCOPE OF THE STUDYIn order that a study could be made, the Loomis Hydraulic Testing Co., Inc. agreed to make available the records on some 29,000 testing jobs involving about 9,000,000 joints of pipe 4s the study was planned to consider such Items as the amount of torque applied, the type of thread lubricant used, the time interval of each test, whether the tests were made above or below the rotary, and the methods by which the leaks were cured, many of the early records were lacking in sufficient detail and did not necessarily represent current practices.

Placement of the cement is accomplished down the drill pipe and up the annulus before coming out of the hole.The drill pipe is then removed from the well and the casing is lowered into a delayed-setting cementing slurry After the cement slurry is set, the well can be completed using conventional techniques This techniques could be used in tubingless-completion wells by placing the slurry clown one string and lowering multiple tubing strings into the unset cementINTRODUCTIONThe initial investigate of long-life cementing slurries began in the mid-1950's. It was desired to place a cement slurry in a well through drill pipe before coming out of the hole The production casing was then to be lowered into the unset cement. As this was before the development of effective low-water-loss materials, the only basic consideration was to delay the setting of the cement slurry so it would remain fluid for 3 to 4 days, but have adequate compressive strength in a prescribed period of time. The initial Idea was for possible use in shallow wells, where temperature would present no significant problem The delayed setting time was easy to achieve by the use of retarders, as illustrated In Table 1. It can be observed that approximately 1 percent lignosulfonate retarder In portland cement easily provided a long setting time at 80 F, yet produced adequate strength for bonding shortly after setting.Table 1 Setting Time - 80 F (Available in full paper)Table 2 Well Conditions - 5,600 Ft Static Temperature: 160 F Fluid Tirne: 24 Hours - Set in 7 Days Composition: API Class A Cement (Available in full paper)DEVELOPRIENT OF SLURRY DESIGNShould a permeable zone be encountered down the hole, resulting In a loss of fluid from the cement, a buildup of filter cake could prevent the placement of the pipe to the desired depth At shallow-well conditions, excessive retardation of the slurry could also be objectionable In delaying the completion of the well. Further work at elevated temperatures indicated that it was more difficult to prevent the slurry from thickening or setting while in a static condition It was found that low-water-loss control should be incorporated in the slurry in combination with retardation to fulfill the delayed-setting requirements In the slurry development it was also noted that the presence of bentonite was advantageous for better filter-cake control when static for long periods of time The development of more effective methods for controlling fluid loss improved the ease in design of a cementing slurry having fluid-loss control and retardation at elevated temperatures and pressures.Considering placement of slurries in tubingless-completion wells, the cement is displaced down the first string of tubing instead of down the drill pipe in order to conserve time",,American Petroleum Institute

Laboratory and field investigations show that formation damage frequently occurs when water invades low-permeability rocks.After testing 51 sandstone and dolomite cores in the laboratory, it was determined that water would block core samples in the permeability ranges from 0.2 to at least 526 md and that cores in the lower permeability ranges were more readily blocked. In the initial test, cores were blocked with water. In later tests, cores were blocked with kerosine and diesel oil or with a water-kerosine or water-diesel oil combination. In some tests water alone would not block the core, but with the addition of kerosine or diesel oil a block was formed. A variety of surfactants was tested In the laboratory to remove water or water-oil blocks from cores having permeability usually less than 100 md.Twenty gas-producing and storage wells were treated for the removal of water blocks. The alcohol-surfactant treating fluids applied in the field previously were studied In laboratory core tests. The treatments in most wells were designed to relieve the apparent water-blocked condition by contacting an approximate 1-ft section of the formation affected around the well bore.During initial field tests, the treating fluids were displaced into the affected formation by pipeline gas. Later, in lieu of high-pressure natural gas, or when gas was to available, carbon dioxide was used as the liquid-displacing medium because of its general availability and ease of handling. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the alcohol-surfactant method in relieving water-blocked conditions as shown by the increases in the rates of gas production from the wells tested. Results of this study extended the laboratory work reported by other investigators In addition, results from laboratory tests were applied in the field.",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper relates some past experiences under uncontrolled oil drilling and the present carefully devised techniques under which major oil companies have been permitted to develop oil deposits In built-up, high-value urban areas of Los Angeles.INTRODUCTIONAs a professional city planner and public official charged by law with certain important responsibilities incidental to carrying out the purpose and intent of our Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, which incidentally is designed to control and direct the growth of the city as an entity in an orderly, Intelligent manner, it is a real pleasure and welcomed opportunity for me to participate in this panel discussion with members of the American Petroleum Institute. There are many mutual problems which may be partially resolved by better understanding of each other's viewpoint and responsibilities.OIL DRILLING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT MIXTUREI seriously doubt that any well-qualified professional city planner would intentionally choose land on top of a known petroleum deposit as a site on which to plan a new urban community. Just as oil and water do not mix, neither do oil drilling and production readily mix with well-planned urban development. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending upon the viewpoint, oil can only be produced where nature and God deposited this valuable natural resource in early geological ages; and several of the most valuable of these deposits are found in California In many instances, intensive and valuable urban development has been intentionally planned and constructed directly above one of these deposits of black gold totally oblivious to the presence of this potential wealth and source of future headaches for property owners and public officials. And, although we would prefer that oil drilling and production be totally excluded from urban areas, particularly residential sections, sometimes such exclusion would be unreasonable and thus legally impossible. It has become the planner's duty, therefore, to make sure that, if oil drilling is permitted in such communities, it is allowed only under strict control and in compliance with regulations which will adequately protect the individual property owners, the surrounding neighborhood, the individual competing oil developers, and the people at large who have a vital stake In the conservation of this highly essential natural resource With the splendid cooperation received from the major oil producers, we have demonstrated this can be done.IMPACT OF URBAN DRILLING AND NEED FOR CONTROLThe City of Los Angeles was probably the first urban community to experience the Impact of uncontrolled oil development , and as a result has had to develop regulations to cope with the problems and minimize the adverse effect. I need not remind you of the chaotic results of the totally selfish, thoughtless, inefficient, unsightly",,American Petroleum Institute

Laurie(Union Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-65-045,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1965,"Present exploration and development drilling in urban areas is discussed and analyzed from the operator's viewpoint Basic principles of planning and directing urban operations are emphasized, and future trends and requirements are predicted on the basis of several years of rather extensive experience.It is demonstrated that proved methods now exist which permit both exploration and development drilling In urban areas-even those areas of most-advanced and well-regulated commercial or residential development The continuation of these same methods, improved by procedures and equipment now under development in the industry, is expected to meet the anticipated requirements of the near future.INTRODUCTIONDuring the past decade there has been a steady increase In modern, controlled oil-well drilling In urban areas More of this activity has occurred in Los Angeles, California, than in any other city in the world. Exploration drilling has been done over a widespread and diverse area of the city, and several oil pools have been discovered and subsequently developed - or are presently in the process of development.Although much of the following discussion is applicable to urban drilling in general, the background experience was gamed, almost exclusively, in the Los Angeles area. It should be noted that the term urban drilling , which is used repeatedly in this paper, refers in all cases to the type of modern, regulated operations presently being conducted-in contrast to the relatively uncontrolled townlot drilling of the past.FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLESThe uniqueness of urban drilling is derived, primarily, from the nature of the surroundings in which the operations are conducted The area of operations is one of established, relatively intense, residential and/ or commercial activity - activity that has not been regarded, historically, as compatible with oil-field operations. Drilling operations introduced into such an area must be planned and conducted with a view toward minimum disturbance and hazard to this existing activity. This may only be accomplished by establishing and maintaining good communications and cooperation between the principal parties involved, viz, the operator, the contractor, and the city Furthermore, a high level of operating efficiency (to reduce the time required to do the drilling) and maximum safety in drilling procedures (to protect life and property in the area) are necessary to achieve this objective. This justifies and requires the application of more engineering science than is normal in routine nonurban drilling.It is particularly noteworthy that these basic principles and objectives serve the best interest of all parties. Their acceptance is vital to a sound operating philosophy and to good operator-contractor-city relations The elements of efficiency and safety are economically favorable to both the operator and the contractor in that they reduce financial risk and increase profit.EXPLORATION DRILLINGDrilling has an unusually important function in urban, as opposed to nonurban, oil exploration. This is necessarily true since the use of some other exploration techniques, principally seismic shooting, is precluded or severely limited by the density of building covering the area of interest. This fact, coupled with the desirability (from the standpoint of both the operator and the city)",,American Petroleum Institute

The pipeline companies have established various criteria for: 1, acceptable quality and quantity measurements and gathering procedures; and 2, the equipment necessary to achieve these requirements. Although a great majority of these carriers are in agreement-to the extent that definite trends can be established, there are notable differences worthy of discussion and explanation for the benefit of the producer running oil (or contemplating running oil) through LACT equipment.INTRODUCTIONThe myriad advantages of to the oil producer have been the subject for many API and articles in trade journals.11-13, inclWithout On these attributes of a technique that has risen from oblivion to industry acceptance in less than a decade, it is well to briefly mention the basis for selection of lease automatic by producers. These advantages Include :Reduction in required lease storage (which also mean less investment in stored oil).Improvement of measurement accuracy.Reduction of the possibility of error in measurement or in quantity computation.Simplification of computation and accounting procedures.Reduction Of time required by pumpers in making measurements.Improved scheduling of runs on a predetermined basis.Allowing maximum use of other automatic equipment installed primarily for the production operationsIncreased operating efficiency and control.14The pipeline carrier of crude shares In many Of the advantages gained by the producer using LACT and, indeed, others The pipeline company must, however, shoulder the responsibility for delivering an acceptable fluid to the refiner. As such, the pipeline is held accountable as the agent of the refiner, to assure that quality and quantity standards are upheld. Often, the pipeline company must see that the production limitations are in keeping with state regulations.The responsibilities that befall the pipeline company have made it mandatory that certain requirements, or musts are adhered to by the producer. Reconciling the pipeline?s musts with the producer's wants frequently Proves difficult, but seldom impossible.Two recent surveys conducted among United States Crude-oil pipeline companies spell out the specific musts and provide an insight into the reasoning behind these demands.The two surveys were identical. The first was sent to all known United States crude-oil pipeline companies. The second was sent to respondents of the first survey for the purpose of detecting change in pipeline policies regarding LACT in the lapsed 6-month period.Questions asked in the survey can be placed in two definite categories. The first category was involved with the specific equipment requirements and catalogued by the pipeline company's name. The second category dealt with policy, techniques, and comments which the pipeline company was to remain nameless, and the data assembled from this portion of the survey were to be presented in generalized, summary form. It is interesting to note that 14 percent of the pipeline companies had altered company policy regarding its LACT",,American Petroleum Institute

Reinhold(Abegg Rinhold Co),,,,,,API-65-057,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1965,"Considerable work has been accomplished by joint committees of the American Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors and the American Petroleum Institute developing a standard drill-pipe grading system During the course of this work it became apparent that classification and grading of used drill pipe was not uniform, wide discrepancies existed in grading performed by different inspection companies who had difficulty reproducing their results, and there were no methods to measure wall thickness, determine cross-sectional are, and relate these findings to a recommended hook load. Crack detection and the ability to differentiate between cracks and pits was not consistent, and it was often noted that inspection personnel lacked sufficient training.Because drill-pipe inspection and grading relate to drill-string design, it became obvious no industry-wide consensus existed as to what constituted proper drill-string design. Discussions revealed many personnel in the drilling industry had incomplete knowledge of the basic factors limiting drill-string performance. Although considerable research exists relative to all types of fatigue failure, in most cases this information is not generally known and it is often misinterpreted. Although it is evident that much drill pipe is damaged because good practices are reflected, it is also true that the drill string is frequently abused -unintentionally- because the operator and contractor are unaware of stress levels to which it is subjected, especially with regard to cumulative fatigue damage Drill-pipe failures are costly for both the contractor and the operator and will not be minimized until the industry develops standard criteria for drill-string design and use.INTRODUCTIONThe American Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors adopted a standard classification system for grading used drill pipe at the Rotary Drilling Conferences held during January 1964. These standard classifications cover 4 &frac12; -in OD, Grade E, 16 6-lb/ft drill pipe and 5-in.OD, Grade E, 19 5lb/ft drill pipe . They were submitted to the American Petroleum Institute at the standardization meetings in June 1964 and, with slight modifications, the API Task Group on Grading Used Drill Pipe accepted the work of the AAODS. The grading system has now been adopted as a tentative standard in its present state of development and has been published as an appendix inAPI std 7 : Specification for Rotary Drilling EquipmentIt is therefore, significant for all users of drill pipe to understand and commence using this new API-AAODS drill-pipe grading system.

Odessa Texas),,,,,,API-65-066,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1965,"This paper reports the application of a new tool, designed in accordance with packed-hole principles, to practically and economically eliminate doglegs and effectively minimize the rate of change in hole deviation. Additional functions such as the elimination of under sized spiral holes and ledges are discussed. The beneficial effect on rock-bit life is noted.The possibility that this assembly creates a self-compensating effect actually tending toward straightening hole, while simultaneously performing the other beneficial functions, is considered. Advantages and disadvantages of the near-bit stabilizer-sub assembly are pointed out and examined, Actual field performance in server areas is presented and the economic advantages of the assembly are illustrated.INTRODUCTIONIt has not yet become possible to drill a vertical hole as rapidly as one somewhat less vertical. This being the case, recent studies have been toward limiting the rate of change of angle, rather than the angle itself. It is now an accepted fact that the slant of a hole is not necessarily bad for either drilling or producing operations. Limited-angle drilling contracts in no way assure the operator of a hole that is free of the other hazard attributed to deviated holes. Problems of under-sized holes, abrupt dog-legs, ledges, and spiraled holes are not solved by rigid deviation control. This concept has led to a relaxation of overall deviation limitations on the part of many operators.Along with this liberalization of maximum allowable hole angle has come an increased emphasis on eliminating the other hazards. Various types of bottom-hole assemblies have been developed and utilized to this end Invariable these assemblies are based on the packed-hole concept of limiting the rate of changes of hole angle. The packed-hole technique not only performs this function, but also minimizes or eliminates the other hazards. Thus, the use of a proper bottom-hole assembly adds much to the feasibility of more relaxed deviation restrictions.Methods of packing the hole have varied from the use of large-diameter round drill collars, through various reamer-stabilizer hookups and ribbed drill collars, to the use of square drill collar with corners rounded off to a dimension 3/16 in under hole size.The equipment discussed in this paper performs all the functions required of any packed-hole assembly and, at the same, offers several additional advantages.MULTIPLE-STABILIZER PACKED-HOLE ASSEMBLIESThe principle behind a packed-hole assembly is, of course, to resist changes in hole angle by restricting lateral bit movement. The effectiveness of a packed-hole assembly is determined by: 1, diametrical difference; 2, length or stabilizer placement; 3, stiffness; 4, effectiveness of wall support.With zero diametrical difference, sufficient length, a very stiff assembly, and absolute wall support, it would be impossible for the hole to deviate from that plane in which it was originally started. This set of conditions, however, will never exist in reality.Diametrical DifferenceIt is impossible to maintain zero diametrical difference. Bits tend to drill slightly over-gage hole. The API tolerance on nominal bit size is to the plus side. The walls of the hole tend to wash and erode.",,American Petroleum Institute

With the use of drill-stem testing at deeper and deeper depths (12,000 to 2O,OOO+ ft ) , loading on mechanical components has become critical It is therefore necessary that we formulate an approach to DST applications beyond previous experience levels.This review presents an intensive planning approach It does so by using a systematic planning outline with check-off lists for the significant steps involved The check-off lists are supplemented by discussion of salient points which serves to summarize the state of the art (experience) and to list criteria for extending experience to deeper applicationsIn applying this review to specific wells,considerable judgment will be required to determined which of the many factors reviewed are critical, which can be disregarded, and what intensity of detail planning can economically be justifiedPLANNING FOR DRILL-STEM TESTINGIn reviewing many recent unsuccessful drill-stem tests, the failures all had some technical explanation However, generally underlying the technical problems was poor planning. The following three points are made in this connection because they govern to a large degree whether this review on the mechanical aspects of drill-stem testing will serve to Improve the success ratio and lower costs and risk exposure:Initial planning for DST should start when the well is being planned. Last-hour improvisation should be avoided.Appropriate manpower and technical skills commensurate with the value, expense, and risk of the DST should be used Considerable effort can be justified when one considers. a, the value of the decisions based on DST data, b, the expense of the tests which at depth can run from $5,000 to $15,000 and c, the risks to personnel, equipment, and the hole.Planning and execution of a DST should not depend upon the abilities and knowledge of just one person. A high degree of coordination and cooperation between drilling operations, the petroleum engineers or geologists responsible for evaluating the well, the drilling engineers who set up the DST, and service-company personnel is essential. Service-company personnel have a wealth of experience and can be of immeasurable help if they know what is to be done early in the planning stage. Operating companies should strive to become proficient at fully utilizing, .not duplicating, the knowledge of the DST service companies. This can best be clone by a clear and detailed definition of objectives and problems.The following steps are proposed for planning the mechanical aspects of drill-stem testing at depth.DEFINING THE PROBLEMIn planning the mechanical aspects of a drill-stem test, the starting point is the evaluation program for the well.",,American Petroleum Institute

One manner of accomplishing this is through service contracts.A services contract is one between an operator and an individual or a company covering routine types of work on a lease The work is usually performed with the service company's equipment and under the direction of its foreman or supervisor Common examples of work covered by service contracts are building roads, clearing locations, coring, drill-stem testing, acidizing, perforating and essentially all other operations on the lease except the actual drilling of the wells.All individual company service contracts examined in preparation of this paper contained provisions pertaining to the type of work to be performed, the price to be paid, the commencement and completion dates, and other similar provisions which are quite familiar There are two provisions, however, to which not much attention may have been paid, but which are extremely Important and which should be of particular Interest to the producer.

In view of the wide use of oil-base mud systems in deep, high-temperature, problem well conditions, it is surprising that virtually nothing is contained In the technological literature to help the oil operator with the specific problems of evaluating formations penetrated with a nonconductive mud Presented is a compilation of procedures and ideas which can be helpful in evaluating formations drilled with oil-base mud.

Weintritt(Baroid Div National Lead Co),,,,,,API-65-098,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1965,"The drilling of wells to depths of 20,000 ft and greater has necessitated attention to the performance of muds subjected to temperatures of 400 to 500 F and hydrostatic pressures of 10,000 to 20,000 psi. Special laboratory instruments have been developed to permit the testing of muds a t elevated temperature and/or pressure, but most of these instruments are limited as to the extent to which actual well conditions are simulated.This paper discusses the factors that affect performance of muds in deep wells in relation to the equipment that is available for the testing of these muds. Examples are given to illustrate that subjecting a mud to elevated temperature without a reasonable simulation of pressure, time, and flow conditions can be very misleading.INTRODUCTIONThe 20,000-ft well that was first an interesting possibility, then a rarity, is now a fairly frequent challenge to those concerned with the prediction and control of drilling-mud performance. One obvious and well-recognized aspect of that challenge is that the drilling mud must sometimes withstand extremely high temperatures. Actually the drilling of a very deep well presents a number of other problems that combine to make mud control important but difficult.Control of RheologyThe very distance that drilled cuttings must be transported In a deep well places a demand for careful control of mud rheology. In shallower wells drilled in competent formations the velocity of the mud in the annulus is often adequate for good hole cleaning regardless of the viscosity. Annular velocity in a deep well, however, is likely to be limited by the pump power available, much of this power being expanded in pumping the mud down the long string of drill pipe. Hole enlargement also lessens annular velocity, and the deep well is likely to experience some hole enlargement simply because of the time that long sections of open hole are exposed. As pointed out by Walker1the ratio of plastic viscosity (PV) to yield point (YP) is an important factor in hole cleaning when mud is in laminar flow. Better cuttings removal would be expected, at a given annular velocity, as the ratio is decreased. To avoid greater pressure drop in the drill pipe, this adjustment of ratio should be accomplished by lowering the plastic viscosity and raising the yield point. Attention to mud rheology becomes very important then, in providing good hole cleaning in a deep well.Control of rheology in a deep well is also very important in avoiding loss of mud to the formation (pressure drop in the annulus can be quite large because of the depth), and in providing adequate hydraulics at the bit for reasonable drilling rate. For these purposes maximum fluidity is desired, and sometimes necessitates a compromise with hole cleaning.Control of Gel StrengthEven with close attention to rheology, some cuttings will remain in the hole when circulation is stopped. The extra time required to pull the pipe and go back in the hole with a new bit results .",,American Petroleum Institute

The equation allows the calculation of the amount of tracer required for a given producing- peak concentration.For the field test, ammonium thiocyanate and potassium iodide were injected into the center well of an inverted 2 &frac12; -acre 5-spot as a concentrated slug. The 4 producing wells were sampled every 3 hours for 9 days, every 4 hours for 8 days, every 6 hours for 6 days, and daily for 12 days. During the test the injection and producing rate remained almost constant. The samples were analyzed in the field for thiocyanate and iodide and returned to the laboratory for more precise analyses. In the laboratory a few samples were also analyzed for ammonium Ion.The test results compared favorably with predicted values, indicating that the equations can be used in the future with some degree of confidence. Apparently neither thiocyanate nor iodide ions were absorbed in this test. The limited amount of data indicates that the ammonium ion lagged both the thiocyanate and iodide. The laboratory analyses were within 1 ppm, while the routine field determinations were within 5 ppm.INTRODUCTIONIt is important that maximum recovery be obtained from a water-flood, and any quantitative information about a reservoir should help the reservoir engineer. To help obtain more specific information about a formation being flooded, a prediction technique was developed that would quantitatively predict the behavior of a tracer in the reservoir. A field test was designed to evaluate the prediction technique and to compare the results using two chemical tracers.Water-flood tracers have been used for many years. Several patents covering the use of specific chemicals for tracers have been issued.1,2,3However, there is little published data available concerning results of tracer use. Most of the data that have been published reported the use of tracers to confirm or deny suspected fractures or channel flow.4,5,6No attempt has been made to predict quantitatively the behavior of a tracer for different reservoir conditionsNo data were found which reported direct comparison of two or more tracers under field conditions. Greenkorn7reported laboratory core experiments comparing several chemical tracers. He concluded that perhaps four ~ o n s (bromide, iodide, thiocyanate, and nitrate) could be used as chemical tracers In additional to these, he suggested that chloride be monitored and used as a reference tracer.Most of the tracer experiments reported in the literature did not attempt to determine the accuracy or precision of analysis of the tracer used. No data were found indicating the limit of detection of a chemical tracer in an oil-field brine.Considerable data are available on suggested uses of radioactive tracers4At the tune of this test it was our opinion that the specla1 handling and analyses problems made them unsuitable for wide field use.

Hower(Halliburton Co.DuncanOkla),,,,,,API-65-113,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1965,"The use of water in hydraulic fracturing has gained in popularity during the past years . Where the formation being fractured is water-sensitive and the only water available to conduct the fracturing operation is relatively fresh, it has been necessary to chemically treat the water to minimize damage Hydrichloric acid and calcium chloride have been extensively used and have performed in a satisfactory manner under most circumstances. However, these chemicals may cause release of formation fines or develop clay flocs that can restrict the flow of fluids in the formation and the propped fracture It has been found that a potassium salt can be used to effectively and economically treat fresh waters to minimize formation damage caused by clay swelling, sloughing, and flocculation. Several laboratory test methods, such as flow tests, X-ray diffraction studies, and stability of formation samples under various fluid environments were utilized in a research program The quantity of potassium chloride required to maintain the formation clays near their original condition was relatively small Many wells have been successfully fractured where the water contained 0.8 percent to 3.0 percent by weight of potassium chloride.INTRODUCTIONThe use1of water in hydraulic-fracturing processes for stimulation purpose has grown rapidly since 1955.This Trend is illustrated in Fig 1 The economic advantage of using an inexpensive carrying fluid, such as water, to place propping agents is obvious. Also, the added safety of using a nonflammable liquid is desirable , as are the lower horsepower requirements resulting from the use of efficient friction-reducing agents in a lower-viscosity fluidMany operators were reluctant to use water at first particularly fresh water, since the productivity of numerous well in the past had been reduced by the inadvertent introduction of water into certain formations These horizons that showed permeability reduction are usually called water-sensitive formations. An excellent paper ,sup&gt;2 has described these formations and a method of determining degrees of formation water sensitivity . The approximate amount of permeability change caused by water invasion can also be determined. Briefly , a water-sensitive formation is defined as a formation where a reduction in permeability is cause by the swelling of clays or by the dispersion and movement of fine particles after contact by water that is foreign to the formation.There are certain clay minerals that will swell when contacted by fresh water and thus reduce the size of the flow channels in the formation. The clays that swell to the greatest degree belong to the montmorillonite group. There are other clays minerals of this type are illute, chlorite, kaolmute, and mixed layer.",,American Petroleum Institute

Free-piston gasifiers, using lease crude oil as fuel, offer the following advantages :Utilizes fuel with the lowest cost per equivalent Btu.Relates a major operating expense to a fluctuating product value.Utilizes a fuel source which is directly related to the life of the project.Other advantages include high plant reliability, flexibility of load with respect to demand, and the absence of lubricants In the compressed-air stream.Although the plant is not operational at this writing, it is anticipated that the advantages noted, i.e. , operating costs and operating characteristics, will be proved within a short period of time.INTRODUCTIONMobil Oil Co. initiated a combustion-recovery project on it Ms o co lease, in the Midway Sunset Field, during January 1960. Within 2 years, two additional projects were initiated in separate zones on this lease. By May 1964 four more projects were started in other fields. All of these projects required compressors.The first compressor installation was a 350-hp natural- gas-fired angle engine. As the various projects were expanded, additional machines were installed. To date, 10,400 hp have been installed-5,500 hp on the Moco lease.Expansion of the projects, particularly at Moco, Indicated the need for the installation of larger Increments of compressor horsepower. Continued installation of gas-engine-driven machines would require large volumes of natural gas, which may not be economically available on a long-term basisA study was undertaken to determine the size and type of equipment that would best suit the compressor needs for large combustion-recovery projects. Among the considerations used to select the equipment are the following.Low First Cost - Equipment costs and installed cost should be at least equivalent to that experienced with reciprocating machines.Burn Crude OilCrude 011 to be used as the primary fuel source because of lowest cost and highest availability Fuel expense will, therefore, be directly proportional to the product value during the life of the project This would not be the case for other energy sources.

Equipment to have a high degree of stability. Plant availability to be 95 percent or better.Operating and maintenance expense, excluding fuel, to be more favorable than with existing reciprocating equipment.Equipment to be suitable for unattended operation Twenty-four-hour attendance not to be maintained during the life of the plant.

This test is valuable in proving additional locations for development wells.INTRODUCTIONA reliable determination of the probable reserves is essential to the economic development of non-associated, dry-gas reservoirs. The reserves can be determined with reasonable accuracy for highly permeable, volumetric reservoirs when sufficient data are available to characterize, the reservoir behavior. For low-permeability reservoirs, the determined of reserves is more complicated , and it is subject to greater uncertainty. Some of the objective of this investigation are to evaluate the methods commonly used to estimate non-associated gas reserves in developed reservoirs, to examine in detail some of the inadequacies of the present methods, and to note some misunderstandings concerning the behavior of gas reservoirs which are pertinent to reserve estimation.Recently, owing to rising field development costs, it has become imperative in development planning that reasonable reserve estimates be available very early in the life of the field. In fact, it is often necessary to obtain a reserve estimate based only on the results of tests made on a discovery well Therefore, another objective of this investigate is to suggest improvements m the interpretation of one-well testsCOMMON METHODS OF RESERVE ESTIMATIONThe techniques most commonly used to estimate recoverable non-associated gas reserves are the volumetric method, the application of a direct material balance, and the analysis of decline curves. When sufficient data are available, the reserve estimations obtained using two or all three of the methods may be used to determine the most probable value of the reserves This approach appears to be particularly useful if each of the individual estimates is weighed In accordance with its reliability. Although the reservoir-limit test, a more novel method, is not so commonly used as the other methods, it is an extremely powerful tool in reserve estimation and development planning during the early life of a gas reservoir.The Volumetric MethodIn the evaluation of developed fields, i.e. field for which the productive limits have been defined, the volumetric method is quite suitable. Generally, this type of evaluation is made by determining, first, the amount of gas in place; and then estimating the percentage of this gas which re recoverable.The gas in place is given exactly by the following equationFormula available in full paper",,American Petroleum Institute

In fact, the petroleum business In this country was over 80 years old before a formal attempt was made to train management, supervisors, and field personnel In the various functions of their jobs The first formal attempt was made when Carl Young, then Director of the Division of Production of the API, and several other interested parties called on James Eddy, now Dean of the Division of Extension of the University of Texas, In 1943, to discuss the approach for the development and presentation of training programs to the industryThey discovered the approach to getting these programs accepted by the industry had to be a sneaky one They had to be sold as a safety program. Operating companies and drilling companies could readily evaluate the effect of a safety program in their rates for workmen's compensation and casualty insurance, but apparently could not estimate the benefit possible out of the increased efficiency and productivity of the individual employee As a result of this attitude, a mechanical maintenance program, a steam power program, and even a program on oil-field mathematics (equivalent of eighth grade arithmetic) were all sold to the Industry under the guise of safety programs The companies bought this pitch and the men bought it, too.Just prior to World War II, M.-L. Powers was working for the Extension Division of Oklahoma A M College. He had sold one of the larger oil companies In Oklahoma on a training program for their roustabouts, switchers, and pumpers. After attempting to present the program in two areas, it fell flat. The men signed up, made the first session, but failed to appear for the following sessions A quick survey by personal interview of the men enrolled brought to light the fact that the foremen were knocking the program. The foremen made no bones about asking the men who had signed up if they were trying to get his-the foreman's-job. It was not too subtly suggested to the men that this might be a good way to get run off. Powers had to change his whole approach to the problem He went to the company and secured permission to train farm bosses, head roustabouts, and chief gagers. After convincing this group their jobs would look better to management if they had better-trained and more efficient men under them, he was able to go ahead with his original program with the support of the foremen Thus was horn the first of the oil-field supervisory programs, which came into full flower right after the war.",,American Petroleum Institute

Oil recovery from a single cycle of injection and production is discussed and a theoretical method of calculating oil recovery is shown with an example. The major components of steam-stimulation costs are listed A generalized correlation of reservoir- oil viscosity vs. temperature is presented in a form convenient for use in steam-stimulation work.INTRODUCTIONSteam stimulation has caught the fancy of the petroleum industry. The idea is not new because the effect of temperature on crude-oil viscosity has been known since the days of Colonel Drake Early-clay patents concerned the injection of steam to reduce viscosity and clean up paraffin deposits around the well bore.There has been a cloak of secrecy surrounding steam-stimulation activities, motivated by the hope of acquiring producing properties susceptible to the steam-stimulation technique Many of the reasons for secrecy are now gone As a matter of fact, many of the sellers have a fear of missing out on something and are asking prices that may be over and above the actual worth of the property.It is important that the oil Industry break through the darkness and mysticism surrounding steam stimulation. This paper is presented as an encouragement to others to publish and exchange information, and to put steam stimulation In its rightful place as a valuable means of improving recovery and profitability of the more viscous oilsWHAT IS STEAM STIMULATION?Steam stimulation is the addition of thermal energy to a reservoir by steam injection. The same well is used for injection and production. The primary object of the steam injection is to get heat to the bottom of the hole and lower oil viscosity. The rock a t the bottom of the well acts as a heat exchanger and permits storage of heat from the injection cycle, to be used effectively as the oil is produced back into the wellThe petroleum industry, with characteristic humor, has given this process many different names. Some people call it huff-and-puff ; others know it as steam soak ; still others call it the cyclic method . Regardless of what it is called, this process represents a real breakthrough in the oil-producing business and is the newest form of secondary recoveryIt is secondary recovery because it is the addition of energy to a reservoir-heat energy and lots of it. In 1948, Norris Johnston and N. van Wingen defined secondary recovery as the recovery by any method of that petroleum which enters a well as a result of augmentation of the native reservoir energy, as by fluid injection. 1As an illustration of the relative amounts of energy added to an oil reservoir by various existing and proposed methods, consider Table 1.During the short time it takes to Inject steam into a well, it is apparent that a great deal of energy is injected Economically, it is hard to beat steam stimulation as a method of heat injection",,American Petroleum Institute

Laboratory and field evidence indicates that these materials can expand and/or improve these treatments in the following applications:Temporary diverting agents in hydraulic-fracturing operations to permit propagation of multiple fractures, even in liner or open-hole completions.Temporary spacers for permanent proppants in fractures to provide a partial monolayer of proppant with improved fluid conductivity.Fluid-loss control in fracturing operations to propagate maximum areal extent with minimum fluid.Temporary wellbore diverting agents in pressure-acidizing or other well washes to permit coverage of the entire producing interval with minimum fluid by sealing thief zones as they develop.Lost-circulation control in chilling or workover operations.In these applications, the complete solubility of the treating agent in crude oil results in little or no permanent formation damage. Selection of the proper combination of particle size, melting point, and oil solubility permits the application of this technique in a wide variety of stimulation treatments. Case histories illustrating these applications are presented.INTRODUCTIONHydraulic-pressure treatments of oil wells may be divided into three classes:Formation fracturing to enlarge the effective wellbore diameter or drainage area.Flushing to remove plugging materials from perforations or from the formation matrix near the wellbore.Solution of plugging materials or a portion of the matrix to improve formation conductivity.Each of these types of treatment can and should increase well productivity if the well problem is accurately diagnosed and if the proper treatment is effectively applied. Unfortunately, many oil-well pressure treatments fall short of the desired results. Assuming that the problem has been defined and the proper treatment has been selected, many treatments still fail because of Inability to place the treatment properly. In the producing interval. Low-pressure or high-permeability intervals may readily accept the treating fluids, While the remainder of the producing interval may receive little or no benefit from the treatment.Mechanical control of the treatment placement is possible in cemented liner completions if the cement is competent. Limited-entry techniques, packers, bridge plugs, ball sealers, and other similar methods have been used successfully in certain applications. These methods are often slow, tedious, and expensive.Open-hole or liner completions require a different approach. High-rate-high-volume treatments have been used in an attempt to exceed the fluid-carrying capacity of the more permeable zones and thus force a portion of the treatment to tighter intervals. A logical extension of this method is the addition of diverting or lost-circulation control agents to reduce the volume and cost of the treatment.Laboratory and field experience with hydraulic-pressure treatments of oil wells has led to the conclusion that many of these treatments could be improved through use of controlled oil-so1uble-water-insoluble diverting agents.

Harrison(Standard Oil Co of California Western Operations Inc.)|S.O. Hutchison(Standard Oil Co of California Western Operations Inc.),,,,,,API-66-007,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"A low-density (&plusmn;2 Ib/cu ft) foam has been developed that is stable in the presence of oil and salt water and can remove drilled and produced solids at low annular velocities which do not cause excessive open-hole erosion in unconsolidated formations. The low volumes used reduce compressor requirements and open up a market for gases that are easily liquefied. Fire hazards are reduced in a hydrocarbon environment, because the stable foam completely entraps the gaseous phase. The extremely low hydrostatic pressures that can be achieved with stable foam permit excellent formation evaluation and minimize formation damage while penetrating low-pressure formations. Full circulation has been maintained with stable foam in areas where conventional fluids have had complete loss of returns. The use of stable fluids has application as a low-pressure completion and sand-cleanout fluid.INTRODUCTIONThe removal of drilled solids while penetrating low-pressure hydrocarbon-producing formations and the subsequent removal of produced solids has continued to be a problem for the oil industry, particularly when the formations are unconsolidated and very permeable. The methods generally used to cope with these problems have been to drill into the low-pressure productive formations using:, cable tools;, native fluids selected for their compatibility with the formations into which they would invade;, fluids with good wall-cake-building properties; and, air or natural gas as the circulating fluid.A bailer run on a wire line has continued to be the standard method of removing produced solids. The chief disadvantage of these methods is that the drilled solids are generally displaced back into the productive formations and their subsequent removal cannot be assured because of the low energy level of the invaded formation. Therefore, the return permeability is adversely affected. The bailer can effectively remove produced solids from relatively large-diameter well bores only when static conditions are approached. A stable foam has been developed that can effectively remove drilled and produced solids from unconsolidated, permeable, and low-pressure hydrocarbon-producing formations. This method offers promise of solving some problems which have previously precluded the economic production of hydrocarbons.HISTORYIn March 1958, two wells were drilled in the Taft, Calif. area to evaluate the feasibility of using air and natural gas as a low-pressure completion fluid in order to optimize production from low-pressure hydrocarbon producing formations. These tests used compressed air and natural gas in sufficient volumes to achieve mist drilling velocities ( &plusmn; 3,000 ft/min annular velocity). These tests were unsuccessful because the high-velocity gases eroded the unconsolidated formations to such a degree that hole stability and cleaning could not be achieved. Fluid had to be added to keep the well bores open so perforated liners could be run.In June 1962, a program was initiated at Kettlemen Hills in which compressed natural gas was used to drill the completion intervals.1Sufficient volumes of gas have been used to dust and mist drill (&plusmn; 3,000 ft/min annular velocity). Hole stability has not been a problem in the completion intervals in this field because the formations have been rather firm.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dietrich(Continental Oil Company Durango Colo)|Paul Willhite(Continental Oil Company),,,,,,API-66-014,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"Continental Oil Company has applied the steam-soak process to wells completed in the Sisquoc S8-S17Areservoir in the Cat Canyon oil field, Santa Barbara County, California. This paper presents the results of first-cycle steam-soak and hot-water stimulations, with a detailed examination of four individual well responses to the process. This new method of thermal recovery, normally applied to accelerate oil production from low-gravity, viscous oil reservoirs at shallow depths, has been extended to depths in excess of 3,500 ft. The high injection pressures and temperatures (2,100 psig and 643 F) required to inject steam at a depth of about 3,500 ft into the Sisquoc Pool have been responsible for severe casing damage in wells cased with Grade J-55 steel connected with standard 8 round couplings. New well completions have been modified and existing wells have been stimulated for short periods by altering the injection-tube geometry and applying insulating conditions between the casing and the injection tubing. Production response to small treatments has been good in some situations, but large-volume steam stimulation would appear to generate more incremental oil.It is imperative that a low-cost means of providing casing protection for injection at these high temperatures be developed to maximize the process profitability. Inasmuch as most well completions in the Sisquoc Pool to date have been made with Grade J-55 steel with standard connections, the economic incentive for a large-scale application of this process must be related to the ability to inject into these wells for extended periods without damage to the casing.The effect of wellbore cleanup with the steam-soak process has been very important. In the authors' opinion, it is equally as important as the effect of viscosity reduction and thermal swelling, especially with regard to short-term injection. This is especially true in the Sisquoc Pool at Cat Canyon, where the reservoir sand and fluid conditions are such as to gradually contribute to a decreasing primary producing rate because of silt movement and possible asphaltine deposition around the wellbore.INTRODUCTIONIn January 1965, a thermal-stimulation project was initiated on the United California lease, Cat Canyon Field, Santa Barbara County, California, utilizing steam as a carrying agent to transport heat to the producing zone. The incentives to develop steam as a successful stimulation technique were:, to accelerate the production of primary reserves; and, to recover more oil from the reservoir.The first of these objectives has been accomplished, but the magnitude of additional oil to be recovered by this process of steam soaking is still to be determined.RESERVOIR INFORMATIONGeological ConditionsThe area of the Sisquoc Pool discussed in relation to thermal stimulation is located on the southwest flank of the large Cat Canyon anticline which plunges northwestward under the surface alluvium of the Santa Maria Valley. The top of the zone of interest is designated locally as the Ss electric-log marker and extends to the marker, for a gross average thickness of 300 to 500 ft. Net sand is, at best, an approximation of this gross interval; but conventional sand-shale differential techniques indicate that a net sand average of 150 to 175 ft, with a range between 100 and 400 ft, may be realistic.",,American Petroleum Institute

Huitt(Gulf Research and Development Company),,,,,,API-66-025,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"Wellbore heat loss, steam condensation rate, and casing temperature during wet steam injection can be predicted with existing theory, but tedious calculations are necessary for accurate results. However, the calculations can be handled graphically-and are so presented here--covering all practical injection pressures, injection periods, and tubing-casing combinations. Equations on which the graphs are based, together with conductivity and emissivity data, were taken from the literature. Modes of heat transfer from tubing to casing, i.e., radiation, conduction, and convection, are briefly discussed. Radiation is by far the largest, and any scheme for reducing heat loss and casing-temperature rise should take this into account. Heat transfer from tubing to casing was checked experimentally and found to agree well with predictions. The worst case was only 15 percent higher than predicted; usually the difference was much less.INTRODUCTIONThe success of saturated steam stimulation of shallow oil wells has prompted operators to steam deeper wells. In deeper wells (3,000 ft and more), the patterns of heat-loss decline and casing-temperature rise are similar to those in shallow wells, i.e., with time, changes become less, although steady state is never reached. However, in deep wells, heat losses are surprisingly high; and large steam generators are needed to get even a small fraction of the injected saturated steam to bottom hole. Also, the deeper the well, the more important even a moderate rise in casing temperature becomes for wells in which the casing is not cemented over its entire length. Casing not cemented, yet not free to expand, presents the danger of failure by buckling.Methods of predicting wellbore heat loss and casing temperature rise have been published. For instance, Ramey1,2presented the necessary equations and some examples, but referred to McAdanis3 for wellbore heat transfer coefficients. Some heat-loss data were published by Leutwyler and Bigelow4in their study of casing stresses. Satter5considered superheated steam injection and included a few examples for saturated steam. Bleakley6recently gave simple equations in which an average heat-transfer coefficient was used. These published articles are very useful; however, the prediction methods require either tedious calculations or sacrifice in accuracy. In this paper, the calculations are replaced by a series of graphs, without sacrifice in accuracy. From the graphs, wellbore heat loss, steam condensation rate, and casing-temperature rise at any time can be read directly. The graphs are based on published equations and cover almost any case of saturated steam injection which may be encountered in the field. Tubing-to-casing heat transfer was checked experimentally and found to agree well with predictions.HEAT LOSSESThe rate of heat loss in the wellbore and the casing temperature rise depend upon the manner in which steam is injected, i.e., down tubing or down the casing. For injection down casing, the heat loss is always higher than for injection down tubing. This is because steam condenses on the casing wall, which is quickly heated to the saturated steam temperature.",,American Petroleum Institute

Design problems in casing these wells have necessitated the use of liners sometimes up to four in one well. The casing design normally consists of 20-in. surface pipe, a 13 3/8-in. intermediate string, a 10 3/4-in. intermediate string, and then a series of liners set from the bottom of intermediate casing to total depth. In this paper, concern is primarily with the methods of hanging and cementing liners and the reasons they are run. The first major consideration in planning a well is the formation to be drilled. The nest is how it will be cased. Drilling conditions for the Delaware Basin are briefly discussed. Potential lost circulation and blowout zones are mentioned. Likely casing points have been picked.At any casing point below intermediate casing, an operator has a choice between a full string of pipe and a liner. Consideration must be given to several factors. The four most important are:. Evaluation of hydraulics available with each casing program.. Cost of casing, especially in wildcat areas.. Study of cementing methods available with each casing program.. Weight of casing string to be set.Liner equipment is available to permit tying back a full string of casing from the top of the liner to the surface, should this be required. Many of the deeper wells have drilling programs set up to use multiple liner settings. The oblivious problems of depth have been encountered in running and setting liners. Some of these problems and how they have been solved are discussed. Tools have been developed to permit running liner hangers and packers through previously set liners. The tools are now used extensively. A new cementing technique has been used with success to prevent failures resulting from high-pressure gas migration causing honeycombing of cement. This procedure is discussed and illustrated.INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to outline a liner setting and cementing program suitable for ultra-deep Delaware Basin wells. Included are typical installation procedures and types of liner equipment. Also covered are some problems which have occurred, some which might occur, and, it is hoped, solve solutions to these problems. The ultra-deep Delaware Basin is an area in West Texas extending from Loving and Winkler Counties southeastward through Ward, Reeves, and the western portion of Pecos County. Wells discussed in this paper will be those deeper than 20,000 ft. It is not impossible to drill very deep wells without cementing one or two liners ; but most operators drilling in the Delaware Basin have found liner hanging almost a necessity.

Field results of improved bond strength in cased holes are illustrated by the use of acoustic cement bond logs and pressure testing with hydraulic fluids. The improvement of the bond strength of the pipe to cement interface is achieved by altering the external surface of the pipe to provide a rough surface. This is accomplished by the application of a resin-sand coating to the surface of the pipe. Laboratory studies of the effect of temperature, corrosive environment, and drilling muds are also covered. Excellent bond strengths are maintained at temperatures up to 350-400 F. Mud films on the external surface of untreated pipe cause poor bonding. Corrosion-inhibition techniques, such as cathodic protection, do not affect the bonding properties of the resin-sand coated pipe.INTRODUCTIONThe problem of poor cement jobs in the oil industry has been one of major concern for many years. Various cement composition1chemical washes preceding the cement slurry2cement additives,3,4and mechanical devices have been used to improve the cementing operation. Higher injection rates to obtain turbulent flow of the cement slurry for better displacement of the mud in the annulus as well as placement of cement around the pipe are also being used. All of these techniques can improve the cement job and should be considered where applicable when cementing casing.With the advent of stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidizing, and the more recent development of secondary-recovery methods such as steam flooding, fire flooding, and miscible flooding, it is especially necessary that the operator get a good primary cement job. Primary-cementing failures that are not at the present time detrimental to his operation can take on major importance when the time comes for secondary-recovery or stimulation techniques to be initiated.Cement failures may never show up during the primary stage of depletion of the reservoir. Only when pressures are exerted on the well as during fracturing, acidizing, or fluid injection of a flooding operation do some of these failures become apparent. Remedial cementing operations, loss of time and effort in performing these operations, contamination of zones as a result of communication, and general well-operating problems can be costly. It is therefore the desire of the operator to obtain the best possible primary cement job in order to avoid these costly operations later. This paper discusses a new technique for treating the external surface of the casing that results in a greatly improved casing-cement bond.Results from our laboratory studies as well as the work of have shown that new, mill-varnished casing gives a very poor casing-cement bond. Roughing the external surface of the casing, as with sandblasting, or even the normal process of rusting improves the bond.",,American Petroleum Institute

It is stretched lengthwise on a special setting tool, which reduces the diameter of the liner until it will pass readily through the well bore. It may then be lowered into place by means of a wire line. There the liner is released from the setting tool, forming a pressure-fit in the casing or open hole and sealing off that particular section so that fluids cannot enter from the well bore. This tool has been successfully used for a number of different well situations since its introduction in 1959; and is a valuable aid during selective acidizing, fracturing, squeeze cementing, waterflooding, and other well-servicing and production operations.

The rubber liner simply and efficiently performs many down-hole functions which previously required more elaborate and costly mechanical packers.Basically, the rubber liner consists simply of a heavy-duty, internally reinforced rubber cylinder, larger in diameter than the pipe or open hole in which it is to be placed. Tension is applied, stretching the rubber cylinder and simultaneously reducing its outside diameter until it will readily enter the bore hole. Once in position, the setting tool is activated, tension is released, and the rubber cylinder springs back into its original form. The resulting width expansion seats the liner firmly against the pipe wall or open hole-as the case may be-forming a tight seal and preventing the entrance of fluid from the well bore into the formation, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The pressure-fit of the expanded liner keeps it securely in place, and any internal differential pressure only serves to provide a tighter seal for covered casing perforations. Surface tests indicate that the rubber liner will withstand approximately 9,000 psi over a 1/2-in. perforation. The rubber liner can serve as a permanent installation, or may be retrieved later on a wire line, as desiredEQUIPMENT&gt;The Rubber LinerThe retrievable liner is made of 5/8-in. thick neoprene rubber (oil-resistant synthetic) reinforced with 4-ply nylon cord. It is made to fit standard casing sizes of 2 &frac12;-in., 4 &frac12;-in., 5 &frac12;-in., and 7 in.; and is available in 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-ft lengths, to fit the requirements of each specific job. Other diameters have been made on special order, for specific applications. The dimensions of the liner are such that they may be used in any casing (from lightweight to that of greatest wall thickness) without modification. The only difference is the amount of stretching the liner requires before placement. Fig. 2 and 3 show a typical liner relaxed and in tension.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lieb(Gulf Oil Corp.),,,,,,API-66-054,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"This paper presents some of the specialized applications of vapor recovery in the Permian Basin that are being utilized to obtain maximum profit. Modifications of conventional installations are discussed for batteries with the following operating conditions:, Batteries in which it is difficult to attain vapor-tight tankage;,batteries with high-gravity oil production;, batteries serving pumping wells with low bottom-hole pressures; and, batteries in which conditions are such as to allow for the successful operation of a jet compressor.INTRODUCTIONThe continuously increasing cost of drilling, completing, and producing oil and gas wells has demanded that producers deliver their oil products to the market as cheaply and efficiently as possible. To obtain maximum efficiency, all salable products must be marketed. Therefore, more and more operators have installed vapor recovery facilities to capture and sell stock-tank vapors that were formerly lost to the atmosphere.One of the problems in the past has been the oversupply of LPG, especially during the summer months. This oversupply resulted in low prices and wide seasonal fluctuations in price. This problem has improved only recently. The increased demand for LPG, especially propane, on a year-round basis and the increased summer use of LPG in flame cultivation, fuel for engines on water-supply wells of irrigation projects, etc. have resulted in higher and more stable prices which in turn have increased the profits of vapor recovery.Since composition of the well stream, separator pressure, and separator temperature are the principle factors that affect the relative amounts of gas and liquid leaving a separator, the economics of each installation must be determined on an individual basis. It will also be necessary to consider provisions of the gas sales contract covering payment for natural gasoline liquids to insure that maximum income is received, depending upon whether the liquids are sold to the crude-oil purchaser or to the gasoline plant. The purpose of this paper is to show some of the different methods of vapor recovery that are being used to obtain maximum profits.CONVENTIONAL VAPOR-RECOVERY INSTALLATIONSVapor-recovery installations in the Permian Basin were becoming commonplace by the late 1950's. Their installation had been accelerated by the practice of lease automatic custody transfer, commingled oil production from two or more pays, and unitized production, which increased the number of wells served by a single battery and thus the stock-tank vapors available at a battery. By far the greatest number of installations are of the conventional type in which vapors are withdrawn from tankage through suction lines by electric motor-driven compressors and boosted to sufficient pressure to enter the gas gathering line. The installations are completely automated and designed to provide for unattended operation under varying load conditions.The types of compressors in use include positive displacement rotary, liquid-seal rotary, and reciprocating compressors. The positive-displacement rotary is more frequently used than the other types. Nearly all the units have electric motors as prime movers and have single-stage, air-cooled compressors. The normal shutdown or bypass controls-such as low-suction pressure, high-discharge pressure, low-lube oil level, high-bearing temperature, etc.-are provided on each installation. The majority of the vapor recovery facilities have been fabricated by the suppliers, although some of the units have been fabricated by the producer.",,American Petroleum Institute

Simpson(Baroid Division National Lead Company .),,,,,,API-66-059,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"Corrosion still plays a major role in drill-pipe failures. Contaminants such as oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, sodium chloride, and carbon dioxide are commonly found in drilling fluids. Recently recognized sources of contamination are thermo-degradation of mud products and inhibited stimulation additives, and these add to the corrosion problem. Physical barriers, such as scale, normally occur inside drill pipe and can result in accelerated corrosion attack. The conditions under which present drilling equipment is used increases the danger of corrosion attack from these contaminants. In recent years, test equipment has been developed and is being used to evaluate corrosion problems and mitigation techniques. Examples of techniques both in the laboratory and the field are given. Case histories of corrosion-inhibitor applications are reported.INTRODUCTIONThe cause and solution of drill-pipe corrosion failure problems have been the subject of investigations for many years. These investigations and practical experience have helped to develop techniques to evaluate and combat drill-pipe failures. The recognition of corrosion problems and development of a corrosion-control program will materially add to the life of drilling equipment.DRILL-PIPE FAILURES AND MITIGATION TECHNIQUESDrill-pipe Failure RecordsIn the development of a corrosion-control program it is helpful to assess the seriousness of the problem from actual failure records. Table 1 shows the various reasons for the loss of 3,478 joints of drill pipe over a 7-year peri0d.lThe results of these data show that corrosion played a major role in 74 percent of the drill-pipe loss. Cracks penetrating the tube wall while drilling accounted for 19 percent of the loss. Most of the cracks were discovered on normal trips out of the hole, but 98 premature trips were made as a result of this type of corrosion failure.It is interesting to note that 80 percent of the tube failures were located within 3ft of the pin or box end of the joint near the upset area.The 74-percent drill-pipe loss attributed to corrosion compares with a 75-percent loss reported from another set of data.? The two areas of operation of the two companies from which the data were drawn are West Texas and the Gulf Coast.Detecting the Cause of CorrosionIf corrosion is a major cause of drill-pipe failure, it is important to be able to detect and assess the causes before failure occurs. The agents that accelerate corrosion in drilling fluids are shown in Table 2. The possible source of these agents and some of the field methods of detection are also listed.Oxygen is perhaps the most common corrosion accelerator found in drilling fluids. Oxygen may be entrained into the drilling fluid through surface pits or intentionally injected into the fluid stream to improve drilling. Oxygen meters have been developed that measure the amount of oxygen in solution. The meters are being used, along with other tests, to study the causes of corrosion attack in active drilling systems. Oxygen scavenger treatments may also be evaluated by the oxygen meter.",,American Petroleum Institute

Frank(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-66-070,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"The presence of even trace amounts of oxygen in waters used for waterflooding can result in excessive corrosion and plugging of the injection formation in some waterfloods. Where source waters contain oxygen, it is usually necessary to provide a means to remove or scavenge the oxygen from the water. Oxygen can be removed mechanically or chemically, depending upon the operator's preference and the economics associated with each project. It was operationally convenient and economically attractive at the Fullerton waterflood to scavenge the oxygen from the water using sulfur dioxide generated by a sulphur burner at the site. This process causes no appreciable change of the pH of the water and is quite adaptable to treatment of large volumes of water under the operating conditions at the Fullerton Unit.INTRODUCTIONSources of water for waterflooding vary widely in the Permian Basin, and normally the water from each source contains undesirable constituents or characteristics. Many of these waters contain oxygen that is native to the producing formation which can result in corrosion and slime or bacterial growth in the waterflood system unless it is removed or neutralized. Free oxygen can be removed by mechanical or chemical means, depending upon the conditions and the economics associated with each situation. It was operationally convenient and economically attractive at the Fullerton Unit to scavenge the oxygen from the flood water using sulfur dioxide generated by a sulfur-burning process described here.DESCRIPTION OF UNIT OPERATIONSThe Fullerton Unit, approximately 16 miles northwest of Andrews, Texas, in Andrews County, consists of 684 wells on 40-acre spacing and produces primarily from the Lower Clearfork at about 7,000 ft. A multiple line-drive-type waterflood was instituted in 1961. However, source-water availability limited injection to only the center row in the North Dome. In 1963 a contract was negotiated which made source flood water available in quantity from a water field in Gaines County, 11 miles to the north. Pumps, surge tanks, filters for the produced water, and the sulfur-burner plant to treat the source flood water are part of the water station located near the center of the North Dome.The Fullerton Unit is now injecting approximately 150,000 B/D of source water and 16,000 B/D of produced water into 122 injection wells. The North Dome injection system uses cement-lined steel pipe and corrosion- resistant accessories since produced water will eventually be injected throughout. In the South Dome, where only source water will be injected, bare lines and standard trim accessories are installed.Water purchased for the Fullerton Unit waterflood is of excellent quality for injection except that it contains approximately 5 ppm oxygen. Unless this oxygen is removed or adequately inhibited, unprotected facilities corrode and the growth of slime-forming bacteria becomes a problem. Even though protective equipment has been used for injection facilities other than the South Dome, removal of the oxygen from the source water was deemed absolutely necessary for several reasons.",,American Petroleum Institute

Boling(National Tank Company),,,,,,API-66-074,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"Understanding the causes and formation of oil-water emulsions and the steps necessary for their resolution is necessary to understand the role of electrostatic coalescence in this process. The formation of emulsions and demulsification is reviewed. The theory of electrostatic coalescence is discussed. The use of this aid in treating oil-field emulsion is shown. Various methods of applying heat to the emulsion are discussed, as are certain practical and economic advantages of the electrostatic coalescer.INTRODUCTIONMost Gulf Coast oil production is associated with salt water sometime during its life. The water is, to some extent at least, emulsified with the oil thus making dehydration of the crude necessary before it is acceptable to the purchaser.Many methods of dehydration have been used in the past. The use of electricity to aid in the dehydration process was known and practiced as early as 1910. This electrical aid gained acceptance, in one form or another, until the advent of the pressure-operated unitized treater in the 1930's. The electrical treater of that time could not compete with this new and simple method of treating except in abnormal problem situations. Changes in producing conditions, practices, market requirements, and economics, along with the widespread availability of electricity in the oil field, have prompted re-introduction of the electrostatic coalescing technique. This technique, and the manner in which it is used with present-day equipment, is considered here.EMULSIONSIn the movement of oil and water between producing formation and the final storage tanks, there exists enough agitation to highly disperse the water throughout the oil. This agitation may be caused by a subsurface pump, gas-lift energy, expansion through a choke, or just the flow through the tubing and flow line. The water forms various-size drops upon agitation, these drops all tending to be spherical in shape. The drops take on this shape because of the attraction existing between the water molecules. This attraction makes the molecules form themselves into the least possible space, which is the sphere. This attraction between water molecules is important, as will be shown later. The water droplets will remain permanently dispersed throughout the oil if they are surrounded by a film. This film prevents them from coming together and forming one large drop and settling downward through the oil strata to the water phase. The surface-active characteristics of this film are increased by a material known as the emulsifying agent. This agent is usually:AsphaltinesResinsHeavy paraffinic and napthenic compoundsFinely dispersed solids1,2,3The emulsifying agents are all composed of compounds with large molecules. These large-molecular compounds form around the water drops, making a thick, tough film. This film is thick enough and tough enough that the molecular attraction between the drops is not strong enough to rupture the film and permit the drops to coalesce. The emulsion is then said to be stable . Destruction of this film, by some form, is necessary before the emulsion can be resolved.A demulsifier chemical is added as the first step in breaking the emulsion. This demulsifier diffuses itself throughout the oil and collects on the surface of the water droplets. It has a stronger tendency to collect on the water-oil interface than does the emulsifying agent. This causes the agent to displace and disperse the original emulsifying agent throughout the oil phase of the mixture. The demulsifier molecules are small, and consequently the",,American Petroleum Institute

This request led to the appointment of a task group. Following this study, which resulted in a favorable report by that group, the new family of connections was designed. An IBM 7090 computer was programmed by Shell Oil Company, and the resulting printout was used to analyze each of the selected connections. Design criteria and formulae used to program the computer are discussed, as well as some of the more sophisticated features of the new connections.INTRODUCTIONAPI Std 7lists 19 rotary connections for use on drill pipe and drill collars. There are 4 different 60-deg V-truncated thread forms spread over the 19 connections. When consideration is given to proprietary connections -such as Acme, American Open Hole, Hughes H-90, Hydril Two-Step, Reed Wide Open - there are over 100 various connections available to the industry.To emphasize the fact that this is not a new problem, the following is quoted from Chapter 20 ofHistory of Petroleum Engineering:1 This committee was organized in 1926 with Capt. J. F. Lucey, founder of the Lucey Manufacturing Corporation, as its first chairman. The situation in rotary tool joints was much the same as in cable tools, i.e., complete confusion; and it was on tapered tool joints that early efforts were concentrated. API standardization soon reduced the number of joints from over 200 to 7. The full-hole type of connection was adopted in 1934, and the internal-flush in 1946. In 1958, the whole range of requirements was spanned by 17 standard connections applicable to swivels, kellys, tool joints, subs, drill collars, and drill bits. Request SubmittedIn December 1961 Asiatic Petroleum Corp., at the request of BIPM, submitted a proposal to the API Committee on Standardization of Rotary Drilling Equipment. The proposal suggested that considerable economy could be realized in the drilling industry by reducing the number of standard connections through standardization of one thread form for use on all necessary diameters. The internal-flush thread was suggested as this form. A list of possible changes was included, showing how the number of standard connections could be reduced to possibly 10 with a single thread form.Task Group AppointedThe Asiatic proposal resulted in the appointment of a task group which was charged with:, investigation of the potential economy of reducing the number of standard connections;, determination of the operational problems which might develop as a result of eliminating any of the connections then in Std 7 ; and, determination of what must be done to provide balanced strength between drill pipe and the recommended rotary shouldered connections.The task group reported that:, substantial economy should result;, no operating problems would result from eliminating some of the connections, provided dimensional specifications remained in print for a period of time; and, the question of tool joint to drill pipe torsional-strength balance should not be considered at that time.",,American Petroleum Institute

Baptist(U.S. Bureau of Mines),,,,,,API-66-092,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"The Bureau of Mines tested cores from 35 wells from 14 producing zones in the tristate area of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky to determine why rates of water injection were apparently low in some zones. Inasmuch as only minor amounts of clay minerals are present in these sandstones, it is concluded that permeability reduction results from the movement of dislodged silica particles and other material, including the clays. Both single-phase and two-phase permeability measurements however, showed that most samples have only low-to-moderate sensitivity to water and that permeability reduction from particle movement is usually not large. The average effective permeability to water was considerably lower than that to oil during the two-phase flow, which is typical of most reservoir rock systems. It can be expected, therefore, that high injection pressures will be required to waterflood thin zones or zones of low permeability.INTRODUCTIONThe Independent Petroleum Association of America asked the Bureau of Mines to study the cause of apparent low rates of water injection experienced by some operators in the tristate area. Water damage was suspected as causing the low injection rates and high injection pressures experienced in some fields. The study was assigned to personnel of the Laramie Petroleum Research Center because of their experience in investigating the basic cause of water sensitivity in many reservoirs. Flow behavior, saturation characteristics, and clay-mineral content of productive sandstones in the tristate area were analyzed, and formation damage attributable to water sensitivity was inferred from these results.Formation damage resulting from mud-filtrate (water) invasion into the face of the formation or from water injected for secondary recovery of oil has long been recognized as an important factor in well performance. Mud-filtrate invasion during drilling may seriously reduce the flow of oil to the well bore. Water damage during waterflooding may completely plug a well, or to some lesser extent limit the amount of water that can be injected at an acceptable pressure.Sandstones that are subject to damage because of reaction between the invading water and the interstitial materials that line the rock pores are called water-sensitive . The primary causes of sensitivity are believed to be the dispersion and rearrangement of clay-mineral particles or the transportation of other unstable interstitial material to form flow restrictions.All types of clay minerals disperse, but this effect is most pronounced with montmorillonites because of their swelling properties. Illites, kaolinites, and chlorites, which are often found in petroleum reservoir rocks, disperse to a lesser degree. Clay dispersion can be described as follows: In the undisturbed reservoir the clays and other interstitial material are in equilibrium with the formation water, and are flocculated. When incompatible water-fresh water in particular-invades the formation, cations attached to clay particles arc removed so that the clays become unstable and disperse.1Atwood' describes the manner in which the clay particles reorient themselves to form flow constrictions as the brush heap effect. Clay particles that are saturated with monovalent sodium ions are much less stable in the presence of fresh water than clays having adsorbed divalent calcium or magnesium ions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Rollins(Drilco Oil Tools Inc.),,,,,,API-66-100,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"In the last three years three new tool assemblies have demonstrated ability to direct the course of the bit while drilling ahead in full-sized hole. These tools have been used in a variety of situations in which hole angle has been held at a desired maximum angle, hole angle has been reduced, hole angle has been increased, or hole direction has been changed at the control of the operator from the surface. This paper describes the three tool assemblies and illustrates typical results obtained with each.INTRODUCTIONsince the rotary drilling has been used, drillers have wished for a method to force the bit laterally toward a desired objective while drilling ahead in full-sized hole. In the last three years, three new tool assemblies have become to accomplish this result. For the first time it is possible to control from the surface a positive force on the bit continuously applied in a desired direction while drilling ahead in a full-sized hole.Historically, lateral deflection of the well bore has been accomplished by placing a wedge or whipstock in the well bore in an oriented manner. When a bit is rotated as it advances down the face of the wedge, it is forced out of the well bore into the formation beginning a new hole in a new direction. Usually this new hole is begun with a small bit and subsequently reamed out to full size. Because the whipstock exerts a force on the bit only while the bit is in contact with it, directional control is lost once the bit is fully engaged in the new formation. In order to gain additional angle change, the whipstock procedure must be repeatedly applied. In medium-to-hard formation areas, with dipping formations, the tendency of the bit to continuously change angle until it is drilling perpendicular to the formation dip means that many whipstocks must be set if the bit is to be forced along a course ~n some other direction. Difficulty is experienced in holding the whipstock in a desired orientation m hard formations since the whipstock cannot be securely anchored. In softer-formation areas, whipstocks are notably more successful because they can bury into the formations and maintain orientation, and because it is somewhat easier to maintain an established course in the new hole in softer formation. Another successful means of starting a hole in a new direction in soft formations is by fluid of the of the hole. gy1is is accomplished by orienting a single large nozzle on the bit to a desired direction and raising and lowering the bit without rotation. This jetting action enlarges the hole on that side, and permits the bit to move laterally in that direction. By repeatedly moving the bit to bottom, the driller can erode the formation and advance the hole without rotating the bit. Again the force directed is limited in duration, and control is somewhat less positive than with the whipstock. The application of the jetting technique is limited extremely soft formations such as those found in South Louisiana.Some control of direction and of hole angle can be achieved by use of stabilizers and reamers strategically placed in the drill string to exert a lateral force on the bit either to increase or decrease hole angle. The limitation here is that the force applied is small, dependent upon the lateral effect of gravity on drill collars in an inclined hole. This technique is useful primarily in Increasing or decreasing vertical angle, but is not well adapted to changing hole direction.",,American Petroleum Institute

National Lead Company),,,,,,API-66-109,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"This paper reviews the principles of penetration rate as affected by the drilling fluid. A minimum-solids fluid produces fastest penetration rate. With such a fluid, hole troubles may be severe. Extra precautions need to be taken with respect to hydraulics and properties of the circulating system to maintain hole stability. These are discussed in detail, \\it11 examples, in an assigned drilling operation. A simplified method of evaluating shape of flow profile and determining type of flow in annuli is presented.INTRODUCTIONDrilling mud is a drilling tool just as are pumps, drill pipe, collars, and bits; and, just like any other piece of equipment, may be used to help or harm the operation. Mud must be made to work with the overall operation, not against it. Too often mud properties are controlled willy-nilly for the sake of economy or expediency. The science of mud treatment is such that mud properties may be controlled to meet any demands. One requisite is that mud should control formation pressure. This restriction decides only one property density. Viscosity, gel strength, and filtration control may be necessary in some cases; but it is known that air, gas, or water alonecanin many cases, perform the functions of carrying cuttings to the surface, cleaning the bit, and maintaining a stable hole.1The science of mud engineering is not yet able to predict with certainty what flow characteristics and properties will be required in a particular situation. The science is able to look with intelligence at what hydraulic conditions exist and what the problems are so that changes of the flow characteristics and hydraulics can be made to relieve the problems.PENETRATION RATEPenetration rate is greatly influenced by the solid content of the mud2-7 incland by the total pressure of the mud on bottom.5,8,9Recent investigations have shown that 4 P I filtrate, oil content, viscosity, gel strength, circulating rate, etc. cannot be used to predict penetration rate. These other properties frequently produce effects on solid content and circulating pressure that do result in changed penetration rate. A moment's reflection will show examples of muds with bad-for-drilling viscosity or filtrate that drill faster than good-for-drilling properties. The high-viscosity mud, handled in such a way as to give low pressure on bottom and minimum solids, may drill faster than a poorly handled low-viscosity mud that gives higher pressure and sold content. Density has purposely been left out of the foregoing discussion. As mentioned in the introduction, density must be adjusted to control pressure in the formation. Thus in weighted muds pressure on bottom and solid content are both working against penetration rate. It is assumed that good mud engineering practice will strive for minimum mud weight for the sake of material economy alone. In this case economy works for best penetration. Too often, in the medium-weight ranges or where natural mud weights of 9 5 to 10.5 ppg occur spontaneously, insufficient engineering effort is directed to finding and maintaining a minimum safe density and minimum solid content.",,American Petroleum Institute

In this major engineering development, three general types of rigs-submersible, jackup, and floating-have evolved. The important steps in the development of each type of rig are discussed. The major mishaps experienced by these rigs are also tabulated. It is predicted that, in 5 years, there will be approximately 200 mobile units in operation. Technology will be available to drill exploratory wells in 3,000 ft of water and to produce wells in 1,000 ft of water.INTRODUCTIONDuring the past 20 years, we have witnessed a spectacular growth in world-wide offshore drilling operations. one of the key factors in this growth has been the offshore mobile unit. In 1949, there was 1 mobile unit capable of drilling in 20 ft of water. By the end of 1966, there will be 150 mobile units valued at approximately $600 million. A number of these units will be able to drill exploratory wells in 1,000 ft of water. A magazine article once referred to offshore mobile units as a strange armada. This is certainly an apt description of the many unusual designs which have been developed to solve a variety of problems. In fact, this development is one of the important engineering achievements of this century, and it was financed by the petroleum industry and the contractors which serve our industry. Therefore, this is an appropriate time to review how these units have evolved and make some predictions about the future course of this development.he definition of an offshore mobile unit which will be used in this paper is any portable unit containing a drilling rig capable of drilling in open water 20 ft or deeper. This definition includes tender-type mobile platforms and special mobile workover rigs. It excludes the inland or posted drilling barges, drilling-rig tenders, and fixed platforms. Within this definition, the first offshore mobile unit was the Barnsdall-Hayward Breton Rig 20, which became operational in 1949. John T. Hayward, the designer of this rig, is truly the father of the offshore mobile unit, and his basic design principles - lower cost for wildcatting, portability, transparency to wave action, and negligible change in buoyancy with change in surrounding water level - have governed the design of these units to the present day.in the course of the research for this paper, the following information was gathered on each unit: operational date, nominal water depth, type of unit, and its dimensions.

Dwyer(Standard Oil Co. of Texas),,,,,,API-66-144,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"Production cost control is a matter of growing concern to the industry. Even with much effort toward reduction, producing costs continue to rise. The reason for this lies in the fact that effective cost control is first a people, and then an operational problem. People must be moved to want to reduce costs before they will reduce them. A planned and properly presented cost control program will open closed minds. It will answer the prime rebuttal of How do you know my costs are high? . Above all, it will dispel the universal excuse given for high cost, My costs are different. Such a program was initiated within Standard Oil Company of Texas in early 1964. From its inception, the plan was to motivate people by arousing their competitive instincts. The procedures followed in the system, although of a mechanical and accounting nature, fall together in such a way as to stimulate people's desire to never be last , to do as well or better than others . From results of this program, it is seen that the tools to control cost are available. Tools alone, however, can build nothing-they must be used by people- in this case by line management.INTRODUCTIONThe cost-control procedures to be discussed were developed in the Western Division of Standard Oil Company of Texas, which is a subsidiary of Standard Oil Company of California. The Western Division operates approximately 2,400 wells, located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeast New Mexico. Production ranges from 1,300 ft pumping to 16,000 ft flowing oil and gas. Operated oil and gas equivalent production was 79,000 BOPD in 1965, and will be 93,000 BOPD in 1966.In early 1961 the cost-control system now used in the Western Division of Sotex was visualized. It could not be implemented, however, because the records necessary for control were not available. During the last 4 years this production cost-control system was developed and sold to operating people, with the result that the steady 10 percent per year increase in field controllable costs as been arrested. Only now the results of efforts initiated in 1961 are being realized. There has been no decrease in production as a result of the program. On the contrary, the Division's production increased 5,000 BOPD in 1 year. With optimum producing expense as its eventual objective, the program's ultimate goal is maximum profits at all times. Success is attributable to direct and active support by Division and District management.The system identifies areas of abnormal cost by comparing actual costs with forecast goals based on guiding standards. Comparison of actual costs vs. guides identifies the particular fields in which costs are above the forecast, tells why, and does so in time to allow corrective action.RESULTSFor quite some time, the Western Division's field controllable costs had increased 9 to 10 percent each year, or approximately $500,000 per year. There had been a corresponding increase in production and, for this reason, the cost increase was not questioned.",,American Petroleum Institute

The initial water injection began in January, 1961 and 15.8 MMbbl have been injected in 5 years. Waterflood recovery through December, 1965 is 3.2 MMbbl of oil and 306 Mbbl of water. This represents 48 percent of the ultimate primary oil recovery. Overall performance of the reservoir is given, as well as performance of the 9-spot pattern. It includes production comparison in both offset and corner wells along with fill up progress and water-oil ratios.INTRODUCTIONThe Northeast Purdy Springer B unit is located in south-central Oklahoma in Garvin County, approximately 10 miles southeast of Lindsay (Fig. 1). The unit includes 64 wells on 40-acre spacing covering an area of 4 square miles.It was unitized December 1, 1959 along with 2 other units-the Springer A and Hart Sand units. These units are operated from one office located in Lindsay with Cities Service Oil Company as operator. The Hart reservoir overlies the northeast half of the Springer B which resulted in 30 dually completed wells. This became an important factor in waterflood planning. These Hart sands are present approximately 900 ft above the Springer formation.FIELD DATAThe major portion of the field was drilled in 1954 and 1955 and thoughts toward secondary recovery and unitization occurred by the time the first log was run.The Springer structure is shown by Fig. 2. The formation dips about 8 deg to the west and well depths vary from 8,800 to 10,000 ft east to west and the average depth is about 9,500 ft (-8,400 subsea). This reservoir is enclosed by an errosional truncation on the east, by permeability pinch-out on the north and south, and by an oil-water contact on the west. The aquifer of this reservoir is inactive.Net sand thicknesses as determined from micro-logs and core data are shown by Fig. 3. Thicknesses vary up to 48 ft and the average is 34 ft per well. A typical electric log of the sand body is shown in Fig. 4. It is a fairly clear sand with good oil saturation. Reservoir Fluid and Sand Characteristics Reservoir fluid and sand characteristics are shown in Table 1, Table 2, and Fig. 4A.PRIMARY OILThe primary oil-producing energy was from solution gas drive which was relatively inefficient. Only 11 percent of the oil in place was recoverable by this method.(Fig.1 is available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Madrazo(Continental Oil Company),,,,,,API-66-175,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"This paper presents the methods of analysis used and the remedial procedures applied to sucker-rod pumping problems encountered at the South Glenrock Block B Unit (SGBU). Methods of reducing down-hole friction and combating increased sucker-rod loading, and the results of the application of recommended remedial procedures, are presented. The program to reduce rod-string failures and maintain production at increased levels was successful. Most of the procedures used are not new; however, the scope and combinations of analyses and procedures necessary to reduce rod-string failures may have application elsewhere.INTRODUCTIONThe South Glenrock Field is located approximately 25 miles east of Casper, Wyoming, on the southwest edge of the Powder River Basin (Fig. 1). The field was discovered in July, 1950. Production is from the Upper Muddy, Lower Muddy, and Dakota formations of Lower Cretaceous age. Full-scale waterflood operations were started in 1962 when production had declined to 4,200 BLPD. The present production rate is approximately 17,300 BLPD (8,850 BOPD, 8,450 BWPD, 100 GOR). The gross production rate vs. time curve is illustrated in Fig. 2 (A).The producing depth ranges from 5,700 ft to 7,450 ft. The majority of the 193 wells at SGBU are completed with 5 1/2-in. casing, perforated in the Upper and Lower Muddy zones with the Dakota being produced either through perforations or from open hole. The majority of original production equipment consisted of 2 3/8 -in. OD EUE tubing, 3/4-5/8-in. rods, insert pumps and pumping units with peak torque ratings of either 160,000 or 228,000 in.-lb. Some tubing strings were equipped with hydraulic-type hold-downs. The bottom-hole temperature is approximately 145 F.Response to waterflooding has resulted in withdrawals increasing from an average rate per well of 34 BLPD in 1962 to 138 BLPD in 1965. The average production from wells with large down-hole equipment and large pumping units ranges between 300 and 650 BLPD. An attempt to increase production with the existing surface and subsurface equipment was not successful. Increasing the stroke length and the speed of existing pumping units resulted in increased sucker-rod loading and failure of the old rod strings. The old rod strings were then replaced with new 3/4-7/8-in. rods equipped with 7/8-in. slim-hole couplings to provide clearance in the 2 3/8-in. OD EUE tubing. Rod failures continued, most of the breaks occurring in the 7/8-in. slim-hole couplings. The installation of tension-type anchor catchers in the 23/8-in. tubing strings, subsequent to rod-string replacement, reduced the 7/8-in. slim-hole coupling breaks in a few wells, but was not completely effective. The additional production desired could not be obtained with the existing equipment and the installation of larger equipment followed. Two and seven-eighth- inch OD tubing, 1-7/8-3/4-in. rods (with stress ratings of 40,000 psi) with oversize 3/4-7/8-in. couplings and 1-in. slim-hole couplings, and larger pumping units with peak torque ratings of 320,000, 456,000 and 640,000 in.-lb were then installed. Rod failures were reduced somewhat but continued at a high rate, occurring in the 1-in. slim-hole couplings. The need for a detailed study of the problem was evident, because breaks occurred in all rod strings regardless of the size or make of pumping unit or bottom-hole equipment.",,American Petroleum Institute

Peters(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-66-186,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1966,"br/&gt;Temperature surveys offer a quick, economic means of diagnosing trouble in wells or solving well-completion and operation problems. Fast-response thermometers are now available in both subsurface-recording and surface-recording types. These thermometers can measure temperature anomalies of as little as 1 F, or less. In addition to conventional uses of temperature surveys (locating cement top, leaks), the fast-response thermometers offer a way to evaluate results of hydraulic fracturing and to locate zones actually taking fluids, whereas flowmeters show only the point of exit of injected fluids. To evaluate fractures, hot or cold fluid is injected to create a thermal anomaly. A temperature profile then delineates the fractured zone.INTRODUCTIONSince the 1930's, when subsurface measuring and recording instruments were first developed, subsurface recording thermometers have proved that temperature surveys in wells are direct, economical, and sometimes the only practical means of solving several types of drilling and completion problems.1,2Also, surface recording thermometers have proved to be very successful for many purpose1,3Temperature surveys are now commonly used for:Location of cement freshly placed outside the casing.Location of tubing and casing leaks.Location of excessive gas entry in oil wells.Location of zones receiving fluids in injection wells..Location of unwanted flow outside casing.In recent years, the location of zones receiving fluids in injection wells has increased in importance as more extensive use of secondary, and even tertiary, recovery methods is made. Also, experience has shown that temperature surveys can be used to determine location of hydraulic fractures - and possibly the orientation of fractures.Extensive experience with routine temperature surveys as a means of early detection of possibly dangerous well conditions has shown that highly sensitive thermometers can head off trouble. For example, recent calculations have shown that small oil leaks-of about 30 to 40 bbl per day--can cause a thermal anomaly of about 1 F.Two commonly used subsurface thermometers, the Amerada and the Humble type, can detect anomalies this small. Consequently, close attention to survey charts made in routine reconnaissance runs can result in early detection of leaks. A subsequent diagnostic run can pin-point the trouble. In many cases, detailed runs can lead to correct diagnosis of the trouble and indicate corrective action.The purpose of this paper is to show examples of the use of sensitive, rapid-response thermometers in diagnosing wells. Examples will also be given of more common uses of subsurface-recording thermometers.RAPID-RESPONSE THERMOMETERSTwo subsurface-recording thermometers available to the industry are the Amerada and Humble types. The Amerada thermometer consists of a bulb sealed to a helical Bourdon tube. The bulb and tube both contain a volatile fluid. Changes in the vapor pressure are a measure of changes in temperature. The improved Humble-type thermometer consists essentially of a mercury-filled cylinder equipped with a piston operating through a packing box. Changes in extension of the piston are caused by changes of the mercury volume, which are a measure of the changes in well temperature.",,American Petroleum Institute

Processes covered ' include gravity separation, flotation, filtration, and dissolved-gas removal.Factors which must be considered in equipment choice and/or design are enumerated. Emphasis is placed on materials of construction and simplicity of operation.I. POSSIBLE MEANS OF DISPOSALbr/&gt;The oil operator has only a limited choice in deciding what to do about waste water and the nature of the effluent has a decided bearing on the problem. The choice is limited in specific instances. Following are possible means of disposing of waste water:Percolation into ground water tableDischarge to streams or lakesDischarge to the oceanDischarge to storm sewerDischarge to sanitary sewerEvaporationUse as industrial waterUse as domestic waterUse as input to chemical plantUse for waterfloodingSubsurface injection into brackish or saline water zones.II. TREATMENT PROCESSESThis paper covers the treatment processes which must be considered in preparing a water for disposal. Some of the treatment processes are common to all methods of disposal, whereas others are peculiar to one or more disposal methods.The major treatment processes, which may be required to process the water for disposal or reuse, are as follows:Oil removalGas removalSolids removalReduction in biochemical and chemical oxygen demandAll other treatment processes are subsidiary to these main processes.A. Oil RemovalOil removal is basic to all disposal processes involving oil-field water, although the necessary completeness of oil removal may vary widely. There is an economic point or dividing line on each lease where oil removal for the value of the oil recovered ceases to be profitable. Our discussions begin at this point, as we are concerned with the treatment of waste water, not oil recovery.The ease of removing oil from water is greatly influenced by chemical treatment or the physical handling of the oil-water mixture before it reaches the wastewater system. Frequently, the operator may make a minor change in the chemical treatment or the physical handling of the oil-water mixture before it reaches the waste-water facility. This change may result in a considerable increase in the cost of operating the waste water.The treatment and handling of oil and water from the point where they leave the formation to the ultimate discharge of the water from the lease must be viewed a s a n integrated process. All changes, whether mechanical or chemical, must be reviewed for their total effect on the system, not just the immediate problem a t hand. A few examples will suffice to illustrate the point:Overtreatment of producing wells with certain types of scale inhibitors will stabilize the dispersion of oil in water, making oil removal in the waste-water system more difficult.",,American Petroleum Institute

In an effort to create a better understanding, an analysis of borehole enlargement was made and is presented here.Many factors have a bearing on borehole stability Discussions of such factors as dog-leg seventy, deviation, hole cleaning, etc have been purposely limited to their influence on borehole stabilityTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONSBefore analyzing borehole enlargement experienced on the test program well, a review of the various theoretical considerations is in order Two terms will be used to describe hole enlargement - erosion and sloughing Erosion is used to describe mechanical wearing away of rock Very fine grain sized particles are visualized as being introduced into the hole Sloughing is used to describe falling or spalling away of previously fractured rock Sloughed particles can range widely in size from cuttings to boulders Many factors contribute to erosion, fracturing, and resultant sloughing or spalling away of rock.Drill-pipe and Drill-collar Erosion and SloughingErosion (wearing away) of borehole wall caused by drill pipe and drill collars occurs in doglegs and inclined sections of the hole Of these two, dogleg severity can result In considerably greater thrust forces being imposed on the borehole wall, because such forces are a function of the change in angle between successive drill-string- borehole wall contact points (usually at tool joints) and the tension in the drill string at that depth. It is most critical in the top part of the hole where drill-pipe tension is highest, hole exposure time longest, and the total number of drill-string revolutions and trips is largestForces imposed on a borehole wall by drill pipe in uniformly inclined hole are much smaller than those In doglegs They are a function of the hole angle and the weight of only that portion of the drill string between points of supportAs a comparison, the wall thrust force imposed by 6,000 ft of 4 1/2-in drill pipe (100,000 Ib tension) hanging in a dogleg of 1/2 deg/100 ft is the same as that of 4 1/2-in drill pipe in a uniformly inclined 30-deg hole It is difficult to consistently maintain dogleg severity less than 1/2 deg/100 ft in dipping formations, even with good deviation-control measures When dogleg-seventy control is not used, severe doglegs (2 deg+ /100 ft) are common and the resulting key seats represent one of the major forms of borehole enlargement Deviation is rarely permitted to reach 30 deg and, because of target area requirements, is generally considerably less The total number of drill-pipe rotations is also a factor in hole erosion.",,American Petroleum Institute

However, in many instances cathodic protection has not been applied and controlled properly As a result, unprotected foreign metallic structures have been damaged by accelerated corrosion attack caused by stray currents or interference from these installations. Of the many stray current interference problems which are encountered, interference with well casings is probably the most difficult and expensive to detect this is because these structures are not accessible for normal corrosion measurements Consequently, several casing leaks may occur before the operator becomes aware that a problem exists The purpose of this paper is to describe the equipment and methods used by Sinclair to detect and remedy interference with well casings.HOW INTERFERENCE WORKSThe best way of describing how interference current affects well casings IS to briefly review the mechanism of external casing corrosion. As shown in Fig 1, external casing corrosion is caused by a flow of electric current between different areas on the casing surface The current flows as a result of a potential difference between these areas There are several reasons why potential differences exist, but regardless of the reason, positive current leaves the casing at high potential areas called anodes It flows through the earth and re-enters the casing at lower potentla1 areas called cathodes The casing wall completes the circuit or corrosion cell Anodes and cathodes may be separated by several thousand feet or they may be only a fraction of an inch apartCorrosion occurs at the anodes because the current leaves the casing as iron ions Cathodes are protected by the re-entry of current, hence the concept of cathodic protection However, in cathodic protection, direct current from an outside source is utilized to make the entire casing string a cathode Since no current leaves the casing except through an external metal conductor, no corrosion occurs (Fig 2)In any cathodic protection installation, the flow of protective current is not confined entirely to the earth which lies between the anode ground bed and the protected structure Instead, as shown in Fig 3, it flows out symmetrically from the anode and sometimes travels great distances before arriving at the protected structure from all directions. If a foreign metallic structure such as a well casing is located in this current field, it acts as a parallel conductor with the earth and helps transport the current to its intended destination. As in a normal corrosion cell, the casing is protected where the current gets on the pipe, but where it is discharged back to earth, corrosion occurs In other words, cathodic protection interference results from current following the path of least resistance",,American Petroleum Institute

McLelland(Esso Production Research Co.),,,,,,API-67-040,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1967,"A study of the frictional flow characteristics of gas in plastic-coated tubing indicates an approximate 25- percent increase in transmissibility resulting from the low frictional characteristics of new plastic-coated tubing, as compared to conventional plain tubing. This advantage is quickly reduced or lost with sand productionINTRODUCTIONA great deal of plastic-coated tubing and tubingless casing was run In Humble's South Texas gas fields, primarily as a means of providing corrosion protection Field experience, in the form of gas-well open-flow potentia1 tests, initially indicated a secondary benefit of lower frictional loss in the plastic-coated tubing and casing strings. The following study was made in an attempt to determine to what degree gas transmissibility was affected by the plastic-coated tubing.DEFINITION OF TRANSRIISSION FACTORThe transmission factor of any tubular goods may be defined as a proportionality constant relating flow rate and frictional pressure drop. It is numerically equivalent to the square root of the reciprocal of the friction factor,f.(The formula is available in full paper)The derivation of the vertical gas-flow equation relating frictional pressure loss to a transmission factor is given in Appendix 1.The transmission factor is thereby a means of numerically evaluating the ability of a given pipe to transmit gas. The higher the transmission factor, the lower the frictional pressure drop and, consequently, the easier a gas flows through a pipe. Pipe with a transmission factor of 20 can transmit twice as much gas as the same size pipe with a transmission factor of 10 for any given pressure drop. This may he illustrated use of Equation (Al-4) in Appendix 1.TEST PROCEDUREThe data utilized in this study were obtained from transmissibility tests Appendix 2 outlines the data required and the test procedure for such a testThis test is basically a Texas Railroad Commission four-point open-flow potential test with a pressure bomb In the hole to record flowing bottom-hole pressures. The data required to calculate the transmission factor from such a test are., flowing bottom-hole and wellhead pressures and temperatures,, full well stream flow rate and gravity,, ID of the tubing, and, free water production rate, if anyIt is extremely important that these data be gathered with care since the transmissibility of the pipe is very sensitive to such things as gas gravity. For Instance, a change from 0 65 to 0 67 in gravity would have changed the apparent transmission factor from 16 0 to 16 8 in an 8,000-ft well flowing at 10 MMcf/D through 2 1/2-in ID tubing or casing. This sensitivity is the result of the difference term in the numerator under the square root radical in Equation (Al-4), Appendix 1 The magnitude of the error in transmissibility created by errors in gas gravity or flowing pressures is excessive at low flow rates or low gas velocities and smaller at higher rates For this reason, it is desirable to perform such tests on high-productivity wells.It is possible to perform transmissibility tests and obtain completely erroneous or impossible values for transmission factors This is due to either inaccurate test data or bad test conditions. Inaccurate data will most likely be bottom-hole pressures, wellhead temperatures, or full well stream gas gravity. It is usually necessary to calculate full well stream gravity based on separator off-gas gravity and gas-liquid ratios. This correlation is by no means exact It is also necessary to obtain full well stream gas critical properties to determine compressibility",,American Petroleum Institute

Humble Oil Refining Company and Brown oil Tools have jointly built a workover and service rig which utilizes thin-walled 3/4-in OD continuous steel tubing as the work string The rig is unitized for unloading with offshore production-platform cranes. Initial field usage has shown the rig capable of most concentric rig operations currently conducted with jointed pipe The continuous string makes some operations more versatile than current concentric operations with jointed pipe, and time savings are indicated with the coiled-tubing techniques Other advantages include smaller crews, improved safety, ability to work on live wells, and the clearance advantages of pipe without couplings More utility and an expansion of application appears possible with additional testing and development.INTRODUCTIONThe idea of uncoiling pipe or a flexible conduit into an oil well for drilling, workover, or servicing operations has intrigued the oil industry for over 30 years1,2Several ingenious ideas have been formulated3,4,5that have waited for materials, techniques, or sufficient demand to make the ideas economically attractive in the last 10 years, several units have been built that use the spooled-conduit principle for drilling operations on a limited depth basis6,7,8,9In addition, completions have been made with smaller and smaller casing as Ideas have evolved into workable tools10Multiple completions and tubingless completions11led to big advancements in through-tubing techniques for workover and well servicing12,13The appeal of a continuous coiled-tubing system for these operations is apparent in the additional new ideas generated14,15,16and the construction of one unit to perform concentric string operations17Incentive for Successful DevelopmentA decrease in the time spent on pipe trips is one of the key advantages attributed to a coiled-tubing system This advantage is realized through the elimination of numerous connections, but the side advantages of a continuous string may outweigh the direct economy of reduced trip time Each connection made in pipe is a potential leak, and the care and expense of connections is a large part of the cost of conventional concentric systemsThe size of a workover-unit crew or a drilling-rig crew is determined by the number of men required to trip the pipe. If pipe is continuous and on a reel, it is possible to economically automate the tripping operations and reduce crew size from 4 or 5 men to as few as 2 menWell and personnel safety is inherently better with a continuous tube because the inside of the pipe string is not left open to the atmosphere at each connection The pipe can always be connected to the circulating system, which is ready to circulate the well at any time The well can be continuously circulated while tripping pipe, if desired, and wet strings are eliminated. The continuous tubing makes it possible to work on live wells without the time and expense of a snubbing operation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Of California),,,,,,API-67-066,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1967,"Urban drilling in the city of Los Angeles entered a new era several years ago, when legislation was passed permitting drilling of temporary geological exploratory core holes. Today an oil-producing company can economically drill one or more such holes to determine the potential of a proposed oil-drilling operation. With data collected from these exploratory core holes, the operator can engineer an optimum development program with the most economical selection of drill sites and drilling, production, and pressure-maintenance facilities. This paper describes how this new concept in urban drilling has been utilized by the producing department of Standard Oil Co. of California, Western Operations, Inc., in the design and construction of its new Packard urban drill site on Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles. This site incorporates a unique soundproofed drilling enclosure in which two conventional portable-mast-type electric-powered drilling rigs can drill 64 wells, a production-pit area including oil-gathering, gaging, gas separation, and water-cleaning facilities, as well as a machinery building with artificial-lift, pressure-maintenance, and associated supporting facilities.INTRODUCTIONIn April 1966, news media carried an article relating how Standard Oil Co. of California was preparing to build an unusual drilling structure to house two electric powered drilling rigs for drilling 64 wells on a new drill site in West Los Angeles. The press release indicated how it was planned to use this new concept to develop a field that had been discovered through core-hole drilling. This type of drilling, which has been permitted under strict control in the city of Los Angeles since 1963, allows drilling an exploratory well for the purpose of obtaining core and sidewall samples and running electric logs to determine subsurface geological and stratigraphical information. A permit for this type of well can normally be obtained in 4 to 6 weeks and a typical core hole drilled to 6,000 ft. costs in the order of $75,000 to $100,000. Fig. 1 shows a recent typical core hole being drilled on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. As with this well, most core holes must be drilled-with partially soundproofed equipment, drilling operations are limited to 7 :30 A:M. to 9 :00 P.M., and no drilling is permitted on Sundays or holidays.Prior to adoption of the legislation permitting the present type of core hole, exploratory wells in an urbanized area of the city had to be drilled into an approved oil-drilling district from a controlled drill site. Obtaining permission to drill under such conditions was not only time-consuming - often requiring a year or more, (The Fig. 1 is available in full paper) but also was very expensive with a typical exploratory well costing in the range of $300,000 to $600,000.1These wells were normally drilled using an electric-powered rig with a soundproofed standard derrick. In order to minimize initial capital expenditures, the oil operator would often drill the first well using an expandable type of cellar, a construction-type wooden fence around the site, and other minimum initial cost facilities. If the exploratory well proved up an economical drilling program, the cellar was expanded, permanent block walls with landscaping, and production-handling facilities were added.",,American Petroleum Institute

Throughout the Mid-Continent region, usage and Variation of the components of the bottom-hole assemblies have resulted in well-bore deviations being maintained within desired limits, greater penetration rates, and longer bit life.INTRODUCTIONIn the central and southern portions of the Mid- Continent region, perhaps the most critical drilling problem encountered is that of crooked hole Numerous techniques have been used in an effort to overcome the crooked-hole problem. These techniques include the use of conventional reamers and stabilizers to form a semi-packed hole assembly and/or application of the pendulum technique The semi-packed hole assembly has been successful to the degree of controlling hole deviation within the desired limits However, penetration rate has suffered as a result of the reduced bit loading required for deviation control The semi-packed hole assembly is also conducive to forming severe dog-legs In formations having steep dips, cross faults, and beds of variable drillability.A more recent approach to the problem of crooked-hole drilling is the use of the full-packed hole assemblies These assemblies are composed of square sections, machined to 1/10-in of nominal hole-size diameter, viz, the square drill collar and supporting tools.Through the use of full-packed hole assemblies, it has been possible to obtain near-optimum penetration rates with a minimum rate of change in hole angle and/or dog-legsFor the purpose of clarity, it is prudent to define the intended meaning of three terms used repeatedly In this paperSemi-packed Bottom-hole Assembly Refers to a configuration of tools with a relatively low degree of rigidity and wall-bearing surfacesPacked Bottom-hole Assembly Refers to a configuration of tools with relatively an intermediate degree of rigidity and wall-bearing surfacesFull-packed Bottom-hole Assembly Refers to a configuration of tools with relatively a high degree of rigidity and wall-bearing surfacesIn the northern portion of the Mid-Continent region, crooked hole is not a severe problem Bedding planes are generally approaching the horizontal with folding and faulting at a minimum Except in isolated situations generally speaking, drilling problems are reduced to making hole at a faster rateThe most recent approach to increasing penetration rate, where near-optimum bit loading can consistently be applied, has been through the use of a bit-stabilization programNumerous configurations of the semi-packed and packed bottom-hole assemblies are applicable to bit stabilization One of the more adaptable configurations uses the integral-blade stabilizer immediately above the bit with string integral-blade stabilizer section spaced 15 and 45 ft up the string A second configuration is the Circle C stabilizer assembly.Results from bit-stabilization programs conducted in the northern portions of the Mid-Continent region indicate a considerable increase in penetration rate and bit lifeThis paper will present comparative data and results obtained from packed and full-packed hole assemblies used in drilling the crooked-hole areas, and results of bit-stabilization",,American Petroleum Institute

Substantial improvements in hardware and techniques have been made, yet the rotary-drilling process remains substantially unchanged since its introduction in the Spindletop Field at the dawn of this century A good deal of study has been devoted to various aspects of the drilling problem and much has been learned Still, realistic analytical treatment of drilling at depth remains to be accomplished, partly because there are so many factors involved and because valid simulation of actual subsurface conditions is extremely difficultResearch into the drilling problem has ranged from an applied to a very basic approach Thus, one may experiment directly to develop improved equipment and/or techniques which result in decreased drilling footage costs Such a rig-floor approach has, in many cases, produced very substantial gains On the other hand, one may argue that significant improvements in the drilling process could perhaps be forth coming if the process were fully understood That is, changes in current equipment and/or practices should be based upon a basic understanding of the complex and interrelated short-tell events which occur at and near the bit during drillingSuch a basic approach - the nature of rock and itsbehavior under simulated down-hole conditions - was the underlying philosophy by which, in 1959, Dr Carl Gatlin initiated a drilling and rock-mechanics research program in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at the University of Texas A portion of the work was supported by an API Grant-in-aid during 1960, and in 1961 the research program achieved project status (API Project 67E) During the past 3 years the program has been expanded, and today 12 interrelated drilling and rock-mechanics projects are wholly or substantially supported under API Project 67EA basic research program is usually a long-term, expensive process Basic research related to drilling is indeed time-consuming and costly.",,American Petroleum Institute

Crosby(Long Beach Oil Development Co.),,,,,,API-67-181,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1967,"Two years of experience with hydraulic power-water systems has indicated operating costs of these systems is significantly higher than other comparable lifting methods. Two major reasons for this are abnormal power-water losses and high-solids content of the circulating power water. These problems are being dealt with; and, in the near future, it is expected that costs can be substantially reduced.INTRODUCTIONIn 1964 Long Beach Oil Development Company, as operator for the City of Long Beach under a 25-year contract, opened a new parcel of the Wilmington Field to develop non-unit production. Producing by means of a hydraulic power-water system, as shown in Fig. 1, was initiated on Pier G in September 1964. A year later a second system was in operation on Pier J . It is the purpose of this paper to acquaint the reader with:the considerations which resulted in the decision to produce both Pier G and Pier ''a wells by this means;, a description of the power-water flow through the systems;, the surface plant installation costs and those of the subsurface equipment;, the direct costs of operation and maintenance through October 1966 and problems encountered with the systems; and, finally,, the approaches to potential areas of cost reduction.SELECTION OF A HYDRAULIC POWER-WATER SYSTEMLong Beach Oil Development Company had operated a closed-power oil hydraulic-pumping system since 1952. Experience during those 12 years indicated this type of system was as economical to operate and maintain as other lifting systems and, therefore, would be an ideal one for Piers G and J .Water was selected as the power fluid on the basis of lower capital investment. If crude oil were used, pipelines would have to be laid to Piers G and J because the oil produced from these piers would be low-gravity and unsuitable as a power fluid. Also, additional facilities for retention and cleaning the power oil would have to be constructed. Other considerations, such as safety from fire hazards and less potential damage from surface leaks, were also involved.A controlling condition in the selection of pumping equipment was the desire of the City of Long Beach to carry out a policy of keeping all pumping units below ground level in this general area. This policy immediately removed all rod-pumping equipment from consideration. of limited experience, and this experience indicated that operation and maintenance would be more expensive than hydraulic pumping at the anticipated well rates.THE PHYSICAL SYSTEMSPower water (lease fresh water) starts from a 500-bbl galvanized uncoated circulating tank. Because of wellhead and down-hole leakage, makeup water is added to the circulating tank through a felt cartridge filter. A water lubricant is added to the circulating tank in proportion to the makeup water to maintain the lubricity.",,American Petroleum Institute

Murray(Tenneco Oil Company),,,,,,API-68-022,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"A parasite tubing method of aerating mud was developed for reduction of hydrostatic pressure to avoid lost circulation and reduce drilling costs in southwestern Utah. This pressure-reduction method completely eliminated the lost-circulation problem, and drilling costs were substantially reduced. The method consists of attaching tubing to intermediate casing with prefabricated clamps and injecting air down the tubing into the casing-drill-pipe annulus. The parasite tubing setting depth is determined by the maximum pressure reduction anticipated to avoid lost circulation. The total pressure reduction being used is a function of tubing depth, air/mud ratio, and mud weight. Since lost circulation was eliminated, emphasis is being placed upon improving other drilling-control factors resulting in minimum-cost drilling. The parasite tubing method of aerating mud has proved to have application in other lost-circulation areas.INTRODUCTIONThe lost-circulation problems in the Upper Valley Field, Garfield County, Utah have been solved, and drilling costs of 6,900-ft wells have been reduced more than $100,000 per well.The first five wells in the Upper Valley Field were plagued with lost-circulation intervals, and numerous attempts were made to solve this drilling problem. Mud with high concentrations of lost-circulation material, conventional aerated mud (down-drill-pipe method), air-mist, and stiff foam were all tried unsuccessfully.Earlier studies indicated a definite correlation between surface elevation and the severity of the lost-circulation problem. It was noted that the fastest and lowest cost well of the first five drilled was the No. 1, in which conventional mud was used with only minor mud losses. This well was drilled at the lowest surface elevation. Consequently, effort was made to develop a technique that would allow drilling the higher-elevation wells under the same or slightly less circulating pressure condition as the No. 1. However, the technique developed must not have the inherent disadvantages of the conventional aeration methods which had already been tested.The parasite tubing method was developed, tested, and used successfully on two wells-Upper Valley No. 7 and No. 8. This report is a detailed discussion of the design considerations, equipment requirements, operating procedures, and results of field testing.This method may have application in other areas which have severe lost circulation, especially in the Rocky Mountains. Areas which have been passed over because of severe lost-circulation problems might now be economically explored with this technique.DESIGN CONSIDERATIONStatic fluid levels measured in the first five Upper Valley Field wells during periods of lost circulation averaged 1,000 ft from the surface. In designing the parasite string, it was necessary to consider the possible fluid level and inject the air at some point sufficiently below this level to achieve the desired pressure reduction.The major lost-circulation interval was in the Navajo formation at a depth of approximately 3,000 ft. Fluid-level measurements indicated that this formation would break down if the circulating pressure gradient exceeded 0.35 psi/ft. Consequently, the point of injection and the air/mud ratio were designed for a maximum circulating pressure of 1,000 psi at 3,000 ft.Two-phase vertical flowing pressure gradient curves for mud and air were not available. However, two-phase gas-lift curves' used in production calculations were available and could be reasonably applied to a mud-air system in a drilling annulus.",,American Petroleum Institute

Of Halliburton Co.),,,,,,API-68-029,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"Possible perforating damage to casing and cement in production zones has indicated the desirability of improving the casing-cementing materials. Problems generally encountered may be casing splitting and cement fracturing as a result of using either too large a charge of explosives or an excessive number of shots per interval. This paper presents a new type of cementing composition containing synthetic fibers which helps eliminate damage to either the casing or cement, minimizing channeling between zones. In addition, its properties should provide a more satisfactory cement in areas where high-pressure fracturing may create unduly high cement-sheath stresses. The importance of improving cementing characteristics to overcome the detrimental effects of perforating under some conditions is shown by laboratory data. Field case histories exist from several troublesome areas of the country to help establish the successful application of this material in decreasing damage to either casing or cement, and reducing communication between relatively close-spaced zones.INTRODUCTIONAs completion practices become more complex, the need for better cementing materials to withstand the forces created by either perforating or fracturing has become more and more evident. This is especially true in primary completions, because of the different formation conditions being encountered and the need to reduce remedial cementing operations. These problem conditions may range from extremely long producing intervals to close producing horizons where isolation between zones is essential to achievement of a successful cementing job.Most of the techniques recommended in the past to improve primary completions have dealt mainly with either displacement rates for better mud removal or methods to improve cement bonding by both mechanical and chemical means. These techniques should not be disregarded, because they are still highly important in designing well-completion programs. However, very little investigation has been made in the area of improving the mechanical properties of the set cement.The use of synthetic fibers1 in the cement is very unique, because it not only results in increased strength but also improves the resiliency characteristics of the cement. This allows higher stress levels to be imposed, because the fibers act as small reinforcing rods to transmit the load more evenly throughout the cement in the same manner that steel improves this property in concrete. Primary purpose of the fibers in a cementing composition is to increase the impact and shatter resistance of the set material when it is subjected to perforation, because the blast forces produce shock and vibration which may be capable of damaging the cement. Another situation where shock and vibration occur is during drilling operations, particularly on the bottom joints when drilling out the shoe. Therefore, the possibility of using fiber-reinforced cementing compositions to overcome these stresses may be highly desirable.An additional benefit of the fiber-reinforced cement results from the extremely high tensile yield strength of the fibers; and in most cases its elasticity returns the cement to its original shape, even though the compressive yield strength of the cement has been exceeded",,American Petroleum Institute
743,321276,,Corrosivity of Chrome-treated Sodium Lignosulfonate Packer-fluid Systems,B.G. Chesser(Milchem Inc.),,,,,,API-68-038,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"Study of chrome-treated sodium lignosulfonate both in the laboratory and in the field has shown that this mud additive is not corrosive in practical packer-fluid environments but, in fact, induces certain corrosion-inhibiting properties to the packer mud. Steel coupons exposed to field lignosulfonate muds under simulated packer-fluid conditions consistently exhibit corrosion rates below 1 mpy. P-105 steel C rings exposed to lignosulfonate muds under a wide variance of stress, temperature, and time did not undergo stress-corrosion cracking even in the presence of soluble sulfides. To corroborate these results, inspection of several strings of P-grade tubing which had been in service with lignosulfonate packer muds showed no brittle failures. A film is formed on the steel in the presence of the lignosulfonate mud which shows it to be inhibitive against sulfide stress cracking. Environmental conditions and supplementary studies suggest that this film may be composed principally of magnetite (Fe304) which is considered to be protective on ferrous metals.INTRODUCTIONA fairly voluminous literature has been developed concerning the corrosivity of lignosulfonate muds. The pyrolysis products of lignosulfonate powders have been studied by DTA methods, the effect of hydrogen on stressed metals in acid has been demonstrated, and instances wherein corrosion has occurred when some lignosulfonate has been present in a packer fluid have been cited. Little data have been presented, however, of studies made to directly relate the effect of lignosulfonates in mud systems to this corrosion or embrittlement of tubular steel. The importance of the corrosion problem in drilling and packer fluids makes it imperative that direct cause-and-effect studies be made and that this problem be elevated from conjecture, inference, and supposition to that of established relationships and fact. It is the purpose of this paper to present data showing the effect of the lignosulfonate mud on steel tubular goods exposed under packer-fluid conditions.Lignosulfonates have been the primary mud-conditioning agents for the past 15 years; particularly in the deeper, higher-pressure wells where weighted drilling fluids are required. Thus it is not surprising that the lignosulfonate system became the principal type of packer fluid in these areas. This widespread use of lignosulfonate increased the odds that any tubular failures that might occur would happen in this system, regardless of the cause. The stress-corrosion questionaire of the API Study Committee on Tubular Goods1and the NACE T-1 D4 Task Group questionnaire2revealed that failures have occurred in lignosulfonate packer muds. Many of these failures were interpreted as sulfide stress cracking, primarily because a positive test for sulfide was obtained on the surface of the failed pipe. Since the lignosulfonate is a sulfur-bearing compound, it is naturally suspect as a source for these sulfides. Several methods are used to modify the lignosulfonate for use in drilling muds, including blending with other additives. The data compiled and covered in this paper specifically relate to the chrome-treated sodium lignosulfonate3and are not intended to include lignosulfonates prepared by other methods or other lignosulfonate compositions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Simpson(Baroid Divison National Lead Co.),,,,,,API-68-046,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"For over 20 years the industry has been concerned with problems of gelation and suspension of solids in packer fluids. In recent years, considerable attention has been given to corrosion aspects. This paper discusses types of water-base packer fluids used in the past and difficulties encountered. It presents laboratory data comparing suspension agents for oil muds, and cites field examples of oil muds used successfully to suspend weighting material and protect against corrosion. Corrosion protection when using clear liquids as packer fluids is also discussed.DISCUSSIONWhat is required of a fluid to be left in the casing-tubing annulus of a well? This question has been given careful consideration from time to time over the past 20 years, yet is still a controversial matter. There are logical explanations why the packer-mud problem has in the past become acute, has appeared to be solved, then has reappeared in somewhat different form. To understand the situation, two things should be kept in mind: 1, Operations are simplified if the fluid used for drilling the well can be left as the packer fluid. 2, Performance of a packer fluid involves consideration of hydraulic properties (density, rheology, gelation), as well as corrosion characteristics.A brief review can illustrate how changes made to provide a better drilling fluid have sometimes created packer-fluid problems; how packer fluids designed for better hydraulic properties may have made corrosion problem more severe; and how packer fluids designed for corrosion protection have, at times, resulted in hydraulic problems.High-pH MudsDuring the 1940's, difficulties were being experienced in controlling flow properties of the weighted muds required for drilling abnormally pressured formations. A salt-water flow or severe cement contamination would thicken the mud excessively, cause stuck pipe and lost circulation, and result in the hole being lost. Development of the high-pH lime-treated mud gave much better tolerance for salt water, cement, and shale solids. This mud came into widespread use for drilling and was customarily left in the casing-tubing annulus upon completion. Although little attention was given corrosivity of mud at that time, the highly alkaline lime mud probably gave good corrosion protection.Unfortunately, experience soon showed that this type of mud gelled excessively or even solidified when exposed to down-hole formation temperatures for any significant period of time. Laboratory studies reported by Gray, Neznayko, and Gilkeson1revealed that free hydroxyl in the high-pH mud reacted with silica and silicates to form cementitious materials, resulting in gelation or solidification of the mud. In spite of years of research, no practical solution to this problem has yet been found.Raising the pH of a water-base mud that is to be left in a well can lessen the corrosivity. If there is excess alkali and ample clay concentration in the mud, however, the foregoing reactions will cause gelation and result in a time-consuming expensive operation when the well is worked over. If there is insufficient clay in the packer mud, settling of weighting material will necessitate washing over tubing and make workover operations expensive. If the concentration of alkali in mud is exceeded by that of acid formers (such as the thinners and filtration-control agents used in most drilling muds), the pH of the mud will eventually drop and the corrosion protection will be lost.",,American Petroleum Institute

Covlin(Pan American Petroleum Corp.),,,,,,API-68-053,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"Liner cementing has been the subject for considerable field experimentation in the Elk Basin Field of Wyoming and Montana. The primary objective of liner-cementing work has been to provide for zone and formation isolation so each productive zone can be properly stimulated and produced in such a way as to effect maximum recovery of hydrocarbons from a multi-zoned reservoir. The materials and techniques used in setting and cementing liners in Elk Basin, in an effort to achieve this objective, are reviewed. Notable progress has been made over the past 2 years toward eliminating or at least minimizing behind-the-pipe communication between zones of oil production. Various preflushes, cements, and displacement techniques have been used. Numerous types of liner equipment have also been used - such as varnished and plain pipe, sand-coated joints, metal petal baskets, and the external inflatable casing packer. Approximately 80 Elk Basin wells have been aeepened and equipped with liners of various sizes and lengths. Of these, 34 have been equipped during the past 2 years. It is concluded that, through application of engineering principles and recent technological advancements in cementing, zone and formation isolation can be effectively accomplished.INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, operators have given increased recognition to the importance of initial well-completion work. A good initial completion provides for maximum initial production, with a well bore in such condition as to perform future successful remedial repairs. Of utmost consideration is successful primary cementing, as maximum recovery can only be achieved through isolation or segregation of formations and zones in the well bore.During recent years, several advancements have been made toward improvement of primary cementing to effect segregation and provide for selective well completion work. The displacement of cement at high rates has been recognized as an effective means of mud removal since early 1948.1In 1963 the application of the contact-time principle together with turbulent flow was introduced.2More recently, investigations have centered around the low-displacement-rate principle3and the influence of an eccentric annulus on mud displacement.4Expansive cements have also been given consideration.5,6In 1964, Lynes, Inc. developed the external casing packer;7and in 1965, Bearden et al. introduced the deformable casing gasket.8Cementing, well treating, logging, and perforating companies have also made their contributions.The Elk Basin Field has been the scene for considerable experimentation in connection with these advancements toward achievement of zone isolation in the well bore. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to the problem and the results, and degree of success attained.THE ELK BASIN FIELDThe Elk Basin Field is located in the north portion of the Big Horn Basin along the Wyoming-Montana border, approximately 50 miles east of Yellowstone National Park (Fig. 1). It was discovered in 1914 in the shallow Frontier sands and now produces from 5 geological horizons to a depth of 6,500 ft. The structure is an elongated asymmetrical anticline trending northwest-southeast, 7 miles long and 2 miles wide (Fig. 2).

At this early date, far-reaching problems - such as determining the optimum number, location, and size of island drilling sites - had to be resolved, using scant information regarding geology and productive limits.Policies affecting directional well design were originally predicated upon proved techniques and equipment. However, subsequent to the first spud in July 1965, design criteria have undergone continuous revision as new problems develop and additional experience is gained.Directional control and bore-hole surveys are subjects requiring attention. Considerable work has been devoted to obtaining more reliable surveys through improved procedures and more accurate instrumentationSECTION 1 : PREPARATION OF THE DRILLING ASSIGNMENTTHUMS Long Beach Company, through a process of competitive bidding, assumed the role of field contractor to the City of Long Beach, operator for the Long Beach Unit, East Wilmington Field, California, in April 1965. The areal extent of the Long Beach Unit properties is approximately 7,900 surface acres, consisting of 6,000 acres of submerged tidelands and 1,900 acres of residential and business tracts which are unavailable for drill-site areas (Fig. 1-1). Two remote dry-land drill-site areas were provided - one located some distance off the northwest corner of the Unit and the other adjacent to the southwestern Unit boundary - from which only about 10 percent of the total acreage could be developed.This section of the paper deals with the phases of planning, evaluation, and bore-hole design pertinent to the preparation of an effective drilling assignment.Section 2: Implementation of the Drilling AssignmentThe implementation of THUMS directional-drilling programs utilizes many special rig features and facilities, in combination with the most modern down-hole tools and drilling techniques. Each well presents variable conditions of profile, depth, and direction vs. formation dip and strike.Maintaining the well course within the prescribed 100-ft diameter cylinder and dog-leg severity tolerances, the hazard of sticking drill pipe and casing in high-angle holes through relatively soft formations, key-seating and differential-sticking tendencies - augmented by other factors - are compounded to produce complex operating conditions.Section 2 deals with various program details, equipment, and techniques utilized in accomplishing the drilling and completion assignment, plus a supplemental analysis of drilling performance.",,American Petroleum Institute
747,321280,,Tubing Load Distribution Indicator- An Aid to Reciprocation during Cementing of Multiple Strings,Martin E. Chenevert(Esso Production Research Co.)|Charles W. Manry(Arco Chemical Co. Channelview Texas),,,,,,API-68-092,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"A newly developed tool makes pipe reciprocation more probable and safer while cementing multiple strings of tubing. This new tool1 (called the tubing load distribution indicator or TLDI) shows the instantaneous tension in each of two or more strings of tubing as they are reciprocated (raised and lowered about 25 ft), thereby allowing the driller to apply maximum safe pull during the entire reciprocation process. Without it, the driller would use the standard hook-load indicator and restrict his maximum pull to the tensile strength of one string. This maximum is based on the assumption that it is possible for only one string to be stuck; thus all additional tension applied would be acting on the one string. Because of this, reciprocation of multiple strings has usually been restricted to wells shallower than 10,000 ft. Through the use of the TLDI, it is now possible to quickly observe the stress in each string and proceed to pull until the strings become free or the maximum allowable stress in one of them is approached. By having higher allowable hook loads, the driller can thus reciprocate for longer periods of time to insure a good cement job. To date, the TLDI has been used successfully on about 25 wells, some of which were deeper than 12,000 ft. On at least two of these, reciprocation would have been impossible without the TLDI units. The conclusion is that the TLDI has immediate application in multiple completion operations. This tool has been licensed on a non-exclusive basis.INTRODUCTIONIndustry has long recognized the substantial benefits realized with tubingless completions. Savings result from two main factors: first, the elimination of a casing string; and second, savings achieved in later workover costs. More recent techniques have extended this concept to dual tubingless completions. However, it appears that the multiple strings in a single borehole present an unfavorable flow channel2 for the cement (Fig. l), which results in poor mud displacement if the strings are not reciprocated and, therefore, poor cement jobs. It has recently been shown3 that reciprocation of the pipe while cementing has greatly increased the efficiency of mud displacement. The reciprocation technique consists of raising and lowering the tubing in the borehole at a rate of about 20 cycles per hour as the cement displaces mud from the annulus. Unfortunately, reciprocation is not always possible because in some instances the tubing becomes stuck. Attempts to pull it free are often unsuccessful because the driller is restricted to a pull equal to the tensile strength of one string of tubing.The tool this paper describes, the tubing load distribution indicator, removes this extreme restriction on the driller by showing him the pull in each of two strings. Because the load is distributed between the strings, the TLDI thereby raises the safe level of pull to as high as twice the previous level. With higher pulls, the tubing is often freed, reciprocated, and properly cemented.",,American Petroleum Institute

Pennebaker(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-68-184,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"Recent improvement in the art of log interpretation and analysis of drilled cuttings have made it possible to measure formation pressures from logs after wells are drilled or from cuttings circulated from the bottom of the hole while drilling. Information prior to drilling, however, has been restricted to that estimated from nearby wells. Where there are no nearby wells, pressure information is completely unknown. This paper discusses a method whereby information obtained from routine seismic field records can be used to predict the depth to abnormal-pressure formations and the approximate magnitude of these pressures. An analysis of a large number of well-velocity surveys revealed a close correlation between interval velocity, or interval travel time, and pressure. It also revealed that interval travel time varies exponentially with depth in a predictable manner. Any departure from this normal trend signifies abnormal pressure or gross changes in lithology. A predictive method results from the fact that interval velocities can be calculated from seismograph data using techniques well-known in geophysics. Results compare favorably to those obtained by well-velocity surveys. With this method it has been found possible to determine pressures with sufficient accuracy so that the proper casing can be made available at the location, the optimum drilling-mud weighting schedule and the holesize selection can be made, and the proper rig can be selected. The method has been used with good results over a wide area along the Texas Gulf Coast including continental shelf locations.INTRODUCTIONOptimum planning for a safe and economical drilling operation requires an accurate estimate of formation pressures and depths so that proper hole sizes, casing programs, and. mud-weighting schedules can be selected. Methods of measuring pore pressures from well logs have greatly improved the accuracy of these pressure predictions in areas where there are sufficient wells for adequate control. In areas of poor geological control deep exploratory drilling can be extremely hazardous and costly for lack of adequate pressure information.Recently considerable discussion of abnormal-pressure technology has appeared in published literature. Quantitative relations between various log parameters measured in drilling wells and pore pressures have been developed.1,2All are based on the relationship between shale compaction and abnormal pressure. The subject of clay compaction and its role in generating abnormal fluid pressure is by now well-known and will not be discussed in detail here. This subject has been treated in an excellent manner in the literature.Techniques for detecting the proximity of abnormal pressure formations while drilling, based on observation of changes in rate of penetration, cuttings density, mud temperature, salinity, hole instability, and other properties, are now used extensively. Although these techniques are of considerable help in following pressure trends through the transition zone into abnormal pressure, they are not predictive techniques. A method has been needed for predicting subsurface pressures ahead of the bit, including prediction capabilities prior to moving a rig on location.",,American Petroleum Institute

Data on some 300 electrified wells were used to verify the conclusions. The model required 650 installed horsepower at a capital cost of $1 1 1,100 and showed a 27-percent return on investment. It was determined that gas engines cost 1.75 times as much to operate and maintain as do electric motors and that oil fields may be converted to electric power for $2,200 to $2,500 per well.INTRODUCTIONOne of the more difficult problems involved in the electrification of an oil field is to obtain an accurate estimate of costs and an acceptable return on investment without undue delay or detailed design. It is the purpose of this paper to give the design engineer or budget-minded superintendent concise and reasonably accurate data to rapidly estimate the cost and return on investment of an oil-field electrification project.Costs have been accumulated from five recent electrification projects involving nearly 300 wells ranging in depth from 500 to 11,000 ft and from jack-line operations to some of the largest pumping units available. Motor horsepowers have ranged from 3 to 75 on pumping units and larger prime movers on field production equipment. Data obtained from these electrification projects and costs published herein are of an average nature and should be used as such. These data are representative of most California oil fields.Averages obtained from past electrifications have been applied to a 50-well model oil field and payout has been calculated on this model. Some of the average costs used are cost per mile of three-phase primary and secondary power line, cost per well service hookup, cost per transformer setting, cost per motor (for model only), and maintenance costs.THE MODELThe model oil field has been set up typical of Southern California, but could be adjusted for any other area. It is assumed that an engine mechanic's labor could be eliminated by electrifying the production facilities on a 50-well field. This is in line with past experience showing elimination of 6 mechanics for 282 wells. Well depth and production were not averaged, but were chosen to be representative of this area. Well depth was assumed to be 5,000 ft with 50 BID gross production on 1 0-acre spacing.Down-hole volumetric efficiency ranged from 26.4 to 81.7 percent yielding an average of 36.6 percent. Forty-percent volumetric efficiency was used for the model. A 64-in. stroke unit, operating at 10-1/2 spm with a 1-1/4-in. pump operating at 40 percent volumetric efficiency, would produce 50 BID from 5,000 ft. Using these figures, theoretical horsepower is calculated (using hydraulic horsepower and a 40-percent volumetric efficiency) to be 9.41 hp per well. Ten-horsepower, 480-volt 3-phase NEMA-D induction motors are used in the model.All of the past projects used in this study have included electrification of production facilities other than wells. Total auxiliary requirements have ranged from 8 to 25 percent of the total horsepower connected. Twenty-three percent was used for the model, or a total of 150 hp (two 50-hp and two 25-hp motors) will be installed.",,American Petroleum Institute

Metallurgical factors are also involved, as revealed by experimentation and practical experience. Code requirements are explained. Practical advice is given for overcoming the problems that may be encountered.INTRODUCTIONThere are all kinds of troubles that can develop in equipment in northern climates. These may result from improper selection of materials, unsuitable overall design, inappropriate design or choice of particular components, manufacturing defects with special significance for operation at low temperatures, and so on. It is not surprising that suitable equipment and materials could in most cases be provided, but this would entail unwelcome increases in costs. Moreover, in Canada at least, the problems have been attacked piecemeal, and there is no systematic approach available to those who are not immediately deterred by the prospect of paying more for what they need. At the University of Alaska, the engineering faculty places emphasis on special training of students in the unique aspects of work in the north. In the U.S.S.R., a more unified approach to northern problems has been developing, and they are considering the establishment of a Research Institute for Technical Problems of the north.1The present paper is limited to the consideration of two aspects of the problem: first, brittle fracture, which is certainly the most important single material problem; and second, the effect of low temperatures on welding.BRITTLE FAILUREStrength and BrittlenessOn considering the metals used in oil-field operations, it is apparent that steels are by far the most important. These may be plain-carbon or alloy steels, cheap or expensive steels, structural steels, machinery steels, or special steels. There is the fact in common that sometimes they do not behave as they should in cold weather.In order to consider how the strength of steel is affected by the cold, it is necessary to agree on what is meant by strength. Almost all design is based on yield strength, or the load that unit sections will sustain without deforming significantly. Fig. 1 plots strength vs. temperature for pure iron in simple tension, and shows that yield strength actually increases as the temperature falls2This may appear to be good, but it has some bad consequences. At a certain temperature, the yield stress and fracture stress meet; and below this temperature, the pure iron will break suddenly without deformation, like glass.For pure iron, very low temperatures are needed to achieve this in a simple tensile test,2 as shown in Fig. 1. However, there are other factors that can increase the yield stress relative to the fracture stress-composition and certain impurities, notches and stress concentrations, and high speed of load applications.",,American Petroleum Institute

Both systems are reviewed and contrasted in some detail, with emphasis on placement techniques which can mean success or failure with each system.INTRODUCTIONSand production in producing oil or water wells is controlled by either mechanical devices, such as slotted liners and gravel packs, or in-situ consolidation by chemical means. Mechanical devices are installed in the well bore opposite the perforated producing interval and act as down-hole filters. Sand consolidation involves the conversion of part of the formation nearest the well bore into an artificial sandstone. Most of the sand-consolidation processes now in use utilize organic resins or plastics as the cementing material1,2,3Consolidation is often preferred over the mechanical methods for two principal reasons:1, the well bore is left free of obstruction, thus facilitating multiple completions4and2, small sand particles are immobilized at some distance in the formation where the hydrodynamic forces tending to dislodge them are minimal4,5Unfortunately, the sand-consolidation methods are expensive and are therefore used almost exclusively in regions 'that produce from short intervals. Also, in-situ consolidation methods are sensitive to placement techniques and, if improperly applied, result in poor - if any - sand control and in some cases permeability impairment.The discussions presented in this paper are based on experience gained with Shell's EPOSANDB processes, of which there are two types. Though both systems use epoxy resin, they are quite different in the manner in which resin is placed at the sand grain-to-grain contact - one by capillary action, the other by overflush displacement. Understanding the differences of the systems will facilitate deciding which to choose for a particular instance. The experience learned with these systems is believed to be applicable to any others which accomplish resin placement in a similar manner. It is the purpose of this paper to review some of the considerations that should be observed in controlling sand by in-situ consolidation, and to discuss a new Shell consolidation system which has not heretofore been presented to the industry.THE EPOSAND 9 SYSTEMShell first introduced its epoxy system in the United States under the name of EPIKOTE in 1961. Since that time, the process has been steadily improved and renamed to signify a new product. It has been called in order EPIKOTE, EPOSAND 7, EPOSAND 8, and EPOSAND 9. The first three are discontinued. EPOSAND 9 is a phase separating system which, like its predecessors, is a dilute solution of epoxy resin in a hydrocarbon solvent. When combined with a curing (the Fig 1 and 2 are available in full paper) agent, a liquid-resin phase separates from the solvent after a period of time and solidifies. This is shown schematically in Fig. 1. After separation, but still in the liquid state, the resin is drawn by capillary forces to the pendular region of the sand grains. Here it solidifies and cements the grains together.",,American Petroleum Institute

Data concerning pump intake pressures and causes of pump changes have been analyzed to optimize surface and bottom-hole pumping conditions.

Three of the four pay zones are very fine to fine grain sandstone with dolomitic cement, and the fourth zone is micro-crystalline dolomite with porosity due to vugs.Table 1 shows reservoir and PVT data of interest. The reservoir originally had a static bottom-hole pressure of 6,600 psi with a 450-psi bubble point. The crude is 35 API gravity and wells produce with a GOR of less than 100 at a 30-psig separation pressure.The discovery well, perforated in only the 2 sandstone zones, had an initial flowing rate of 800 BOPD, but then declined to a rate of approximately 530 BOPD, no water, with a 30-psig tubing pressure. Based on gradient curves, the flowing bottom-hole pressure was estimated to be 5,000 psi, indicating a PI of 0.3. With a low GOR, the well could not flow at rates much above 500 BOPD. Therefore, artificial lift was installed to maximize production and to determine the well's inflow performance relationships.The initial inflow performance relationship data were used as a basis for deciding the best type of artificial lift for the well. Beam pumping at rates greater than 800 BPD from only 7,000 ft was not feasible because of high rod stress (38,000 psi) and gear-box torque (700,000 in-lb). No lift gas was available and electrical power for multistage centrifugal pumping was unavailable. However, the well, being deep and providing high volumes with a low GOR, appeared to be ideally suited for hydraulic pumping or, more specifically, for casing-free hydraulic pumping.",,American Petroleum Institute

This paper compares the new API method with the more conventional, simplified method which has been used for so many years. Direct comparisons are made between maximum polished-rod load, minimum polished-rod load, and peak torque on the gear reducer. Both the API and the older method are then compared with measured results taken from 77 wells, covering a wide range of conditions.INTRODUCTIONThe new API recommended practice was first published in March 1967. It was the final result of a thorough and time-consuming effort that began in 1954. In that year, Sucker Rod Pumping Research, Inc. was created by a group of users and manufacturers of sucker-rod pumping equipment to make a study in depth of the many complex problems associated with artificial lift mechanisms. To perform the necessary work, Midwest Research Institute of Kansas City was retained. Midwest Research Institute, in the beginning, attempted to study sucker-rod pumping systems through use of a mechanical model designed to incorporate all of the important well variables. Although this approach did work, it was not entirely satisfactory. The mechanical model proved difficult to use and control, and the data obtained could not be easily correlated. It did, however, provide a better understanding of the many complex variables encountered in a sucker-rod pumping system. Midwest then set up an electric analog which was able to produce a large amount of data that could be more easily correlated. Having completed the project, a final report was submitted to all participating members of Sucker Rod Pumping Research as well as to the API. ? D. Schropp (Phillips Petroleum Co., Santa Barbara, Calif.) made an outstanding contribution to the industry by condensing and re-plotting the mass of data contained in Midwest's final report into six families of curves. These were made available to API.The API Committee on Standardization of Production Equipment, at that time headed by Max Halderson, Phillips Petroleum Co., then created a task force to study the final report. Ed Pierce, Sunray DX Oil Co., was chairman of this task group, which included top engineering and production talent from many major users and manufacturers. It was hoped that, after studying Midwest's report, the task group would be in a position to recommend to the Production Equipment Committee that an API recommended practice be adopted. The task force did an outstanding job in taking the mass of data from the report and presenting it in a more usable and convenient form. The curves prepared by Schropp, previously mentioned, form the basis of all calculations inAPZ RP 11L.SCOPE OFAPI RP 11LIn any sucker-rod pumping system, polished-rod loads and, consequently, counterbalance and peak torque are complex functions of many well variables.",,American Petroleum Institute

Griffin(Midwest Research Institute Kansas City Missouri),,,,,,API-68-232,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCKER-ROD STRINGSThe natural frequency of the sucker-rod string is the most important single factor affecting oil-well pumping performance. Both the pumping mechanism and the pump induce vibrations into the string, vibrations whose magnitudes depend upon the relationship between the frequency of the induced vibrations and the natural frequency of the sucker rod. Higher harmonic frequencies are also important in the analysis of sucker-rod behavior.This section on the vibration characteristics of sucker rod strings will show that the natural frequency of a tapered rod string is appreciably different than that of a straight rod string of the same length. It will also show that the relationship between the harmonics is different for a tapered rod string than for a straight rod string.The basic input to the sucker-rod system is the motion induced by the pumping mechanism at the top. This motion is transmitted in varying amplitude to all parts of the string, including the pump. The pump, however, is a non-linear device whose action causes a very complex interrelationship between force and motion. As a result of the pump action, additional vibrations are generated; these vibrations are also transmitted in varying magnitude to all parts of the string.In general, the pumping mechanism induces a large amplitude of force at the pumping frequency, a significant amount of force at two and perhaps three times pumping speed, and only very small amounts of force at higher frequencies. On the other hand, the pump can induce large-amplitude forces at the fundamental pumping frequency and at all odd harmonics up to as much as 9 or 11 times the pumping speed. In addition, some even harmonics may be induced. This pump action means, for example, that a well being pumped at a speed equal to 0.4 times the rod natural frequency will have significant force inputs at frequencies as high as the following. (the formula is available in full paper)The interrelationship between force and displacement at the pump is so mathematically complex as to make an overall analytical solution impossible. Nevertheless, considerable insight can be gained as to well behavior by considering carefully the rod behavior at varying frequencies. For this purpose, consider a sucker-rod system with a pump being excited by an input sinusoidal motion at the top. (the formula is available in full paper)Although the forces and displacements at the pump are unknown, they do exist, are periodic, and can each be resolved into a Fourier series with frequencies off,2f,3f, . . . wherefis the pumping frequency. For analysis, we will consider the effect of a single component of the vibration, and let this component vary over the entire range of possible pumping speeds plus harmonics. The string behavior can be accurately considered as being composed of two separate parts:. A rod string excited sinusoidally at the top and free at the bottom; plus. A rod string fixed at the top and subjected to sinusoidal displacements at the bottom. The latter must be of the correct magnitude and phase to produce the same pump displacement and force as the complete string.",,American Petroleum Institute

Of California),,,,,,API-68-250,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, New York, New York",1968,"This paper discusses testing of a special nylon-jacketed steel strand being used as a continuous sucker rod for pumping oil wells. The combination of flexibility, corrosion resistance, and load capacity found in this unique new development is the result of the latest research in plastics and high-strength steels. Field tests have proved the feasibility of actuating down-hole oil-well pumps with this multi-wire line. Work is continuing, to establish operating limitations and economics of this method.INTRODUCTIONFor more than two years the producing department of Standard Oil Co, of California, Western Operations, Inc., has had a test program in progress to evaluate a continuous, flexible sucker rod for pumping oil wells. Pumping with a cable or wire rope is not a new nor an original concept. Rope constructions and materials of many types have been tried over the years, with limited success. Causes of the generally unsatisfactory results have been low strength, poor abrasion resistance, fatigue, incompatibility with well fluids, corrosion, and lack of adequate knowledge and techniques. The nylon-jacketed flexible sucker rod developed and manufactured as a joint effort of Bethlehem Steel Corp. and E. I. duPont deNemours Co. has the combination of material, construction, and corrosion resistance not previously available to the oil industry.A continuous, non-rigid sucker rod, with a potential of equal or better ultimate service life than conventional sucker rods and which can be reeled in and out of a well, offers attractive advantages. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss the problems, successes, and failures experienced to date in seven test wells where jacketed flexible, sucker rods have been installed as replacements for conventional rods.DESCRIPTION OF THE FLEXIBLE SUCKER RODThe flexible sucker rod (FSR for short) is a modified bridge-strand construction made up of 37 wires of high-strength steel. Each wire is 0.080 in. in diameter and has a minimum tensile strength of 240,000 psi. A corrosion-resistant coating is applied to each wire and it is enclosed in a 10-mil nylon jacket. A 25-mil jacket encases the entire strand to serve as a protective shield for the wire jackets, as well as a mechanical restraint for the wires. Nylon is used as the jacketing material because of its unique combination of properties. These include: resistance to crude oils, excellent wet abrasion resistance, toughness, low creep, high softening point, and low permeability.1Fig. 1 is an illustration of the strand in-cross section. overall diameter is 0.750 in. Weight per foot is 0.728 Ib, or less than half that of a 3/4-in. conventional sucker rod. Total cross-sectional area of steel is 0.186 sq in., as compared to 0.442 sq. in. for a 3/4-in. conventional rod. Breaking strength of the strand is 42,000 lb. The strand modulus of elasticity is 24 x 106psi vs. 29 x 106for conventional sucker rods, and approximately 14 x 106for 6-strand wire rope.",,American Petroleum Institute

This feature, combined with the capability of controlling the mobility of fluids subsequently injected, results in high recovery efficiencies. This recovery technique is applicable to reservoirs in either secondary or tertiary condition. A slug of micellar solution is injected into a reservoir, followed by a bank of thickened water to prevent premature break-through of the final drive water. These micellar solutions are surfactant-stabilized dispersions of oil and water, and may also contain small quantities of other additives. Laboratory flooding results have shown that small pore volume slugs of micellar solutions are very efficient in recovering oil. Field testing has proved technical feasibility. Additional testing is under way to determine economic parameters and suitable types of reservoirs.INTRODUCTIONNew techniques are being studied to increase oil recovery.1-8, inclPolymer solutions are becoming an important means of controlling mobility in a water flood. Thermal methods, such as in-situ combustion and steam injection, are being used in reservoirs containing viscous crudes. Miscible processes and surfactant flooding are receiving attention as methods of eliminating or reducing interfacial tension to increase recovery.Exotic recovery processes have been considered primarily for secondary operations. Economics are unfavorable in most cases for tertiary operations. Some processes, such as polymer flooding, are not technically feasible when oil is at residual saturation.Studies with micellar solutions have led to a new miscible-type water-flooding method.$' These solutions contain surfactant, hydrocarbon, and water, and can be used in either secondary or tertiary operations.Field testing has been under way since 1962. Results substantiate technical feasibility. Field testing has started in Pennsylvania where operations are being undertaken with Pennzoil United, Inc.This paper presents the concept of micellar-solution flooding first. Then it discusses micellar-solution characteristics, followed by laboratory displacement results. Finally, the range of applicability of the technique is considered and the state of development reviewed.CONCEPT OF MISCIBLE-TYPE WATER FLOODINGUnit displacement efficiency and conformance determine the effectiveness of any recovery method. Flooding with micellar solutions combines the desirable qualities of 100-percent unit displacement efficiency with a high conformance. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the method under secondary and tertiary conditions. Micellar solutions serve as the displacement fluids and are the basis for the method. Stable movement of the slug through the reservoir is assured by the mobility buffer. Both oil-in-water emulsions and solutions of high molecular weight water-soluble polymers (thickened water) have been used as mobility buffers. Drive water used to propel the mobility buffer is the same as that used in a regular water flood.A properly designed slug completely displaces oil in that portion of the reservoir contacted. Some brines may not be completely displaced as the slug is injected. This depends on the rock type, in-place water salinity, and slug composition. In those cases where the saline water has little or no solubility in the slug, brine is displaced immiscibly.",,American Petroleum Institute

In 1950, a temperature survey was used almost exclusively to locate cement tops It was generally believed that the maximum time one could Walt after the plug was down to have a temperature differential great enough to determine top of cement was 12 hours. At that time the first concentrated effort was started to Improve temperature logging tools, techniques, and applications by men such as H Guyod1Electronic advancement, complemented by vivid imagination, resulted in the development of accurate and sensitivity gradient and differential temperature surveys This beginning led to many accepted logging techniques such as temperature profiles in water-injection wells (FlL), fracture-evaluation logs (FEL), and acid-evaluation logs (AEL). These have been used for locating old cement tops, gas entry, water channels, as water production logs, and to determine proper cement retarding agents in deep wells.Initial Steps in The Analysis Of Temperature SurveysThe first step to properly interpret a temperature survey is to determine why the temperature change exists, whether the temperature increases or decreases, what happened to the well immediately before the survey was run, and what was happening as it was being run From this point there is no single set of rules or techniques that can be followed which will apply to all temperature-logging applications The logger needs all the information that can be supplied to him before any temperature survey is attempted. This information is necessary to determine how and when a temperature survey should be run and which tools will provide the most accurate information Essential requirements for obtaining quality surveys are accurate and sensitive temperature logging equipment, magnetic collar locator for depth control, pressure-control equipment, and trained personnel to Interpret logs and direct operations at the well site.Because of the nature of the temperature changes in some applications, the survey has primarily been used in a qualitative sense There have been attempts in recent years to obtain quantitative data from temperature logs The data presented in the Shut-in Temp",,American Petroleum Institute

It is one capable of producing the natural heat energy of the earth to the surface with sufficient volume and physical properties to have commercial value. Thus may be assumed to be production of heat falling into four basic categories.Hot waterwith only enough heat to be used for heating purposes such as homes, greenhouses and possibly some industrial processes This is one of the types of geothermal energy developed to a considerable degree in Iceland. It can be economically important in geographic areas without plentiful fuel resources. No further discussion will be given of this category of geothermal energy.Superheated hot waterproduced at the surface retaining sufficient heat to flash off commercial quantities of steam under pressure to be used for electric-power generation with residual hot water separated from the steam. The residual water may be utilized or disposed of depending upon geographic and economic factors .These conditions exist in present proved production In Mexico, California, New Zealand, and Turkey. There are other areas where the condition exists and these are simply cited as well-known examples.Saturated or dry steamproduced at the surface with the superheated formation waters being flashed into steam at some point within the well bore. This class of production is obtained in certain areas around most of the major dry-steam geothermal producing areas, such as parts of New Zealand and Italy The condition is also known in certain areas of the United States not proved to be near dry-steam production. This condition can cause many production problems. It will be readily seen that any mineral matter dissolved in the produced water will be deposited in the well bore and can cause rapid plugging of the well Insofar as drillings problems are concerned, wells of categories I, I1 and I11 are very similar.Dry superheated steamproduced at the surface and apparently flashed at some point in the producing formation very remote from the well bore. It might be stated here that a difference of opinion among experts seems to exist on this point. The Big Geysers Field, however, is of this type production, as are some of the Italian and New Zealand fields After years of production, little or no evidence exists of plugging of well bores by mineral deposition. Therefore, it would appear the process of flashing water to steam occurs at some point far removed from the well bore This paper will be mainly concerned with this type well.DRILLlNG OPERATIONSDrilling operations in the first three categories are very similar to oil or gas drilling operations with the one evident exception that an abnormal heat gradient exists.",,American Petroleum Institute

However, within a short time it became apparent that a new set of problems would have to be solved if cyclic steam injection was to be a financial success. In some areas the most perplexing problem was the failure of well casings to withstand elevated temperatures. In others it was necessary to revamp or enlarge oil-treating facilities to enable dehydration of the larger volumes of high temperature crude emulsions. All operators found it necessary to refine techniques to reduce high operating costs.The objective of this paper is to present a case history of cyclic steam injection, the related problems, and how they were solved by one California operator.BACKGROUNDThe key to successful operation of the Guadalupe Field has frustrated oil men for over 15 years Continental Oil Company drilled the discovery well in 1949, but did not develop commercial production from this 10 API gravity reservoir which has an average thickness of 40 ft and an average depth of 2,700 ft The Thornbury Drilling Company acquired the lease by purchase in 1950 and drilling was resumed Union Oil Co of California became the operator in 1953.The low production rates resulting from the high viscosity of the crude and sand-control problems plagued Union as it had the prior operators. Recognizing the potential of viscosity reduction by thermal methods, Union experimented with bottom-hole electric heaters, but cable failures and sand-control problems proved too much.During this period of experimentation it was determined that the sand could be controlled by gravel-packing. This method has essentially eliminated sand production in the field.In February 1964, cyclic steam injection tests were initiated. The response was encouraging. Solution of the new set of problems presented by steaming operations has encouraged Union to drill additional wells.CASING DESIGN AND CEMENTING TECHNIQUESCasings in 15 of 37 wells failed after being subjected to high temperatures during steaming. It is possible that additional failures occurred which have not been detected because production has not been affected. This failure rate was understandably prohibitive, and ?puff-and-puff? steaming operations were suspended until the problem could be solved.Casing design for, and failures from, thermally induced stresses has been discussed at length in numerous papers and reports and will not be further discussed in technical detail in this paper.",,American Petroleum Institute

Special considerations necessary for successfully cementing casing through formations where sub-freezing temperatures exist are discussed. Data representing the findings of a concentrated laboratory study are presentedin terms of cementing compositions performance when subjected to temperatures as low as 15 F.INTRODUCTIONDrilling activities have increased in the northernmost regions of Alaska and Canada. These areas have a unique stratum commonly referred to as the permafrost which reaches to depths in excess of 1,000 ft. The temperature of this stratum ranges from 15 to 27 F. Drilling operations proceed with only minor difficulties through frozen permafrost. However, if the fluids introduced into the drilled hole are sufficiently warm to promote thawing, major difficulties may arise slowing operations to a near standstill. Special precautions are being taken during drilling to prevent permafrost thawing. These include drilling the first 60-150 ft dry with a rat-hole rig , or using a polymer-type salt-base mud which can be maintained below the freezing temperature by refrigeration if necessary.After drilling the hole, it must be cased and cemented. Information concerning the properties and performance of cements in sub-freezing environments is limited. A few wells have been drilled and cemented through permafrost in Canada, however, no extended effort was made on a cement study. With the recent accelerated activity in northern Canada and Alaska, there is a need for more detailed low-temperature cement data. It is the authors' desire that this paper be useful in defining and solving the problems of cold temperature cementing.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe first comprehensive study of the performance of commonly used cements and additives for oil-well cementing in sub-freezing conditions was made by Major Foster L White, USAF,1in 1952.This investigation was for exploratory wells being drilled on the Alaskan Naval Petroleum Reserve No 4. Major White investigated a number of API classes of cements, using various additives as accelerators. As a result of his work, several wells were successfully cemented using pure gypsum. Although Major White was aware gypsum was not considered a permanent material, it was chosen as the more practical material as fast setting and rapid strength development occurs before it has time to freeze Major White's work showed that regular portland or Class C cement containing calcium chloride accelerator would freeze before setting at permafrost temperatures and, as a result of freezing, would not hydrate properly resulting in a weak set. Depressing the mixing-water freezing temperature by salt addition to the portland slurry delayed the set to an undesirably long waiting-on-cement (WOC) time.The Naval Petroleum Reserve No 4 cementing practices and results were published2,Briefly, results were reported as generally successful, although some experimentation led to one or two failures Trial use of portland with calcium chloride through the permafrost was reported unsatisfactory portland-cement with salt, allowing for extended set time, was successful as were the pure gypsum slurries. Portland cement with calcium chloride was used with no problems in the area below the permafrost.",,American Petroleum Institute

The unique simplified squeeze-cementing technique is used when abandonment of one zone to permit testing a second high-pressure zone is desired, while continuing to maintain the well under control in its permanently completed status This technique results in savings of $1,400 to $4,500 per job. The problem of limited injection rates down tubing during stimulation treatments and multiple zones to be selectively stimulated are overcome by a new technique whereby each zone is stimulated separately, followed by a ball seal-off' of the zone which is maintained while perforating and stimulating the next zone or zones All this is accomplished at the hydraulic-horsepower cost of treating one of the zones The stimulation of 17 separate zones in 7 wells has resulted m a 30-percent saving ($9,000 per well) in hydraulic-horsepower and perforating CostsDISCUSSIONWell CompletionsWells drilled for the high-pressure Morrow oil and gas reserves on the eastern flank of the Anadarko Basin in central Oklahoma encounter the top of the Morrow formation at 9,000 to 10,000 ft The Morrow sands are abnormally high-pressure formations, with bottom-hole pressures of 6,500 to 8,500 psi, and require mud weights of 12 to 15 lb/gal for control A number of formations above the Morrow will not tolerate mud weights m excess of 90 to 100 lb/gal (Fig. 1) Consequently, intermediate casing is set at 9,000 to 10,000 ft and the Morrow a drilled to 10,000 to 11,000 ft The depths and casing cost have resulted in the most economical program being 5 1/2-in intermediate casing and a 3 1/2-in liner set from the intermediate casing point to total depth.An uncommon liner pressure-cementing technique has resulted in over 50 successful jobs with only one failure resulting from communication between Morrow sands With reference to Fig. 2, the liner is run on 2-7/8-in tubing or the drill pipe in the conventional manner and landed at or near bottom with the top of the liner pack-off assembly located 200 ft above the bottom of the 5 1/2-in. intermediate casing An exact calculation of the volume of cement necessary to fill the annulus from bottom to the liner packer, plus the lower 300 ft inside the liner, is necessary before the job commences After the top plug reaches the second plug in the liner and sheers the latter, both plugs will be pumped to 300 ft off bottom The liner packer is set, and the remaining 300 ft of cement inside the liner is squeezed until the plugs are down.",,American Petroleum Institute

In recent years new high-energy explosives have been developed which are safe to handle, temperature- insensitive, and can be produced in various plasticities so they can be made to conform to well-bore or fracture surfaces These explosives are very applicable to explosive fracturing of oil and gas wells Renewed Interest in explosive fracturing has come about because hydraulic fracturing is not always successful in fields with unconnected permeability streaks Explosive fracturing can connect these streaks with flow channels, and then, if desired, these streaks may be hydraulically fractured through these flow channels Experience may show conventional high-explosive fracturing to be more convenient and less costly than hydraulic fracturing for certain applications and, in some cases, the only way a reservoir can be stimulatedINTRODUCTIONOn the morning of December 10, 1967, history was made in the form of an underground nuclear explosion called project Gasbuggy This nuclear detonation, which was the equivalent of 26,000 tons of TNT, occurred at 4,240 ft below ground level just 40 ft below the base of the 300-ft thick Pictured Cliffs gas sand in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico This was the first joint government-industry-sponsored commercial application of a nuclear device to increase the productivity of a mineral-producing formation Even though only limited data are presently available, gas pressure is up significantly in the chimney and the formation was fractured for hundreds of feet from the shot holeOther types of explosives have been in the news, too Several patents have been issued in recent years in the explosive-fracturing area The U S Bureau of Mines has done extensive testing in shallow rock formations New formulations have been tested in oil wells However, the use of explosives to stimulate petroleum-bearing formations is not a new art The first wells were shot with black powder, and, in 1865, nitroglycerin was introduced with pronounced results in the booming Pennsylvania oil field.The advent of hydraulic fracturing in the 1950's caused explosive stimulation of petroleum wells to decline dramatically The many problems associated with nitro blasting, such as safety and the limitations to working in open holes, caused the decline in the use of nitro shooting However, there is a requirement for this type of stimulation, as evidenced by the extensive interest expressed in Gasbuggy and other major nuclear-stimulation programs for certain formations.Recent research work done in West Virginia and West Texas indicates that hydraulic fracturing, though an excellent method of stimulating wells, is limited to propagating a fracture only along the plane of weakness In some types of rocks.

This paper describes the procedure and the tools Involved Results of the use of the procedure on four wells are discussed and the advantages determined so far are listed. Some possible additional advantages to be derived In the future are also listed.INTRODUCTIONA drilling procedure utilizing proved concepts and tools has been developed by Cities Service Oil Company to improve the drilling and reduce the costs of deep, deviated wells in Corpus Christ Bay. This procedure resulted when considerable experience in drilling wells in this area indicated that insufficient current information was being received from the bottom of the hole Additional information was needed to determine which factors could be improved to reduce drilling costs.Previous work in deviated and S -shaped holes led to the idea that control of bit weight was important but extremely difficult to maintain because of wall friction Consider the footage of drill pipe lying on one side or the other of a deviated hole and visualize the difficulty of controlling the weight on the bit from a measurement of hook load 12,000 ft distant. The length of the drill string is also changing as it rotates because of drag and torque above the deviated hole section and because of the necessity of conforming with these irregularities. This change in length of the drill string results in constant changes in the bit weight Inability to maintain bit weight was demonstrated during an attempt to drill in a deviated hole with a turbine engine driving the bit During 2 days of trial, not 1 ft of hole was cut Because of the inability to control bit weight, the turbine was either spinning harmlessly off bottom or was stalled out on bottom as the result of excess weight.We are interested in securing the most information possible from a well bore at the lowest possible cost. Improved knowledge of when bit teeth or bearings are falling would permit maximum time on bottom, leading to increased footage per bit and therefore lower drilling costs A known fixed weight on the bit, in addition to knowledge of other factors influencing bit life, is necessary to evaluate bottom-hole performance Fig 1 shows a portion of the rate-of-penetration log showing the effect of a dull bit when replaced with a new bit.(The Fig 1 is available in full paper) In an effort to reduce the effect of the constantly changing length of the drill string, a drilling bumper sub (illustrated in Fig 2) was installed in the drill-collar section of the drill string to permit the upper portion of the drill pipe to change dimension with as little effect as possible on the drill collars and bit below the sub.The amount of weight on the bits the sum of two factors One is the weight in mud of the drill string (The Fig 2 is available in full paper) below the drilling sub. The second factor is the result of the hydraulic unbalance inherent in this sub.",,American Petroleum Institute

Optimized drilling, which was first applied on a comprehensive basis in 1967, has significantly reduced drilling costs, although it has yet to reach its full potential. Optimized drilling is defined as the mathematical treatment of the most important controllable drilling variables to develop a comprehensive minimum-cost drilling program The variables involved in rotary drilling are classified as alterable or unalterable, and the variables selected for mathematical optimization are herein described A more detailed treatment will be given to the most important variables optimized - mud, hydraulics, bits, weight, and rotary speed Rig selection and data acquisition are also discussed since these factors play an important role in optimization. The paper includes data which show significant reductions in drilling costs have been obtained when programs were effectively implemented. An interesting aspect of the data presented is that savings achieved in second-round optimums were and, one case, more than those savings obtained in first-round optimums. This indicates that better data, more experience in applying optimized drilling principles, and developing confidence in the program are key factors in successful use of this new drilling approach.INTRODUCTIONThe development of rotary drilling can be divided into four distinct periods Conception Period - 1900- 1920, Development Period - 1920-1 948, Scientific Period - 1948-1968, and Automation Period, which began in 1968. The major accomplishments of the first three periods, and a prediction of what lies in the future for the Automation Period, are shown in Table 1.In reviewing these development periods, the question naturally arises as to the reason for the approximate 30-year lapse between the end of the Conception Period and the start of the Scientific Period. There are a number of reasons that can be given, but undoubtedly the most significant is that major oil-field equipment firms, mud-service companies, and operators did not start appropriating the large amounts of money it takes to do high-quality drilling research until about 1948. When we look at the major accomplishments obtained during the Scientific Period, the most productive years are found to be from 1958 to 1968 A measure of the impact of the drilling technology developed during the latter part of the Scientific Period on holemaking costs, as compared to total well costs, can be seen from Fig 1.Total well costs increased 14 percent from 1958 through 1967 while holemaking costs remained at the 1958 level, Le., about $4 25/ft1Other costs such as completion, logging, and casing expenditures increased 21 percent. If the extensive drilling-research effort of the past 10 years had not been undertaken and had not been successfully reduced to practice in routine drilling operations, it is estimated that a typical 8,000- to 9,000-ft hole would cost an additional $3/ft to drill today. This would amount to a saving of about $500 million for 1967 alone, which is testimony that the investment in drilling research undertaken by many companies has paid off.",,American Petroleum Institute

The control equipment and instrumentation is arranged for complete automatic control by set-points from the remote system dispatcher and provides failsafe reliable operation. The service record of this facility has confirmed the capabilities of this advance design and has proved the safety, economics, flexibility, and performance of the equipment and controls.INTRODUCTIONThe concept of developing partially depleted natural gas fields located near major market areas, into underground storage facilities is recognized as one of the most significant factors in the growth of the large gas-transmission systems By utilizing such facilities, it is possible to operate the main-line portion of the transmission system near 100-percent load factor at all times During summer months, future sales gas a transported to near-market storage facilities and this gas fills the gap between off-peak sales and main-line capacity. During winter months, the storage gas is readily available for high delivery rates to the market, in addition to the normal supply capabilities of the main-line system This technique not only utilizes full pipeline facility investment, but also increases service flexibility and reliability.Texas Eastern has utilized this underground storage concept since 1951 and, like other large transmission companies, it has continued to make storage service an integral part of its system planning and operation.In 1962, shortly after the acquisition of Accident Field properties in Garrett County, Maryland, it was decided to develop this high-pressure field into a storage facility and to enhance the flexibility and operation by designing the equipment to be operated unattended as a remote automatic facility.FIELD DESCRIPTIONAccident Field has a total area of 34,000 acres and was discovered by the firm of Snee and Eberly in 1953.At the time of purchase by Texas Eastern, in June 1962, the field reserves were estimated at 37 7 Bcf The principal gas formations, now the storage formations, are the Hunterville chert and Oriskany sand of the Devonian series at an average local depth of 7,350 ft (Fig 1).The original 18 producing wells have been reworked for storage service, 35 additional have been drilled to date, and it is planned to increase the number of wells to 83 for the full development of the field in the reworking and drilling of these wells, hydrofracturing techniques are used to increase the deliverability of the formation.The total reservoir capacity of the field is estimated to be 63 5 Bcf, and current planning for the field has set 38 3 Bcf capacity for base gas and 25 2 Bcf for top storage gas Original formation pressure was approximately 3,250 psig and this is also the peak shut-in pressure for storage operation Coned injection pressures are slightly higher, depending upon injection rate Maximum deliverability of the field at present is designed for approximately 300 MMcf/D.FIELD PIPING SYSTEMBecause the experience of the existing wells and the geology indicated that the better storage wells would lie on two ridges either side of the field, the field piping system was designed in an H shape (Fig 2) This scheme consists essentially of headers along each flank, with all of the well gathering l",,American Petroleum Institute

The areas to be discussed are: sealed bearing bits, sintered-carbide bits for drilling softer formations, bottom-hole jet bits and mud-motor bits, which are used with the Dyna-Drill and turbine-type down-hole mud motors. There are other areas of note, although the greatest gains are anticipated in the four general categories mentioned. Significant additional improvements will be developed in these areas within the next 2 years. Each year sealed-bearing bits are averaging longer hours on bottom. Some of the reasons for this continued increase in average running hours are: Improved bearing designs - such as the friction bearing, better seals, lubricants, improved carbide grades, extended insert head designs, and hardmetal improvements, to mention a few. Of the four areas to be discussed, use of tungsten carbide bits, with extended, sintered carbide cutting elements, has grown rapidly the past year. The ability of these bits to drill economically in medium to medium hard formations is of the utmost importance. Bottom hole jet bits and mud-motor bits have just recently become more important. Recent tests, using 2-cone bits with bottom-hole jets in conjunction with down-hole mud motors, indicate a reduction in the cost per foot when drilling soft to medium formations.INTRODUCTION.When drilling specific rock types, the basic design concept principles of 3-cone rotary drill bits in recent years has remained relatively constant with no significant changes. Examples are: Fig. 1 - offset, Fig. 2 - journal angle, and Fig. 3 - cone angles, etc.New applications, developments, and improvements utilizing the same design principles are changing some of the old concepts, creating many new and interesting trends. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these new areas, applications, developments, and improvements. The four design areas covered did not in all cases necessarily improve because of bit development. For example, most design developments improved in steps. Sometimes the breakthrough or advance resulted from other related support equipment such as drill pipe, new mud pumps, circulation material, etc. There are drilling tools which, in the past, have seen limited use because of the fact the right idea or application took time in developing. Replacement of roller bearings with friction bearings in rotary rock bits has seen limited success until recently, due to improved seals. Tungsten carbide bits in the past have been used, generally, to drill only hard formations. Design changes following the same general concept of milled tooth designs are now using tungsten carbide bits to drill even softer rock. Bottom-hole jets will be utilized more, as recent tests indicate their usefulness in conjunction with down-hole mud motors. Mud-motor bits or rotary bits, modified in recent years to resist the skidding and abrasion wear created when used with high-speed down-hole motors, are being improved and will be more widely used.",,American Petroleum Institute

An increasing number of expensive abnormal-pressure wells are being drilled below 13,000 ft in search of reserves in south Louisiana Fast drilling is the most direct and effective method that contractors and operators can use to reduce costs At these deeper depths, the diamond bit becomes an economical tool because of its longer life with satisfactory penetration rates Further reduction in drilling costs can be made by improved engineering design and application of diamond bits This paper discusses1, Factors affecting the performance of diamond bits,2,, engineering the proper bit selection,3,, summary of performance of diamond bits for 1967 and 1968 in Humble's Lafayette district,4,, economic incentives.FACTORS AFFECTING THE PERFORMANCE OF DIAMOND BITSDiamond bits differ from roller-type bits in drilling mechanism They remove formation by cutting, scraping, or plowing action The diamond bit is a solid tool with no- moving parts, and the entire cutting face is in contact with the formation when drilling. The face or crown consists of many diamonds molded into a tungsten carbide matrix provided with fluid courses to direct the flow of the drilling fluidHydraulicsBecause of the high heat generated as the diamonds drill, it is necessary to convey heat away from the diamond before it reaches critical limits. This fact makes face velocity of the fluid a critical design factor for the manufacturer Each manufacturer has established a minimum water-course velocity required to provide the necessary cross flow to keep the bit cool and clean without excessive erosion of the matrix Good bottom hole scavenging is a function of velocity Pressure drop across the bit face is the field control of hydraulics The hydraulics we find necessary for good bit performance will satisfy the minimum velocity requirements.Rotary SpeedRotary speed is another contributing factor to bit penetration Test data indicate that, with perfect hole cleaning, the penetration rate of diamond bits is almost in direct proportion to rotary speed High revolutions per minute do not burn a diamond if proper hydraulics are available to cool the diamonds and keep the cuttings removed Bit WeightIn order to achieve penetration of the diamond into the formation, weight of the proper amount must be applied With sufficient hydraulics to clean the bit, penetration rate increases directly with bit weight Drilling should be done with maximum bit weight compatible with available hydraulics Mud WeightMud weight should be kept to a minimum Recently there has been considerable testing done to determine how over-balance affects drilling rate It was found that rock strength is increased as the amount of over-balance is increased. By increasing the pressure differential, it was found that the mode of failure changed from brittle to plastic, slowed down drilling rate, and made hole cleaning more difficult Considerable improvement in drilling rate can be achieved as over-balance is reduced below 500 psl1,2",,American Petroleum Institute

Barite plugs should be mixed with cementing equipment and spotted through the drill pipe, proximate to the active zone, using modern dropping-a-plug techniques as soon as the well becomes active Enough slurry should be used to fill a minimum of 200 - 450 ft of hole The pipe must be withdrawn from the plug immediately to prevent sticking caused by the dehydration or settling of barite around it.INTRODUCTIONIf an over-pressured active zone is encountered during drilling, the mud weight is built up to the point where it controls the luck. This is a straightforward, not overly dangerous procedure However, many times after a kick has occurred, a situation arises where the well is kicking and losing circulation simultaneously. It is extremely dangerous to carry out any operation with a well in this condition Obviously, if a seal could be placed in the wellbore between the active and lost-circulation zones, then returns could be regained in relative safety Barite plugs have been found to be an effective means of obtaining such a seal.A barite p lug is a slurry mixed using barite, a complex phosphate thinner, and water It is spotted through the drill pipe proximate to an active zone Upon being placed, the slurry dehydrates or the barite settles to form a solid plug of barite in the open hole, thereby sealing off the active zone.Actual field applications show that barite plugs will control active gas zones while regaining circulation when searching for the transition zone,** or while making trips These plugs have not been effective in controlling salt-water flows. indicating that enough plug to hydrostatically hll such zones may be needed.Experimental WorkFor forming the test slurries, four barites designated A, B, C, and D, were used together with four thinners sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP), tetrasodium pyropliosphate (TSPP), sodium metaphosphate (SMP), and an organic phosphate-sodium tri-phosphonate [Na5HN(CH2PO3)3]Barite slurries weighing 18 Ib/gal and 23 Ib/gal were prepared by adding barite to the water containing the thinner in 5 sec while stirring at the low speed using a Waring Blendor This was followed by stirring 15 sec at high speed. Because of the large number of tests involved, the optimum pH and phosphate concentration were determined using Barite B, the others were spotchecked. In sea-water systems.

Various acids are disposed of, such as sulfuric and hydrochloric. Basic solutions, both concentrated and diluted - such as calcium, magnesium, and sodium hydroxide - have been successfully injected into subsurface strata as well as many other types of waste effluentsWell depths in the various geologic-physiographic provinces in the United States range from 300 ft to over 12,000 ft in depth However, most wells are less than 4,000 ft deep These wells were drilled to suitable subsurface strata, and completed generally in a more thorough manner than a production well Filtration systems, storage facilities, and pumps were installed and tested before disposal operations were initiated.",,American Petroleum Institute

Klementich(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-69-175,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1969,"Nearly all current self-contained platform drilling rigs are designed for deep drilling. Consequently, these rigs are large, heavy, and costly. Also, large, expensive, supporting structures are required. For the development of shallow fields (less than 10,000 ft), the use of such rigs and platforms will not yield a maximum profit In this paper the physical characteristics and economics of four different rigs - encompassing a wide range in size, weight, price, and performance - are discussed. The largest of these is the current conventional rig, and the smallest is a high-capacity work over rig extended to drilling operations. The intermediate-size rigs are of a new design which utilizes the recent advances in power generation and control, derrick design, and high-speed lightweight mud pumps. For each rig, performance curves were developed and total development-drilling costs were calculated for several model fields. In addition platform costs for various water depths, for each rig were developed. Savings over that obtained with a conventional drilling rig - platform system was thus determined.INTRODUCTIONNearly all of the approximately 45 self-contained platform drilling rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast were designed for deep drilling. These rigs have an average depth rating of 17,500 ft.1Yet industry wise, the average depth of development wells drilled by these rigs in 1967 was only 10,500 ft deep.2In addition, approximately 25 percent of the platform rigs have a depth rating of 15.000 ft or greater, but only 5.7 percent of the wells were drilled beyond this depth. Moreover, 40 percent of the wells drilled were less than 10,000 ft deep. The efficiency of this system for a large percentage of development drilling can therefore be questioned, not only because these rigs are excessively large and costly to operate, but also because large and expensive platform are required for their support.Consequently, for the development of shallow fields (less than 10,000 ft), the use of the present conventional large rig and platform probably does not yield maximum profit. Therefore, a study was initiated by Shell Oil Company to determine the optimum development drilling system. The first phase of the study and this paper were confined to self-contained platform rigs. Because:1, self-contained platform rigs probably represent the optimum system;2, sufficient accurate information on these type systems is available; and3, rig equipment of various size and weight, with a wide range in performance and price, is readily available so that an optimum self-contained platform rig could readily be built if required.RIG DESCRIPTIONSBecause offshore economics and operating conditions dictate more versatile rig capabilities than onshore, the search for an optimum-size rig was confined basic types. In this paper these rigs shall be called Types 20, 14, 10, and 8, referring to their approximate depth rating in thousands of feet.

Within 1 year, the plant design was changed, and 5 electric-motor-driven pumps were replaced with one 1,100-lip gas-turbine-centrifugal pump unit Economics were attractive, with plans to utilize surplus fuel gas and to incorporate existing equipment into other injection projects initial concern for having a large-scale system dependent upon a single pump has been reduced with 18 months of satisfactory performance at rates over 70,000 BWlPD at 500 psig. The only Persistent engine problem was a unique carbon-building characteristic. The operator and manufactures are currently evaluating a Prototype combustor section which was installed to eliminate this problem Some period failures of electronic control components also have been corrected by modification and replacements The high-speed centrifugal pump has been trouble-freeAs a result of the operator's successful experience to date, a second turbine installation is being considered for the expansion of another pressure-maintenance system in south Oregon Basin.OREGAN BASIN ACCELARATION PROGRAMIn 1966, the unit operator outlined plans for an extensive program to increase production of asphalt-base crude from 6 reservoirs in the Oregon Basin Field The North Dome was selected for initial work because of higher productivity and greater potentla1 for additional development.Pressure maintenance to prevent expansion of secondary gas caps has always been a controlling factor in exploitation of the Phosphoria and Tensleep reservoirs Thus, the basic consideration was to expand peripheral water injection before withdrawals were increased. Under the proposed schedule, reservoir pressure would actually be stimulated in the face of a several-fold increase in withdrawals from a 12-well drilling program and the installation of 60 high-volume pumps. Pressure maintenance is limited to the Phosphoria and Tensleep reservoirs, which currently have 14 dually completed wells injecting into the aquifer at the water- oil contact. Before acceleration, oil and water production from these two reservoirs was 10,500 BOPD and 13,000 BWPD. Injection was being maintained at 26,000 BWIPD for a positive replacement. To match expected withdrawals, the injection system was redesigned for a capacity of 100,000 BWIPD at maximum pressures of 1,500 psig. This radical enlargement appears to have been justified, for in only 2 years production increased to 20,000 BOPD and 40,000 BWPD ( Fig 1).",,American Petroleum Institute

Hale(Texas A and M University),,,,,,API-70-001,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"In a sucker-rod pumping system, an accurate prediction of peak and minimum polished-rod loads is necessary for the economical selection and application of the prime mover, surface pumping unit, and rod string. For many years it has been noted that, although peak polished-rod loads are generally predicted with acceptable accuracy, predicted minimum polished-rod loads are often substantially higher than measured values. This discrepancy can be partially accounted for by the rod-coupling- piston effect which tends to retard falling rods. Recent studies have shown that-the retarding force caused by the rod-coupling-piston effect can be calculated with some precision, making predicted minimum polished-rod loads more realistic. Additionally, when large-diameter pumps and sucker rods are used with relatively small-diameter tubing, the increase in peak polished-rod load resulting from the rod-coupling - piston effect may also be significant.INTRODUCTIONAccurately predicting torsional and structural loads imposed on a surface pumping unit, under a given set of conditions, is one of the more important aspects of economically producing the well. From the beginning of the petroleum industry up to the mid-1950's, a basic and somewhat primitive method of predicting well loads was determined by a set of simple equations which considered the weight of the rods, weight of the fluid, and the inertial forces to which these quantities were subjected. Because early-day wells were relatively shallow and pumping loads reasonably light, rod and fluid loads behaved much like a concentrated mass acting at the polished rod. Primarily because of this fact, these simplified prediction formulas generally produced acceptable results.As rod strings became longer and fluid loads heavier, rod loads could no longer be considered a concentrated polished-rod weight, magnified by a simple impulse factor and added to the fluid load, but had to be handled as a highly complex elastic mass vibrating at some natural frequency, reciprocated with modified harmonic motion, and acted upon by other external forces.In the mid-1950's a group of operators and manufacturers of sucker-rod pumping equipment organized the Sucker-rod Institute (SRI) to develop - among other things - a more sophisticated and accurate method of predicting torsional and structural pumping-unit loads. The work of the Sucker-rod Research Institute in developing this formulation -which considered such variables as harmonic rod forces, friction, damping factors, pumping-unit geometry, etc. - resulted in a set of rigorous prediction equations which has been quite successful in applying sucker-rod pumping systems in an economical and effective manner. In recent years much of these data have been incorporated into current API standards.In the early 1960's, Dr. S. G. Gibbs of Shell Oil Company's R D section, developed a diagnostic technique which further refined the procedure for optimum application of pumping units; and his paper, Predicting the Behavior of Sucker-rod Pumping Systems has made a significant contribution to the science of artificial lift. The advent of the modern computer has accelerated the solution of this complex formulation, and much work is currently being done in the petroleum industry in the utilization of these advanced methods of unit application.However, even with the advent of these improved techniques, unusual discrepancies between predicted and measured loads were often noted and a reasonable explanation for this peculiar sucker-rod behavior was sought.Among perhaps others, L. D. Patton, Lufkin Foundry Machine Company, noted in the study of several hundred pumping wells that, in many cases, a substantial difference existed between predicted and measured peak polished ?rod loads, as well as between predicted and measured minimum polished-rod loads regardless of the prediction method used ? primitive or sophisticated",,American Petroleum Institute

Hoch(Phillips Petroluem Co.),,,,,,API-70-027,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"The principles of obtaining successful primary-cement jobs have been available for years. These include centralization, scratchers, pipe reciprocation, turbulent flow conditions, large-volumewashes, minimum practical mud density and viscosity, non-varnished (or coated) pipe, and cement type.1,2,4,9,11 HOW and which of these principles are to be applied to achieve a successful job should be determined for each field. This paper describes the techniques, materials, and equipment used in obtaining successful single-stage primary cement jobs with 3,000-ft to 5,000-ft cement columns in difficult high-angle (63 &frac12; deg) S -type directional wells. Bond-log analysis was used to determine the differences between successful and unsuccessful primary cement jobs. This also revealed a dramatic difference in the bonding results where scratchers and pipe reciprocation were used, as compared to non-scratched jobs.INTRODUCTIONSome operators are reluctant to use scratchers, pipe reciprocation, turbulent-flow conditions, and washes longer than several hundred feet of annular space, because many successful primary cement jobs have resulted using only centralizers, existing mud properties, low annular velocities, and with the type of cement popular in the area. Also, use of scratchers, pipe reciprocation, and turbulent flow to remove mud filter cake can increase the hazards of sticking the casing and cement dehydration. The decision whether or not to use scratchers and pipe reciprocation then becomes a choice of1obtaining a primary cement job having low risk of cement failure, using equipment, materials, and techniques to minimize possible sticking and cement dehydration; or2accepting a primary cement job having a much-higher risk of cement failure, but less possibility of pipe sticking and dehydration.The application of scratchers and pipe reciprocation has not been the general practice in most California offshore fields for these and other reasons, given following.Floating Vessel OperationsMost ocean-floor well heads have utilized mandrel-type casing hangers. Should the production casing stick during running or reciprocation with scratchers, a difficult pipe-cutting and slip-installation job would result. Also, continuous vessel movement, coupled with the rig drive limitations, imposes the difficulty of limiting the hook load to less than pipe strength during reciprocation. Platform OperationsIn the past, casing strings using the less-efficient API 8-round-thread joints have parted at shallow dog-legs in high-angle directional wells while running, reciprocating, or cementing the pipe. In many wells the maximum casing and frictional hook load, which imposed the maximum pipe bending stresses (at the dog-legs), occurred during the upstroke as or after the cement started around the shoe.DESCRIPTION OF A TYPICAL, S -TYPE WELLDrilling and Casing - Hole-size ProgramPhillips Petroleum Company, as operator for the Continental-Cities Service-Phillips California Of shore Group, drilled 63 directional ( S -curved) wells from Platforms Hogan and Houchin in the offshore Carpinteria Field.

This technology has been utilized by NACE and API committees in the development of recommendations and specifications. TheNACE TI F166recommendations for valves for sour service and the API C-75 specifications for casing and tubing are widely accepted and used documents. These recommendations and specifications are considered adequate for most sour-service applications. The safety record established during the past 15 years of sour gas production is commendable. The key to this successful safe operation of sour service equipment and facilities has been the use of up-to-date technology and carefully chosen and inspected materials. Details of the background information used by the NACE committees during the development of their recommendations are presented.INTRODUCTIONThe sour gas industry was born during the early 1950's as a result of the discovery of large sour gas reserves in Western Canada. As usual when man faces an unknown situation, considerable concern was felt regarding the capabilities of the industry to provide facilities which would withstand the sour gas environment. Much of this concern was based on early field experience which had demonstrated that metallic materials often failed rapidly when exposed to sour gas. Research was initiated by the industry and universities to develop the technology required to safely and economically produce the newly found reserves.The petroleum and supply industries have accepted the technology as it became available from the research organizations. During the late 1950's, the Canadian petroleum industry saw the need to standardize the requirements on an industry-wide basis so that items suitable for the sour gas environment could be purchased at a reasonable cost and with minimum delay in delivery. As a result, representatives from several Canadian companies formed a task force to develop recommendations for sour gas equipment. This group later became affiliated with the NACE and became known as the T-1B Unit Committee on Corrosion in Oil and Gas Well Equipment. The results of the effort of this committee were published as a committee report in 1963.1This report supplied a large portion of the data and recommendations included in theNACE Publication IF166entitledSulfide Cracking Resistant Metallic Materials for Valves for Production and Pipeline Service.2This publication has had world-wide acceptance and is often used for applications other than valves. Concurrently,API Std 5ACwas developed for C-75 casing and tubing. The API has also included a reference toNACE IF166,/i&gt; inAPI Std 6Afor valves and wellhead equipment.Past ExperienceThe safety record established during the past 15 years of sour gas production has been commendable. This record can be largely attributed to prudent selection, quality control, and inspection of materials. Quality control and inspection should be considered as important, if not more important than material selection. Materials which meet the requirements set forth inNACE IF166have given excellent service. The equipment failures which have occurred have been largely attributed to use of metallic materials which did not conform to the standards established for sour gas environments.",,American Petroleum Institute

The method of data gathering and analysis of the information gathered with approximately 2,000 ft of protection are discussed, and some typical field applications are presented. During 3 years of active offshore drilling operations, no adverse conditions have resulted from the utilization of this technique for estimating fracture gradients.INTRODUCTIONOne important factor in efficiently planning the drilling of wells is having an overbalanced drilling fluid to contain formation pressures that will be encountered. The density of the drilling fluid must be specified such that no loss of circulation occurs as a result of hydraulically fracturing the formation. Much research has been done pertaining to hydraulic fracturing in well bores, with the work published by Hubbert and Willis in 19571providing the basic theoretical background. Many subsequent reports have dealt with this subject and have broadened this theoretical approach. Yet, within the derived equations, certain parameters remain poorly known from one geographical location to another. The expense of operating offshore requires constant reevaluation of the phases of the operation to reduce unjustified cost. In the past, casing and mud programs have been designed to specifications set forth by theory and data gathered in areas other than offshore Louisiana. To define the existing parameters in the present area of operation, a program of accurate measurement of fracture propagation gradients was initiated. The information was obtained while abandoning expendable tests. With actual measured values in fields that are large enough to justify platform development, these data allow more efficient casing and mud programs. This type of planning contributes to safer drilling operations. When the maximum mud weight to be contained is known, a casing depth can be selected with a sufficient safety factor; or, for exploratory drilling, the maximum allowable mud weight can be specified for a given depth of protection. This type of information can significantly decrease the occurrence of lost circulation and result in safer operations and better well control. Incidental to increased safety, some circumstances allow better casing designs with significant saving in capital. This paper presents field data, the method of obtaining the information, and its relation to existing theory on hydraulic fracturing in the northern Gulf basin.THEORYA mathematical model to describe hydraulic fracturing in an open well bore can be constructed by analyzing stresses near the well bore. Such a model requires the following assumptionsExposed formations are isotropic, homogeneous, porous, and linearly elastic.Conditions a t the well bore govern fracturing.The well bore is parallel to one of the principal tectonic stresses.Fracturing occurs when effective stress tangential to the well bore is equal to or larger than the tensile strength of the formation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Div of Halliburton Company.),,,,,,API-70-051,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"Through the years, hydraulic fracturing has been one of the most successful production-stimulation techniques used. The success of fracturing is believed to be primarily a function of the depth of penetration of a high capacity propped fracture system. Longer and wider fractures demand that proppants be transported not only greater distances, but also in greater quantities. These demands are usually limited by the viscosity, friction, and fluid-loss characteristics of the fracturing fluid.A new and unique type of fracturing fluid has been developed, which is a highly VISCOUS non-Newtonian water-base gel capable of suspending high concentrations of large proppants. Because of the viscous nature and non-Newtonian characteristics of this gel, lower fluid loss and lower friction pressures are observed than with viscous Newtonian fluids.Advantages of high-viscosity fracturing fluids will he discussed and comparisons made to illustrate the effect of viscosity changes. In addition, properties of this new high-viscosity gel, field applications and results of specific treatments will be given.INTRODUCTIONSince the inception of hydraulic fracturing, many fluids have been used to place proppants in created fractures. Fracturing fluids that have been used over the years include crude oils, gelled crude oils, emulsions, refined oils, water-base gels, and water. It has been generally accepted that the requirements of a good fracturing fluid are :1Capable of supporting and placing propping agents into the created fracture.Have low fluid loss to the formation matrix.Produce low pumping-friction losses in the tubing or casing.Have a minimum damaging effect on the formation.Capable of being removed from the fracture for easy clean-up.Easily applied in field operations.In recent years, there has been a trend toward more viscous fracturing fluids because of the advantages they offer. High-viscosity low-fluid-loss fracturing fluids produce greater fluid pressure drop within the fracture, which offers not only the opportunity to increase the width of the fracture, but also the created vertical fracture height.' This may allow more complete treatment of thick intervals. In addition, with these fluids, higher concentrations of larger proppants are placed at greater depths and a t lower pumping rates than with conventional fluids.In the following sections of this paper, comparisons are made to illustrate the effect of fluid viscosity on fracture geometry and production increase. The properties of a new high-viscosity gel will be discussed, along with field applications and specific fracturing treatments.RELATIONSHIP RETWEEN FRACTURE GEOMICTIRY AND FLUID VISCOSITYSuccess of any hydraulic fracturing treatment is dependent upon many variables, but the fracturing fluid itself plays a primary role in determining the production increase following stimulation. The fracturing fluid must be capable of placing propping agents in the created fracture so that, after the pressure release, the fracture remains open forming a fracture conductivity exceeding the conductivity of the formation. Generally, it has been stated that the production increase following a fracturing stimulation depends largely upon the created fracture flow capacity, as well as the propped-fracture length3,4",,American Petroleum Institute

Clare(Sun Oil Company),,,,,,API-70-058,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"In cooperation with Sun Oil Company, the Bureau of Mines investigated the application of chemical explosive fracturing for stimulating natural-gas recovery. Two tests conducted in the shallow Buzzard sand formation in Osage County. Oklahoma, demonstrated that desensitized nitroglycerin can be safely loaded, displaced, and detonated in hydraulically induced fractures both in open-hole intervals and through casing perforations. Stimulation was evaluated from results of impression packers, temperature and down-hole camera surveys, and flow tests. The well completed in open hole responded poorly. probably because static fluid conditions were difficult to establish before explosive fracturing and an extended cleanout period was required after fracturing. A 40-percent improvement in flow capacity was effected in the well completed through casing perforations. Casing damage occurred only in the joint in the perforated intervals, ant1 no remedial work was required before the well was placed on production.INTRODUCTIONThe petroleum industry and government agencies are developing stimulation techniques to improve recovery from low-permeability oil and gas reservoirs. Recoveries have been increased from tight formations that contain vast petroleum reserves previously unrecoverable. Hydraulic fracturing, acidizing, and chemical and thermal application have contributed significantly to improved recovery, but some formations have not responded to these techniques.The Bureau of Mines is investigating the application of explosives in tight petroleum formations to improve permeability by extending the existing fracture system and creating a secondary system of fractures. A liquid explosive is displaced into an induced fracture and detonated. The energy of the detonation is liberated deep within the formation. This method differs from conventional well-bore shooting, which affects only the well bore and adjacent formation rock near the charge.One oil-field service company1advocates that this treatment be applied before a hydraulic-fracturing treatment. They contend that an explosive detonation within a well bore relieves the principal stresses in the surrounding rock and allows the hydraulic-fracturing treatment to open new drainage channels that are impossible to open by only conventional stimulation.Results of an explosive treatment in a West Virginia gas well were recently reported.2Multiple treatments of a new high-yield, non-nuclear explosive were applied. The explosive and methods used reportedly can be tailored to meet individual well characteristics, and the energy release can be controlled for maximum formation fracturing. Productivity of this particular gas well increased from 3,000 to 5,000 Mcf/D, before and after treatment. A second test, reportedly the largest underground chemical explosion east of the Mississippi River, was conducted in a 5,100-ft well near Magnolia, Ohio, using 35,000 lb of explosive. Results of the test are being evaluated.A patent4describes an explosive-fracturing technique very similar to the one tested in this research. An explosive slurry was displaced through tubing into existing fractures in the formation before detonation. No results of that application have been reported. Probably the two most spectacular explosive-fracturing applications are the much-publicized Project Gas-buggy in New Mexico and Project Rulisons in Colorado; both are nuclear explosions.",,American Petroleum Institute
788,321321,,The use of Polished-bore Receptacles in Deep Gas Wells,H.E. Lindsey Jr.(MWL Tool and Supply Co. Midland. Texas),,,,,,API-70-082,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"Over 60 wells have been completed using a new concept in well-completion equipment in ultra-deep gas wells in the West Texas Delaware Basin and the Anadarko Basin of the Texas Panhandle. This concept requires setting a special tubing seal assembly into a long polished-bore receptacle which has been cemented as a part of the production casing string. This method of completion has apparently eliminated or greatly reduced the problem of casing pressure buildups caused by tubing or bottom-hole equipment leakage in deep, high-pressure gas wells. When the special tubing seal assembly is spaced according to precise tubing elongation and contraction calculations, it will not be subjected to movement and wear during the productive life of the well. This paper discusses typical casing programs, earlier completion methods and their problems, various mechanical hookups now used by different operators, and -particularly- the advantages offered by this new concept. Drawings are included which illustrate typical completion installations now in use for single and dual gas wells.INTRODUCTIONSeveral papers and articles published by various industry associations and magazines have outlined the numerous problems encountered when completing ultra-deep gas wells. Some are those of tubing-casing annulus pressure buildups from leakage in the completion equipment. This leakage is often an incidence of equipment malfunction.In the fall of 1968, a new completion method was used in a Ward County, Texas well. It featured the use of a long polished-bore receptacle cemented in the top of the production liner. The tubing was then landed and sealed in the receptacle. This method seemed to incorporate all the benefits required for tubing lengthening and shortening, while providing a satisfactory seal during productive life of the well.Since this first installation, more than 60 deep wells have been completed with these long polished-bore receptacles installed as the primary sealing means for production and stimulation. In all cases they have been successful installations, from a mechanical standpoint -at least no reports of leakage between the tubing seal nipple assembly and the receptacle have been reported. These production receptacles may be installed in any one of these positions:Top of the production liner hanger.Top of the tie-back or secondary production liner.Crossover point in the liner tie-back string.Crossover point in a full combination casing string.At more than one position for dual or multiple completions.TYPICAI, CASING PROGRAMSA typical casing program in deep wells usually calls for 30-in. conductor, then 20-in. surface casing through surface waters and unconsolidated formations; 13 3/8-in. casing is then run as a secondary surface string to permit isolation of shallow lost-return zones, close off salt sections, and permit effective support of mud weights required to reach planned intermediate casing depth.

Therefore, ignorance is the principal reason for failure of unit plans. This hurdle can be overcome by educational work to sell the unit. The key to success in this regard is to treat all parties as intelligent individuals, to invite then1 to take part in the negotiations from their inception, and to acknowledge that minor interests have their own peculiar problems. A willingness to cooperate, frankness, sincerity, and fairness on the part of the major operators are essential ingredients if unitization is to succeed.DISCUSSIONIt is a well-recognized fact that, in most petroleum reservoirs, a relatively small fraction of the oil in place is ultimately recovered when operated by primary methods and in accordance with the rule of capture. In many instances, significant quantities of additional oil could be recovered economically if the pools could be unitized so that property lines could be disregarded to eliminate the element of competition.It has been adequately demonstrated that, for many pools, the reservoir characteristics are such that if they are unitized the ultimate oil recovery can be increased materially by the application of secondary-recovery methods of operation whereby the native reservoir energy content is augmented by the injection of fluids.In view of the obvious benefits which can derive from unitization, the question arises why, in numerous instances, independent operators and royalty owners have refused to join a proposed unit plan. The discussion which follows will be limited to the field-wide type of unit. Spacing units will not be part of this discussion. Such units are those in which small leases are combined to form an area conforming to the established spacing pattern for a field for the purpose of drilling only one well.Independent operators and landowners, as a general rule, do not recognize the benefits which can be derived from unitization. For the most part, this is because of an almost complete lack of understanding on their part of the fundamentals involved. They simply do not understand the purposes of the agreement and the effect it will have on them. Therefore, the principal reason why unit plans fall is ignorance. It requires a great deal of educational work to overcome this hurdle. Perhaps one of the best ways to achieve this is for all operators and royalty owners to take part in the unitization negotiations from the inception and to be kept fully informed at all times of the proceedings. When many small ownerships are involved, this presents the problem of technical proficiency. Accordingly, small owners should be encouraged to jointly employ a competent oil attorney and an engineering consultant to act as their representatives. The worst possible condition, from the standpoint of effecting a unit is for the major interests to negotiate and then present the small independents and royalty owners with a completed package for their approval. Invariably this leads to the suspicion that the majors have concocted a deal which will benefit them to the detriment of the others. The key to success is to treat all parties as intelligent individuals and to acknowledge that they have their own peculiar problems.

Abel(Amoco Production Co.),,,,,,API-70-092,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"Pan American Petroleum Corporation completed an automation project during the latter part of 1967 to control the production of oil from the East Texas Field from the Tyler office, located about 40 miles from the field. The project applied the techniques of tank-battery consolidation, telemetry, remote data acquisition, and supervisory control. One of the major parts of the project was the consolidation of 93 leases (approximately 915 wells) and 45 outside-operated leases under one automatic custody transfer system, using the company affiliated pipeline's gravity-feed crude gathering system. The other part of the project consisted of a computer interfaced supervisory control system. From the central control in Tyler, lease production is scheduled, controlled, accumulated and formally reported. Also at the central control, operations are maintained under constant surveillance and equipment malfunctions are logged. These malfunctions are then relayed by a system operator to appropriate operating or maintenance personnel by company radio network. The paper discusses, in some detail, the system and how it operates; but primarily emphasis is placed onhowthis company uses the system andwhatis derived from it .It discusses the change in responsibility for production from the pumper in the field to the system operator in the office. Finally, the paper compares actual operating conditions with those predicted at the conception of the project and discusses maintenance problems associated with the operation of the system.INTRODUCTIONPan American Petroleum Corporation's East Texas Field automation project, completed in two phases, was started up and operational in September 1967. The project area covers approximately 55 square miles in the north half of the field. It lies between the cities of Gladewater and Longview and is bounded on the south by the Sabine River as shown in Fig. 1. In this general area, Pan American operated 974 wells located on 101 leases.Oil production in the field is obtained from the Woodbine formation at the depth of approximately 3,300 ft. The field has been producing for about 35 years and has sufficient reserves to sustain production for another 70 years. About 95 percent of the wells in the project area are flowing-pipeline oil wells. The remaining wells produce varying amounts of salt water and production is obtained by subsurface pumping units with electric motor drivers.Top allowable for this field, based on 10-acre spacing and the depth, is 20 B/ D. Scheduled allowable for most wells generally is less, because the average well density is less than 5 acres per well. Field production is also subject to the Texas market demand factors. Characteristically, this producing zone is very prolific. Therefore, any well will produce its scheduled allowable when flowing on a schedule of only 30 to 35 min a day, 3 or 4 days a week.THE AUTOMATION PROJECTA NecessityA study in 1964 revealed that about 15 percent of the storage tanks located throughout this field required extensive repair or replacement at a cost of approximately $ 285,000. The study also revealed the economic feasibility of a project consisting of tank-battery consolidation and modernization and the addition of a computerized supervisory control data and data acquisition system. The long range advantages and economics of the latter were considered far more attractive than spending $ 285,000 to replace the existing equipment. Third Phase of AutomationManagement approval of the project actually was the beginning of the third phase of automation for this old field in the change from manual to automatic operation. As far back as 1995, most leases were automatic ",,American Petroleum Institute

Fulton(Humble Oil and Refining Co.),,,,,,API-70-098,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"This paper describes the design and operation of alarm and data telemetering systems in Illinois Basin fields. The first of these began operation in the Loudon Field in central Illinois in 1967. A second system was completed in 1969, serving 7 of Humble's producing properties in southern Illinois and Kentucky These two installations have demonstrated that alarm and data telemetering can be successfully applied in both large and small fields in the Illinois Basin. Production benefits have resulted and improved operational efficiency has been achieved, permitting adoption of this method for future operations.INTRODUCTIONIn 1967, the Evansville District of Humble Oil Refining Co. began operation of its first alarm and data telemetering system at Loudon Field in central Illinois. During 1969, a second system was completed serving 7 producing properties in southern Illinois and Kentucky. Fig. 1 is a map of the tri-state area, which gives the general location of the properties involved and serves to point out a basic difference between the two systems. Loudon Field, at the top of the map, is a relatively large and compact producing property served by one telemetering system. All alarm and data devices in Loudon are tied by buried telephone cable to a base station centrally located within the field. The seven fields shown at the bottom of the map are small properties for which a telemetering system could not be justified on an individual basis. The fields in southern Illinois and Kentucky are served by the second system and are tied by radio communication to Humble's field office at Carmi, Ill.To be more specific with reference to the relative size of the fields involved, a comparison is shown in Table 1. Humble's Loudon operation has some 894 pumping wells, from which oil is sold through 64 LACT units and 80 conventional tank batteries. Produced water is gathered at 18 sites and pumped to 730 injection wells (Figure 1 and Table are available in full paper)from 14 waterflood plants. Comparison of the Loudon figures with the totals for the fields involved in the southern Illinois and Kentucky system indicates the relative size of the fields and of the telemetering systems designed to monitor them.The Loudon telemetering system serves 3 primary functions:1, monitors operational status of alarm switches in the field;2, monitors oil production through lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) units;3, monitors discharge pressure at waterflood plants. The system provides continuous surveillance of field functions through the use of alarm and data sensing switches installed at critical points throughout the field. Humble installed and maintains all of the alarm and data sensing equipment at Loudon. The remainder of the telemetering system -which includes buried cable, field transmitters, and base station equipment - was installed by the local telephone company. The telephone company maintains this equipment and leases it to Humble.",,American Petroleum Institute

Wilson(Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago Chicago Ill.),,,,,,API-70-181,"Drilling and Production Practice, 1 January, Washington, D.C.",1970,"The 1969 Tax Reform Act will principally affect oil and gas producers through lower percentage depletion, the minimum tax on preference items, and the changes in the tax treatment of production payments. All of these provisions tend to reduce the collateral value of producing properties, but the exact effect of each cannot be evaluated simply. The consequences of this reduction in borrowing power and the loss of flexibility in tax planning are discussed.INTRODUCTIONPublic Law 91-172, also known as the Tax Reform Act of 1969, was signed into law by President Nixon on December 30, 1969. It is a record piece of legislation in a number of respects, but primarily it represents the most drastic overhaul of the internal revenue laws in the history of Thirteenth Amendment. The name Tax Reform Act has been described as an excellent example of inexact labeling; such terms as Christmas Tree Act and The Tax Lawyers' and Accountants' Protective Act have been proposed as being more aptly descriptive of this new legislation.Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Stanley Surrey, must be considered the father of the Tax Reform Act. In the latter part of 1968, it became generally known that the staff of the Treasury Department was preparing an in-depth critique of the internal revenue laws then in effect, along with a large number of recommended changes to tighten exemptions and deductions. Pursuant to the terms of the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 (which provided for the 10-percent surcharge on income taxes along with a 6-billion-dollar cut in federal expenditures), President Johnson was obligated to submit to the Congress proposals for tax reform, presumably those Secretary Surrey and his staff then were completing. On December 31, 1968 President Johnson submitted a letter to Speaker McCormack of the House of Representatives, wherein he declined to submit such proposals, stating that it would be more appropriate for the new administration to consider the whole question of tax reform.The former Secretary of the Treasury, Joseph W. Barr, added a note of urgency to the picture in his now-famous speech, in which he predicted a taxpayers' revolt unless substantial tax reforms were to be adopted. The phrase taxpayers' revolt added just the right amount of fuel to the mix. Tar reform suddenly was a household term and the subject of many emotionally charged editorials, articles, and commentaries - many referring to the so-called loopholes available to the petroleum industry. What happened then is mainly of historical interest. The hearings, the charges and counter charges, that give and take of the political processes in both houses of the Congress, and lo! we have a new set of tax rules affecting practically everyone in this country, one way or another.Much more could be said about the content of this Act, and the haste with which many vitally important sections were considered and acted upon. Only time and the tax courts will settle many new questions that are bound to arise and the process of implementing the changes in the law with specific regulations will defer the solution of many problems for months and perhaps years.",,American Petroleum Institute

The unique environment in this area suggests that new methods be developed for the seismic exploration of the 165 million offshore ice-covered permit acres currently held by the petroleum industry. This paper describes some system concepts that could be applied to a basic multiple-coverage seismic reflection survey in ice-covered waters. Concepts include military or research submarines, free underwater torpedoes, messenger and tethered vehicles, and a cable-on-ice technique which is an adaptation of standard land methods. To meet near-term multiple coverage survey requirements, the cable-on-ice system appears to offer significant overall advantages.The Canadian Arctic area shown in Fig. 1 has been identified as having an enormous petroleum potential possibly greater than that expected on the North Slope area.' This area forms one of the largest remaining unexplored sedimentary geological regions of the world. Although the arctic has been studied over the last decade for its exploitation possibilities by the Canadian government and certain consulting firms, it has only been during the last few years that exploration has begun in earnest. With activity perhaps spurred by the North Slope discovery, expenditure for the search of oil north of Canada's 60th parallel has increased from $5 million in 1958 to $50 million in 1968 and will likely exceed $70 million for 1969(op. cit.). Seismic and gravity crews are becoming more common on the arctic islands themselves, with offshore exploration now being planned. For example, Pallister and Assoclates2 has proposed to the industry a $20 million program to provide basic offshore exploration and exploitation studies in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Several proposals have been made to industry on methods for pursuing an economical seismic survey in ice-covered waters. These include use of a converted fleet submarine and the use of a small towed vehicle. Industry is beginning to study the problems associated with the exploitation of these mineral and petroleum reserves in the marine tracts.INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITYVirtually all of the geologically prospective areas in the Canadian Arctic have been leased by industry, in spite of the arctic environmental problems and ice-covered water depths. Lease acquisition has pushed off the western Island boundaries and onto the polar pack ice. Of the approximately 265 million acres under permit, the largest proportion - some 165 million acres -are marine tracts. Fig. 2 summarizes the deposits required on these permits by the Canadian government. Permits are initially taken for a 6-year term. Deposits, which are refundable on expenditure for development, start at 5 cents per acre and increase to 50 cents per acre after the 10th year. Permits may be dropped at any time. The major offshore-permit holders are identified in Table 1 and control approximately 40 percent of the total area. King Resources has the greatest holdings, with over 30 million acres. The remainder of the marine permits are spread among some 100 other companies.",,American Petroleum Institute

Although American know-how and money are responsible for these reserves, they cannot be considered fully reliable for the future petroleum needs of this country. At the same time, the accumulation of crude reserves in the United States continues to decline annually because of a drastic slow-down in domestic exploration at a time when demand is skyrocketing.The industry?s future is being weakened by this lack of foresight and could lead to serious consequences in the future due to the fact that if domestic reserves continue to diminish in the face of rising demand, the nation will soon find itself acutely short of petroleum and dangerously dependent on foreign sources for its crude requirements.Alarmingly, we are using our domestic reserves of oil and gas faster than we are adding to them. During the early 1950's over a barrel and a half of oil was added to domestic reserves for every barrel of oil produced. Also, approximately 2 cubic feet of gas were found for each cubic foot produced. At the present time, however, the ratio of discovery to production is less than one for both oil and gas (see Fig. 1).Although production has increased sharply since 1965 the capacity to produce has been declining since 1967, and as a result, spare capacity has declined about a million bbls. a day since 1965. As shown by Figure 2 spare capacity will disappear by the middle 1970's. When this happens we will become dependent on foreign oil sources for not only a large and increasing portion of our normal oil supply but for all of any emergency requirements for petroleum.Consequently, when and if our foreign supplies are ever cut off in a period when domestic reserves are insufficient to take care of this nation's industrial and military requirements for an extended period of time, we're going to be in real trouble as a world power and as a nation. Since this country's industrial might and, security depend on our own reliable domestic petroleum reserves, it behooves the petroleum industry to get down to the business of finding large supplies of domestic reserves.Three requisites for this accomplishment must be met:the domestic exploratory effort must be encouraged by government policies ; this has not been the case, since the early 1950's;the exploratory effort must be upgraded in its scientific objectives so that subtle traps as well as structural ones become the objectives, andthe exploratory effort, especially drilling, must be increased tremendously, on a long-term basis, beginning now.I know of no better way to stress the need for an immediately accelerated and increased drilling programs than to present. 3 charts from my 1968 paper on Giant Oil Fields in the United States.",,American Petroleum Institute

I am referring to the growing shortage of adequate supplies of natural gas.It was not so many years ago that natural gas was the unwanted little brother of the petroleum industry. It was a virtually worthless by-product which was flared, or practically given away. In fact, it was only about 50 years ago that natural gas began to be sold for cash money . I am sure there are people in this room who can still remember those beginnings, when this waste product began to be a potential new market and a source of income for the petroleum industry.This previously unwanted industry has grown to a capital investment of $46 billion by the end of last year. More importantly, and of greater significance to you today, is the fact that the number of customers. has increased to a point where over146 millionAmericans are now served by natural gas. The plant investment of the natural gas industry rankssixthamong the industries in the United States. Natural gas provides 113-of our nation's total energy requirements. For example, it accounts for 112 of the energy used in household heating, and approximately 112 of the energy used for industrial power and heating . . . and about 25% of the electricity consumed in the United States is generated with gas as the energy fuel.Therefore, even though the oil industry big brother has grown into a great international industry, and probably one of the most powerful in the world, the little brother, natural gas, although he may still be the unpopular member of the family, has grown large enough to be reckoned with and may cause you trouble far beyond his size.DEMAND FOR ENERGYThe United States has become a great energy sponge, soaking up the world's supplies at rates faster than anyone had ever contemplated. The 20th century has seen energy arrive as a vital necessity of everyday life, exceeded only by food, water, clothing and shelter. We consumed as much energy in the 20th century in the United States as had been consumed in all the world?s previous 2,000 years.It is estimated that in the last four years, energy consumption has increased at almost double the rate of the increase in the Gross National Product. The Department of the Interior estimates that the demand for energy will double again by 1990, and will have tripled by the end of this century, which is now not so far away.DEMAND FOR NATURAL GASNow, this little brother, natural gas, has been growing at an even faster rate. In the, short span of eight years ended in 1968, while the population in this country increased by 11%,t he consumption of natural gas increased by 50%. Today the demands are greater than ever. Natural gas is the clean fuel, it is the ideal fuel in today's environmental controversy.Furthermore, the natural gas industry has developed a transportation system which moves the gas from coast to coast, south to north, in a silent , unseen underground system of pipelines that takes the gas directly from the wellhead right into the kitchen of the housewife. It is indeed a premium fuel, but as you know, it is still carrying bargain basement prices.If natural gas had been priced throughout these past years at a price more in line with its value, perhaps I would not be here today to discuss this problem. However, natural gas prices have been so restricted by federal and local regulation that producers have never developed the economic incentive to search specifically for gas. Most of the gas reserves have been found coincidentally with the search for oil.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-71-223,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 3-5 May, Los Angeles, California",1971,"I appreciate the opportunity to come before you today with such illustrious industry experts as those who have just spoken. My assignment is a simple one -- just tell the petroleum industry where to get nearly 400 billion dollars over the next 10 years to satisfy the requirements of the consuming public for hydrocarbon energy. The apparent reason for calling on me for this capital requirement summation is a paper I gave a year ago before another division of the API entitled Financing the Petroleum Industry During the 1970's. But even a casual rereading of this tour de force of June 1970 makes me wince. For soon after I delivered this paper I went off to the Orient for a month-long business and vacation trip and when I came back in late July all hell had broken loose -- and almost everything I had labored so hard to portray accurately for the 1970's was knocked into a cocked hat. Just recall these events: Tapline was shut down, Libya was restricting production, tanker rates were skyrocketing, pollution controls and other factors in the United States were causing demand and prices for fuel oil to rise rapidly, and quotas became worth very little. As a result, prices for crude oil were soon forced upwards by Libya and have since climbed again in both the United States and most foreign producing areas. None of these events did I foresee and I wonder, therefore, why the program chairman had the short-sightedness to ask me to appear here today -- and why I had the temerity to accept.About the only statement that has stood the test of time in that forecast was the simple conclusion that worldwide capital requirements would be immense over the decade and that internal cash flow after dividends would be quite inadequate to finance these expenditures. Tremendous borrowings would be required by an industry long proud of its self-sufficiency, and additional equity .would likely be needed.My effort today is, made easier by the papers that have been given before -- particularly the demand and supply data of Mr. Wright. Over the last year and a half, long-range estimates by the industry for crude oil requirements in the world -- but more particularly in the United States -- have risen dramatically. The upward revisions for United States requirements in 1980 have amounted to 10-20%, from 20 million b/d to between 22 and 24 million b/d, a serious indictment of the forecasting ability of the industry's economists. But, in hindsight, the basic reasons were simple -- though total energy growth remains about the same, pollution controls have emphasized low sulfur fuel oil and natural gas in preference to coal and nuclear energy for electrical power generation. However, natural gas itself is in short supply in North America and cannot meet its hoped-for share -- thus the gap must be made up by fuel oil, much of it imported.",,American Petroleum Institute
797,321330,,"Drilling Problems In The Uinta Basin, Utah",L.D. Findley(Gulf Oil Co.-U.S. ming),,,,,,API-72-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"INTRODUCTIONDrilling activity related to the search for oil and gas in the Uinta Basin has intensified greatly during recent months. There are approximately twenty-five active rotary rigs on holes projected to depths ranging from 2,500 feet to below 20,000 feet. Considerable capital is flowing into this area and this is just the beginning. These wells are expensive to drill, complete, and operate. The cost of drilling and completion operations on wells penetrating the Wasatch formation ranges from $400,000 to $2,000,000. The capital outlay for lease production facilities varies from $75,000 t o $150,000, and the monthly operating expenses run from $1,500 t o $3,00O/well. Crude oil transportation charges to market connections approach $0.75/bbl in many cases.Frequent inquiries are received as to why drilling, completion, and operating costs are so high and also as to the reason that dry hole costs on a particular well are so much more than those for a well drilled under similar parameters, located just a few miles away. An attempt will be made to answer these questions insofar as the drilling costs are concerned.The cost of drilling a specific well is directly dependent upon the total depth, pay horizon, terrain upon which the well and access roads are located, weather during drilling operations, and formations penetrated. The formations drilled may have certain characteristics which cause drilling problems to develop. These characteristics vary with the geographic location of the well in the basin. Most of the difficulties that are inherent to drilling operations throughout the world can be found to some degree within this basin. Failure to recognize a potential hazard and to plan accordingly can be painful and expensive.By using good drilling practices, proper equipment, well trained people, and quality materials an operator has the opportunity to minimize costly problems which can occur during drilling and production operations. An extremely brief summary of the historical and geological aspects of this basin has been prepared for the purpose of orientation.UINTA BASIN - NORTHEAST UTAHThe Uinta Basin, as considered in this article, is bounded on the north by the Uinta Mountains, on the west by the Wasatch Mountains and related plateau, on the southwest by the San Rafael Swell, on the southeast by the Uncompahgre Uplift, and on the east by the Douglas Creek Arch (Fig. 2). Geologically speaking, these are all rather recent features with the exception of the Uncompahgre Uplift, which dates back to the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Tectonic activity can be traced right up to the present.The location of the Uinta Basin with respect to the other major basins of the region is shown in Fig. 1. This is a structural, topographic, and sedimentary basin which trends east-west in Northeastern Utah and its axis roughly parallels the Uinta Mountains (Fig. 2). The sediments considered in this paper are tertiary in age and consist of lacustrine and fluvial deposits containing an abundance of clay minerals.",,American Petroleum Institute

Plassey(Chevron Oil Company),,,,,,API-72-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"INTRODUCTIONThe SACROC Unit, one of the nation's largest oil fields, initiated a giant carbon dioxide, (C02) injection project on January 26, 1972. This miscible flood will be the largest secondary recovery project of this type ever undertaken, and is estimated to recover an additional 230 million barrels of oil. The significance of this increase in oil reserves may be realized when it is noted that a field with reserves of this magnitude has not been discovered in the United States for 10 years-with the exception of Alaska..This project will require the injection of 629 billion cubic feet (37 million tons) of C02over an approximate 9 year period into 202 pattern injection wells. The total cost of the project is estimated to be in excess of $175,000,000, which includes a field C02and water distribution system and conversion of the pattern wells to injection at SACROC, expansion of SACROC's producing and water injection facilities; the installation of the C02delivery system and the purchase and transportation of C02to SACROC. The C02will be transported through a 220 mile pipeline system from Val Verde Basin gas fields in Southwest Texas to SACROC requiring 81,000 HP compressor capacity to deliver the C02at a final pressure of 2400 psi. Canyon Reef Carriers, Inc. (CRC) has been formed by the major SACROC owners to construct and operate the C02pipeline system.This paper summarizes the management, engineering and planning considerations in the design and implementation of this project. It has required the assistance and cooperation of the legal, financial and engineering representatives from SACROC's major owners and a major facility expansion by the 3 gasoline plants, 5 oil pipeline companies and 2 gas purchasers' pipelines which service the SACROC Unit.HISTORYThe SACROC Unit is located in West Texas near the town of Snyder in Scurry County, as shown in Figure 1. The 50,000 acre unit comprises 98% of the Kelly-Snyder Field and is the major unitized field among 4 units in the 35 mile by 5 mile Canyon Reef formation. The field was discovered in the fall of 1948 and by 1951 at least 2,000 wells had been drilled.It became apparent from the rapid pressure decline that a pressure maintenance program would be required to prevent excessive loss of recoverable reserves. In 1953 the Texas Railroad Commission approved unitization of SACROC and the installation of a unique centerline water injection program. The waterflood project was initiated in 1954 and the performance since that time is shown in Figure 2. The SACROC Unit was first operated in three segments by Standard Oil Company of Texas, Sun Oil Company, and Mobil Oil Corporation under a joint Unit Manager's office until 1962 when Standard Oil of Texas (now Chevron Oil Company-Western Division) was elected operator. The Unit presently has 1256 wells which have produced more than 500 million barrels of oil to date. There are 329 working interest owners including almost all of the major oil companies in the nation and 2,750 royalty owners.",,American Petroleum Institute

Turtle(Shell Development Company),,,,,,API-72-E001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"INTRODUCTIONIf our nation is to achieve its goals in air and water conservation each business segment must make continued progress. This will require research. This paper will be concerned with the research needs of the petroleum producer, who has the responsibility for the environment surrounding drilling and production facilities. It will cover needs both onshore and offshore. A companion paper will discuss offshore needs in more detail.As background for this paper we conducted surveys of environmental conditions at several oil field locations. We also carried out exploratory research in an attempt to define potential problems and to develop leads. We feel that many problems are common to all producers and therefore propose that the industry gather facts and data concerning these problems in a cooperative manner. The purpose of this paper is to outline problems, furnish approaches and suggest a cooperative program to obtain solutions. Such a program would be confined to the gathering of facts and data. Each participant would determine for itself what use it would make of the facts and data so gathered.WATER DISCHARGEThe petroleum industry produces a large volume of brine. Onshore the brine is usually treated and reinjected into an underground formation with adequate control to insure that potable ground waters will not be affected. Offshore the produced brine is often treated and discharged into the ocean. The treatment involves a separation phase for reducing the oil content to an acceptable level. A discussion of this level is given in a companion paper.1Currently, the environmental standard for oil content in discharged water is that it cause no sheen'' on the receiving water. Because this standard is subjective a redefinition in more precise quantitative terms is desirable. By conducting additional research now, the petroleum producer can help define what oil levels are achievable, as well as the costs of achievement.The first stage in such research should be a process review of the entire sequence of oil-water separation steps. An improvement upstream in primary oil-water separation might greatly simplify downstream processing where small amounts of oil are removed. Downstream process research should aim at both short-range and long-range goals -- short range, the aim would be to understand and then optimize present methods of oil droplet separation by flotation; long range, novel methods would be sought.Research on separation by flotation should be aimed at developing sufficient technology regarding dissolved gas, sparged gas, and mechanical flotation cells to permit optimum selection and operation. To obtain this basic knowledge, tests on laboratory models should be conducted to determine the influence of such variables as gas/oil ratio, feed rate, and inlet concentration on outlet concentration and separation efficiency. Methods for controlling the particle size of the oil drops in the flotation cell feed and for determining the effect of droplet size on equipment performance should be determined. With this basic information a mathematical model of the oil drop-gas bubble encounter could be developed.",,American Petroleum Institute

Smith(Phillips Petroleum Company),,,,,,API-72-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"The petroleum industry needs new oil and can easily afford any geophysical research that will successfully help find it.About 95% of geophysics in the petroleum industry is devoted to seismic methods, which seem likely to continue in importance.In seismic exploration, geophysicists have been working only one side of the road and are now starting to work the other. As on a mountain road, the view below has continued to improve until at the ridge there has now appeared another view of equal or greater interest.This new view has already provided examples of importance to stratigraphic trap exploration.Finally, mention will be made of the small amount of API geophysical research and how importantly it relates to the present expansive period in geophysical technology.INTRODUCTIONSo far the petroleum industry has always been able to afford the things that have helped it -- even many which have not. Geophysics long ago became a necessity and the need to use it more effectively is still increasing. As stated in January by Mr. Gonzales in discussing domestic supply, The potential exists for more rapid development of U.S. oil and gas resources if accelerated exploration, drilling, and recovery become economically attractive . He also mentioned a potential .....in range of several hundred billion barrels of oil and around 1,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . Hence, there is no needto question if industry can afford geophysical research; the question is can research be successful when measured against realistic criteria . The API Exploration Committee has referred to the necessity for maintaining an aggressive exploration effort . . . . . , and geophysicists have learned from past experience that when the term aggressive is used they generally must improve , as well as try harder . Success will not come easily or automatically but will require a hybrid geoscientists type of approach combining a high level of technical sophistication with more effective interdisciplinary and managerial teamwork.Geophysics is probably the most technology-intensive part of petroleum industry operations. Because of the close relationship between research and operations, future expectations of the former can be discussed about equally well in terms of what is happening in the latter Seismic work continues' to comprise nearly 95% .of all geophysical activity,1with the remainder divided about equally between gravity and airborne magnetic surveys. Future expectations for continuation of this strong reliance on seismic should depend upon its degree of maturity with respect to ultimate capability and upon its present position in the cyclic development-exploitation stages that seem to characterize evolution in technical areas.For quite a period prior to the early to mid 1960's it was widely believed that seismic exploration had become nearly a static technology, susceptible only to cost-reduction efforts. It was thought to have plateaued out. Practically all effort culminated in the seismic record section as the subsurface picture . As often happens after a quiescent period, then came what was probably the most amazing revolutionary change that has occurred in the petroleum industry, even more intense and complete than the early shift from cable tool to rotary drilling. The change brought about by digital recording and processing and a host of signal enhancement techniques such as common-reflection-point stacking and deconvolution was so great that a competent employee returning from a two-year leave could find himself totally unfamiliar and unable to operate the new field equipment or data processing equipment,",,American Petroleum Institute

To minimize lag time in applying proved technology, concentrated effort by highly-motivated, well-trained field personnel is needed. To provide these personnel, effective long-term training programs are required as an integral part of management strategy. Criteria of an effective training program are developed with emphasis on the need for motivation of the trainee and the inclusion of operating managers at the decision-making levels in the program.INTRODUCTIONIndustry speeches and publications are filled with a myriad of problems facing the U.S. oil and gas producing industry. These problems relate directly or indirectly to the need forincreased oil and gas reserves;higher oil and gas producing capacity; andhigher profits. For partial solutions the Industry looks forward to such events as approval of additional offshore drilling and the Alaska pipeline, and a favorable attitude by the Federal Power Commission.Most of us realize that these events alone cannot provide reserves, capacities, and profits required by the Industry either on a short or long- term basis.TECHNOLOGY UTILIZATIONAlthough it is unlikely our problems related to politics will be resolved very soon, there are a number of approaches that can be and are being taken within the Industry to improve producing economics. One approach is to more aggressively pursue effective technology utilization in producing operations. Interior Secretary Rogers Morton, speaking at the November 1971 meeting of the American Petroleum Institute in San Francisco, added government support to this approach by urging the Industry to improve its technology for discovering and recovering oil and gas from conventional deposits as a part of Interior's plan to provide adequate clean-energy sources for the future.1The development of profit-making techniques and equipment by oil companies, service companies, and tool companies is a continuing process. There is ample evidence to show the potential of optimum use of technology to increase profits, well-producing capacity, and recoverable reserves. Obviously, new technology requires careful evaluation, but to delay application of any significant technology, regardless of where or by whom it is developed, can convert many modest profit areas of U.S. oil production into salvage operations and seriously reduce the economic potential of more prolific areas. It is clear that we must minimize lag time in applying profitable ideas in our oil and gas fields. As an Industry, we have attempted to do this through trade journals, associations, such as, American Petroleum Institute and Society of Petroleum Engineers, and through formal training, either in-house company courses, or courses open to all companies sponsored by universities or other groups.Has the Industry been able to effectively and quickly use new technology? The answer is generallyYESwhen applied to technology involving Reservoir Engineering, Geology, and Geophysics.",,American Petroleum Institute
802,321335,,The Outlook For Synthetic Fuels,Henry R. Linden(Institute of Gas Technology Chicago Illinois),,,,,,API-72-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"All indications are that the United States is nearing the end of virtual energy self-sufficiency. In 1969 and 1970, net energy imports still amounted to only 8 to 9 percent of inland consumption.+Substantial net imports of crude oil and petroleum products and lesser amounts of natural gas were partially offset by large net exports of coal. However, this situation is changing rapidly because, of the shortage in the domestic supply of clean fuels required in air pollution control. Natural gas, which was expected to continue to pick up much of t h i s rapidly growing market, has approached its peak producibility in the lower 48 states. Domestic supplies of low sulfur fuel oil are equally short because of insufficient U.S. refining capacity, compounded by an inadequate and gradually declining productive capacity for oil in the lower 48 states. Electric energy supply is already growing at a rate which will be difficult to sustain, much less increase further so as to make up a portion of the clean energy shortage. In view of the limited supply of non-polluting fossil fuels and the delays in commercialization of both technically and economically feasible stack-gas cleanup processes, nuclear energy will have to provide a large share of electric growth. Unfortunately, this source of energy supply has consistently fallen short of expectations because of a host of problems not under the control of the utility industry.Before assessing the potential of synthetic fuels to stem the growing dependence on foreign energy sources, it should be helpful to examine proposed alternatives and to analyze the impact of imports as a solution to domestic energy deficiencies. The scope of this paper is too broad to perm it discussion and comparison of the various technologies for production of synthetic gaseous and liquid fuels from coal, oil shale, and tar sands. There is abundant published information in these areas. Instead, it will be attempted to project the impact of synthetic fuels on the energy supply demand balance, assuming that the present indications of their economic and technical feasibility will be substantiated within the next few years.ALTERNATIVES FOR CLOSING THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPPLY-DEMAND GAPObviously, the U.S. economy will not accept chronic energy shortages, nor will the Government retreat from its policy of environmental protection. The short term solution is, without question, greatly increased imports of clean fuels; that is, natural gas and low-sulfur fuel oils. The energy industry, with concurrence of Government, is already following this course. In the somewhat longer term, these sources of clean fuel can, and undoubtedly will, be supplemented with substantial quantities of synthetic pipeline gas produced from low-boiling, paraffinic petroleum liquids such as light naphtha and, hopefully, with low sulfur fuel oil produced increasingly in domestic refineries . Increased U.S. low-sulfur fuel oil refining capacity could also provide a larger domestic source of feedstocks for gasification. Again, Government and industry are in general accord in these objectives, although the best means for achieving them are still uncertain.",,American Petroleum Institute

Toronto Ontario Canada),,,,,,API-72-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"INTRODUCTIONLet me begin by defining the scope and terms of this paper. Fig. 1 shows the North American Arctic and its geographic relationship to Canada. I will confine my remarks to the Canadian Arctic however because I am not qualified to discuss Alaskan or Greenland hydrocarbon potential. In discussing the Canadian Arctic, I will take a Literal geographic definition and talk about the territory north of the Arctic Circle.As to format and content, I will in effect discuss two topics:First, the sedimentary basins of the Canadian Arctic, the environment for exploration in these basins, and Imperial's and others' views as to their hydrocarbon potential.Second, some generalized comments on the economics of development of Arctic hydrocarbon resources.THE SEDIMENTARY BASINS OF THE CANADIAN ARCTICFig. 2 identifies the principal geologic subdivisions of the Arctic and shows the types of sedimentary rocks in the territory of interest. The designated dashed area is underlain by largely Devonian to Cambrian age rocks, although on the mainland a large part of it has a cover of younger rocks. In the Arctic Islands, the north border of this area where it joins the Sverdrup Basin is highly folded.This whole older Paleozoic area is somewhat analogous to the provincial portion of the Western Canada Sedimentary basin because of the age of the rocks and their gentle dip from the Precambrian Shield toward fold belts. Slightly south of the Arctic Circle it contains one significant hydrocarbon pool at Norman Wells, which emphasizes the similarity to Western Canada in as much as this pool is located in a Devonian age reef.The sedimentary basins identified by vertical stripes on Fig. 2 are significantly different. While each contains more or less Devonian to Cambrian rocks at the base of the sedimentary section, they are distinguished by the fact that they contain significant thicknesses of young Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and sometimes Tertiary rocks.' In our view, it is these basins which contain the majority of the hydrocarbon potential of the Canadian Arctic.The Eagle Plains basin lies between the Richardson and Ogilvie Mountains, and contains up t o 20,000 feet of total sedimentary rock. Up to 10,000 feet of this is late Paleozoic and Mesozoic. The basin contains major structures.As indicated on Fig. 2, what we are calling the Beaufort Basin is really a rather arbitrary subdivision of a much larger coastal margin basin which extends from the North Slope of Alaska, across the Yukon and Northwest Territories coasts surrounding the delta of the Mackenzie River, and on across the western edge of the Arctic Islands where it is quite imperfectly known, at least to my organization. In the onshore portion of the Beaufort Basin, 30 wells have been drilled and 4 are now drilling.The Beaufort Basin has a floor of Proterozoic and Paleozoic rocks. The basin fill consists mostly of sandstones and shales of which the bulk is Cretaceous and Tertiary in age.",,American Petroleum Institute

Unless we can demonstrate to the public, Federal and local officials, the Congress, and ourselves, that OCS petroleum operations can be conducted safely, it seems plain t h a t the future development of oil and gas offshore is in serious jeopardy. Not until each of us responsible for OCS petroleum operations accepts this fact, will we be able t o make meaningful progress towards the solution of the safety problem that now confronts us.By safety we mean the avoidance of accidents that result in injury or loss of life -- human life, bird and animal life, and marine life ; we mean the protection of property -- public land, private land, and the facilities of industry; and we mean the protection of the environment from pollution , i.e., pollution prevention and pollution control.Who is responsible for safety? Basically, of course, the one who initiate and undertakes an operation is responsible for its safe conduct. But in nearly all endeavors involving construction and the use of power and machinery, the determination of what needs to be done to achieve safety is not left entirely to the judgment of the operator, but is expressed and monitored in some form of public regulatory and inspection system. In ocs drilling and production operations, the U.S. Geological Survey is the organization with prime responsibility for seeing that industry does the job properly. This responsibility ? the supervision of operations and direction of activities for the enforcement of safety regulations -- was given to the Secretary of the Interior by the Outer continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (Public Law 212) and delegated by him to the Geological Survey. We, of course, carry out this assignment in strict accordance with law and regulations.But there is more than just the law involved. There is the matter of national need for energy fuels; and there is the concern for our environment.I will not discuss the subject of need today, other than to repeat the words of Secretary of the Interior, Rogers. C.B. Morton, at a meeting of Atlantic Coast Governors and other State officials on January 11, 1972, when he said: Unless we undertake drastic changes in our style of living, in our transportation and in our economy -- reconverting to a bucolic society and becoming a second rate national power -- there is no alternative but to continue the use of oil and gas reserves .As for environmental protection, I am sure we all agree with our President who stated in the Second Annual Report of the Council on Environmental Quality: The work of environmental improvement is a task for all our people .

It occurred to me that an apt title for my thoughts might be, Never have so few been abused by so many who know so little .Considering the ridiculous excesses of mistrust and misunderstanding about the oil and natural gas industries , which seem to have been on the rise in Washington since I left Congress in 1955, I was not , sure whether to deliver a sympathy address, make a pep talk or send a telegram.The fact is, I do not really want t o do any of those things. What I do want to attempt is, a sensible presentation based on research and some, rational thinking. That, in my judgment, is something we need more, of today. If there is one thing both the over-zealous c r i t i c s and supporters of particular , industries and causes could, use today, it is a lot less invective and a lot more rationality .As I am sure you know, both the oil and natural gas segments of the industry have been trying to shake a lot of erroneous reasoning about our energy supply since at least 1944, when Justice Jackson said , ...the wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or reproduce a natural gas field perhaps. But I do not have to tell you that the wit of man and a little of Midas' wealth can, find a new field and it can extend the life of an old one. Yet, despite all which has happened in terms of shortages and falling reserves, the belief persists in many quarters t h a t since the supply of our resources infinite , higher prices will not lead to an increase in presently available supply.In fact , the Federal Power Commission and the Courts have just recently conceded that price increases for natural gas might be necessary to obtain additional supplies after all . Yet the product is still not allowed to sell at anything approaching its true economic value i n the market. You all know the effect field price ceilings have had on exploration. You have seen the amount you can budget for exploration either shrink or remain constant, while your costs have increased substantially . The results were predictable.",,American Petroleum Institute

That may be true. But it is also true that our best missionaries come from the ranks of those who understand our problems.During recent months, I am sure you have all heard a great deal -- perhaps more than you care to know -- about the U.S. energy situation . There has been a steadily growing awareness i n business, government, and academic circles that there are some ominous clouds looming on our energy horizon. A recent survey of public attitudes in representative markets showed that 81 percent of the adults believe the U.S. will face a serious energy shortage unless new sources of oil and gas are found. We had a sharp intimation of what an energy shortage can mean in the power shut-down in the New York area on November 9, 1965. For a brief period lights went out, TV sets went dark, kitchen ranges grew cold, and elevators stalled between floors.Recent events in Great Britain gave us an even more vivid warning of what an energy crisis can mean to a modern industrial nation. The prolonged coal miners? strike shut down factories ; threw about two million people out of work; left offices , stores , and homes without light or heat , for hours at a time; imperiled the supply of milk, eggs, bread, and sugar; reduced even Buckingham Palace to the use of candlelight; and threatened an overturn of the government.Unfortunately, the concern about energy matters aroused by these and other related events has thus far produced much confusion and little in the way of constructive action. The energy situation has gotten to be a little bit like the weather; everybody talks about it but nobody does much to improve it. And so my purpose today will be to go back to the fundamentals and deal with three simple questions:first, what is the problem;second, what are the causes; and third , how do we find our way out of the woods.THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOKLet me begin by suggesting t h a t bur energy problems lie primarily in our medium-term, rather than our long-term, future. From a long-term standpoint, our basic energy position is reasonably sound. This nation was liberally endowed with basic energy materials. We are certainly far better off in this regard than many other industrial nations of the world, such as Japan and the countries of Western Europe.At the present time, we are consuming about 68 quadrillion BTU's per annum, and our needs will probably double by 1985. To meet these requirements, we have crude oil , natural gas, coal, uranium, hydroelectric power, shale oil , and geothermal power. Taken in the aggregate, these energy resources have a BTU content sufficient to meet our needs for at least 100 years or more.",,American Petroleum Institute

Swidler(New York State Public Service Commission),,,,,,API-72-N001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"I am truly appreciative of the opportunity to address the American Petroleum Institute. The invitation implies a large measure of tolerance and, I assume, at least a slight curiosity. On past performance there is every reason to expect that on some major points what I have to say may not conform with prevailing industry views. Some of the older generation among you will recall that I spoke at the 41st Annual Meeting of the API in Chicago in November of 1961. My talk was substantially a defense of the application of the Natural Gas Act to the regulation of producer prices and a discussion of how such regulation could be administered most effectively . I was heard out with patience, and received all and more than the applause which politeness required, but nothing that occurred could have led me to assume that I had struck a sympathetic spark, much less that I achieved any conversions. I have tried to be philosophical about these differences. If we can just continue to speak to one another every decade or so, perhaps we shall ultimately come to a close rapport.I shall concern myself first to a few questions related to oil supply, then turn to natural gas problems, and , finally to the increasingly important area of energy conservation.A starting point in discussions of energy policy is an attempt to discern the fue1 trends of the future. The NPC forecast for 1980 contemplates coal consumption of 800 million tons in that year, and oi1,consumption of 22.5 million , barrels per day. The estimates are, of course, related, and to the extent one is high the other is likely to below. The staff of the New York State Public Service Commission has made its own calculations as to energy requirements and supply in the next decade and has come up with figures on coal and oil which are significantly different from those of the NPC, and even more pessimistic. I believe pessimistic is the right word, although some of you may differ ; at any rate , we see less coal and more oil than did NPC in the 1980 scene. I present this analysis with, some diffidence, because NPC forecasts are not to be taken lightly .We start with the fact that the construction of coal-fired and nuclear power plants is lagging, primarily for environmental reasons, including the regulatory delays which result from opposition on environmental grounds. In New York State there has been a substantial conversion of coal-burning facilities to oil . So far as I am aware no new coal-burning plant is now proposed for the New England States, New York, or New Jersey, and conversions are likely to diminish the amount of coal-burning capacity year by year under pressure from environmental authorities because of the sulphur problem.",,American Petroleum Institute

Clewell(Mobil Oil Corporation),,,,,,API-72-R001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 6-8 March, Houston, Texas",1972,"INTRODUCTIONThe petroleum industry spends over $500 million per year on research and development. Costs have been rising because of inflation at the rate of 6% per year in the past few years just to hold the effort constant. The natural question asked by management is -- can we offset this inflation by increased efficiency? Can we get more for our dollar?In the petroleum industry we have, for the past few years, been trimming our sails by eliminating our lowest priority projects. We have also been eliminating or at least deferring a fair amount of long term research so that our remaining resources can be concentrated on nearer term research during this period of a distressed economy. In so doing we are, of course, running the risk of going too far in sacrificing the future for the benefit of the present. Even though I doubt we have gone too far in the petroleum industry, it is a concern of t he President's Office of Science Technology regarding all of industrial research in the U. S. There is another way we can categorize our projects, namely:Basic data generation;Projects that are primarily for the benefit of the petroleum industry ;Projects that provide a proprietary benefit t o the company undertaking the research; i.e., the results can, be retained for exclusive use at least for a reasonable period of time .Definitions of these three categories cannot be made so precisely that every project clearly fits only one or the other, but the breakdown is useful when considering the possibilities of cooperative research.COOPERATIVE RESEARCHOne way to make the research dollar produce more for an individual company is to find ways of sharing research costs with other companies. Projects in the first two categories listed above are potential candidates for cooperative research.Cooperative research is not a new idea. The American Petroleum Institute has, for many years, provided a mechanism for generating basic data (category 1). For example, a t the present time the API has about $5 million available for research in the area of air and water pollution i n 1972; $2.6 million for new projects , and $2.3 million for the continuation of previous projects. Nearly half of this ($2.2 million) is aimed at defining in a quantitative fashion the problems of auto emissions. Most, all members of the petroleum industry share these API costs. However, the research program on auto emissions is nearly three times the $2.2 million being spent by API. The cost of the actual program is shared i n nearly equal amounts by API, the Automobile Manufacture's Association, and the Federal Government. The cost for an individual company is thus a very small fraction of the actual cost of the research to which the company has access.In addition to research on pollution, the API for many years has pursued research in Exploration, Production, Refining, and Marketing.",,American Petroleum Institute

Geffen(Amoco Production Company),,,,,,API-73-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 9-11 April, Denver, Colorado",1973,"Up to 55 billion barrels of already discovered oil (or nearly twice the current U.S. recoverable reserves) is the potential of tertiary recovery.Delays in applying tertiary methods could mean abandonment of wells, thus irrevocable loss of oil production.The added cost, above well operating expense, for tertiary oil ranges from $0.75 to $1.50 in ideal applications. During pioneer applications, there will be a higher than normal number of marginal performers and failures. So the real average cost to industry will be greater until advancement up the learning curve minimizes the risk.Other economic considerations that influence the degree of commercial attractiveness are the heavy financial front-loading and time-delayed income characteristics of tertiary projects. In addition, the cost of unloading water from flooded reservoirs will have to be carried by the project.Recent public statements made by government and industry spokesmen have not given sufficient attention to this important potential source that could help reduce the energy crunch.Tertiary recovery can have the uniquely desirable features of using already made investments (i.e., wells and facilities in operating fields and pipelines) for further income generation, of adding no new situations to environmental concerns, and of providing a supply within the U.S. borders.Adding tertiary oil to the recoverable U.S. reserves category could contribute to the continuation of America's high standard of living and to keeping energy factors from unduly influencing our international affairs.The technology is available to conduct tertiary recovery operations. API's Fundamental Research Program has made important contributions. Future breakthroughs will be economical more than technological.Except in selected fields, tertiary recovery investments are not now economically competitive with other methods to increase domestic crude supplies.The most promising tertiary methods are the miscible and thermal types.Extensive field testing experience under favorable and controlled conditions is urgently required to uncover the factors that require further investigation so that the risk of applying tertiary recovery methods is reduced. Results must be made available at an early date to collapse the time required to develop industry confidence in their use.Special equipment (such as compressors and steamers as well as supplies of chemicals and flooding fluids) is limited in terms of its rate of availability. Planning for manufacturing of these items should be given immediate attention if tertiary methods are to be used in the maximum number of suitable fields.Some of the special fluids used are petroleum or petroleum-derived and their costs will increase. Others, like C02, are available at a low cost only in a few locations and in limited quantities.INTRODUCTIONThe fuel crisis has arrived that the industry foresaw several years ago. Natural gas, fuel oil, and diesel oil shortages are a reality in many areas of the country. Even in oil country , peak demands during this winter's cold spells have made the reality felt by the public. Gasoline shortages next summer will add to the number of Americans who will face the unpleasant fact.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hammons(U.S. Geological Surrey),,,,,,API-73-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 9-11 April, Denver, Colorado",1973,"With the passage of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in 1953, the Federal Government took upon itself the responsibility for the minerals management of submerged lands in the zone between recognized State waters and the 200-meter water depth contour and beyond. These areas off the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Alaskan coasts are collectively known as the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), the mineral rights of which belong to the United States as established by Congress and recognized by international law. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act effectively extended and adapted the Federal responsibilities of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to apply to this offshore acreage.The need for geophysical data to support effective resource evaluation and supervision of operations involved in mineral management programs on the Federal OCS has long been recognized by both the oil and gas industry and the Conservation Division of the Geological Survey. However, budgetary support for marine geophysics in the Division's mineral management program was not approved until 1968, when the Bureau of the Budget recommended that a fair market value be determined for offshore leases. The Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969 focused congressional attention on the need for environmental protection. Geophysical data are essential for such critical management problems.The search for petroleum reserves to meet energy needs is being directed more and more toward quantitative physical measurements -- to geophysics, and especially to mathematically-based seismic velocity analyses. Current trends indicate that geophysics will be able to supply an ever larger portion of the information needed for responsible offshore mineral leasing programs.Because the water covering the OCS effectively precludes normal surface geologic mapping and the lack of well control on undrilled areas of the OCS makes subsurface geologic mapping of wildcat acreage inadequate for analysis purposes, geophysical techniques are the primary source of information for the evaluation of new offshore areas.Prior to 1970, no modern exploration common depth point (CDP) seismic data were available to the Conservation Division. Consequently, the Government was forced to make its lease-sale tract selection decisions aided by very limited geotechnical information. Tract selections were generally made without the benefit of subsurface structural information.Tracts to be offered at a given offshore lease sale were selected mainly on the basis, of various statistical analyses and/or company nominations. Geotechnical inputs to the tract selection process consisted of regional geological studies based on comparisons with the nearest producing structures, sometimes many miles away.In March 1970, the Conservation Division purchased its first modern seismic data using standard Government competitive procurement procedures. To date, the Geological Survey has purchased over 40,000 linear miles of state-of-the-art seismic reflection (CDP) data on the Gulf of Mexico OCS at a total cost of approximately $1.8 million. These data were all acquired competitively from industrial sources, and represent an economical, technically excellent seismic data base. Modern seismic data have also been acquired on the Gulf of Alaska, Pacific, and Atlantic OCS areas.",,American Petroleum Institute

The greatest uncertainty, however, is just how much of our future supply will come from the offshore areas and, from a total national viewpoint, what is the best way to develop and utilize the potential when balanced against all other alternatives. The evolution, present status and near term status of offshore drilling and production technology is reviewed and summarized. The application of this technology to the development of the petroleum potential of the continental margins (0 to 2500 meters) of the USA is discussed and illustrated. Some effects of hopefully accelerated offshore leasing are examined.INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to help provide the answers to at least a part of these questions by summarizing quantitatively the industry's existing capability to provide offshore drilling and producing systems. In doing so it will be instructive to show the evolution of the various segments of offshore drilling and producing technology and to show how we got to where we are today. Without attempting to quantify the tremendous efforts, either in terms of manpower or dollars, I will show where technology stands as of today and where it will very likely be in the next four or five years more or less under existing momentum. I will also discuss how this technology is related to the total potential of the continental margins of the U.S.A. The development of future technology will depend a great deal on the consistent progressive application of today's technology as well as the overall assessment of the rewards and benefits to be achieved by advancing the technology. Remember that technology is not only the acquisition and possession of scientific knowledge but more than that, it is the application of scientific knowledge. Let me bring this point home. I am not aware of any field of scientific endeavor which has even possessed or purported to possess the final answer to a particular problem before attempting a solution. There have always been uncertainties and there always will be; but, the uncertainties diminish by orders of magnitude as soon as someone accomplishes the feat . Then everyone jumps on the bandwagon and says, I knew it could be done! Ladies and Gentlemen, the Petroleum Industry, and more particularly the offshore segment of that industry, is no different in this regard from any other field of scientific endeavor. Categorical guarantees just are not in the cards. The real question and often times the most significant problem then is what is the best possible assessment of the realities of a potential course of action; in other words, Which experts should one believe? And let's face it, this is no small task because the issues are complex and interwoven and the experts are numerous",,American Petroleum Institute
812,321345,,A System Approach To Offshore Facility Design,K.E. Arnold(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-73-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 9-11 April, Denver, Colorado",1973,"The typical facility concept employed by Shell Oil is described and the guidelines included in the system design are discussed. While the process concepts of an offshore facility are relatively simple, the space restrictions of an offshore platform require that consideration be given to the interdependent nature of the various components to assure safety. This is best accomplished by establishing procedures and guidelines for design and analyzing in detail a typical facility which is used as the basis for all new facility designs.INTRODUCTIONIn order to minimize the effort involved in assuring an adequate system analysis which would consider the interaction between the various components, Shell in 1967 designed a standard oil treating facility. The same basic detailed flowsheet and system analysis was used for six almost identical facilities. The basic flow scheme and philosophy of design of the standard facilities have been proven sound. However, experience indicated several areas where improvements could be made to the concept of a standard facility and in 1971 work was begun on developing the typical facility concept described herein.DISCUSSIONPROCESS FLOWThe first step in establishing a typical facility is to design process flowsheets such as those shown in Figures 1 and 2. These portray the basic interdependence of the various equipment components. Spaces are provided for the project engineer to fill in the design parameters (e. g., flow rates, gravities, temperatures) that are needed to size the equipment. Basically, the process flow chosen for the Shell typical facility can be described as follows:Primary Separation and TestProvision is made for one or two test vessels which may either be Chem-Electric test treaters or three phase test separators. Two or three stages of separation are provided. Gas is routed from the high pressure separator direct to dehydration and sales. A low pressure system is provided to reduce back pressure on the wells for more efficient recovery, and an intermediate pressure separator is provided if economically justified by compressor horsepower savings.Liquid from each separator is flashed through the next lowest pressure separator. The low pressure separator also functions as a free water knockout (FWKO).Oil Dehydration and SalesFrom the FWKO oil flows through a heat exchanger to a bulk Chem-Electric treater. (The heat medium subsystem is shown on a different flowsheet.) To minimize back pressure the FWKO operates as close as possible to compressor suction pressure. Flash gas from the bulk treater must be flared. If the bulk treater were operated at compressor suction pressure, the back pressure at the wells would be increased and gas flashed below compressor suction pressure would still be vented at the tank. Therefore, even though it may not appear so at first glance, operating the bulk treater below atmospheric pressure does not add to vented gas.Oil flows from the bulk treater to the dry oil tank, through the LACT unit and is pumped to the pipeline.",,American Petroleum Institute

About the only generalization that can be made in this regard is that the operations are more expensive. I do not mean to imply by the title of my paper thatallof tomorrow's oil will be found in deep water or by deep drilling, but this will characterize the frontiers for exploration. Just how deep and where, I hope to bring out in my paper.When Ernie Petree asked me if I would undertake to discuss the prospects for escalating the discovery and development of oil and gas supplies, he expressed concern that some forecasts of future potential have come out with some rather large numbers arrived at in a somewhat abstract fashion. Pete asked if I would, therefore, deal more specifically with the potential areas and express my ideas on the steps that should be taken to increase our exploration.I, too, share a concern about the size of some of the potential forecasts. Last August in testimony before Senator Jackson's Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, I pointed out that frequently expressions such as awaiting discovery or there remains to be discovered were followed by very large numbers without also quoting the pertinent qualifications. Unfortunately, in the tendency for abbreviated reference, important qualifying terms may be left out and the big numbers are made to sound like they are actuallyreserveseasily attainable by the punch of a computer button or the twist of a valve.You in the business know there are some long, uncertain and agonizing steps between future potential reservespublished by the estimators and, tossed around by the economists and politicians tobarrel-in-factthat have to be revealed by the explorationist?s drill bit.My real concern is that the big numbers impress those not familiar with exploration and may impart a false sense of security about the future potential for our domestic oil and gas. I have been cautioning my exploration friends that overly enthusiastic assertions like just give us the incentives and we will deliver the oil - all you need can be unwittingly deceptive. For if these incentives do come, and yet we can not deliver, then we have played into the hands of those who are just waiting to say, Well, it is obvious you guys either can not or will not do the job, so it is best Uncle Sam take over . To put this in blunt terms: overstating our capability could help open the way to nationalization of the oil industry.We do have a good resource base, but a more specific evaluation of this potential is needed at once so that, hopefully, we can as a nation deal from a position of strength in the world's petroleum markets. Let me illustrate the imperative for early evaluation drilling by these two examples:",,American Petroleum Institute

I hope to do more today than add to the heat.From the number of stories I read every day in the trade journals and the Houston papers on talks on this subject it seems that Mark Twain's well known comment about the weather - everybody talks about it, but nobody does anything about it - may apply equally these days to the energy problem. I expect, however, that the President's forthcoming message on national energy policy - which, as you know, has been delayed for several weeks - will soon move us from the talking stage into one of action. Members of Congress are also demonstrating keen interest and determination to see that things get moving.Anxious as we all are for action, I think we ought, nevertheless, to be patient. I have little doubt that the Administration has a sound grasp of the energy problem and that in due course we shall get some of the solutions we seek. We are professionally immersed in the energy situation and it has top priority, for us. But the government has of course to cope with a wide range of problems. When we put things in perspective, it should not be too surprising that combating inflation has current priority. If, in a difficult balancing act, in dealing with inflation, energy, international monetary, and trade problems, the Administration for the moment takes measures that are not immediately helpful to the needs of the oil industry we ought not to become too quickly discouraged.In fact, when the time comes, I believe the President's message will be constructive and helpful. It should mark the beginning of the end of the period of uncertainty over future government policies. Many of the Administration's proposals will be subject to Congressional debate, but the message should give a strong indication of what we may expect in the way of governmental ground rules for the conduct of our business.Dealing with uncertainty is part and parcel of our daily work as we make commitments involving very large sums of money and many years of work, But the addition of uncertainties over possible government policy on, for example, prices, taxation, and leasing opportunities, on top of normal operating uncertainties, impedes rational decisions about these very costly and long-term undertakings. Removal of doubts by a constructively directed public policy will free the industry to take action on long-term solutions to the energy problem.There can be no doubt that the President's message will recognize the inescapable fact that petroleum will be called upon to supply the bulk of our energy needs at least through the mid-1980s. This fact means that the industry must be kept healthy and at the same time it places a great responsibility on everyone involved in oil exploration and production.",,American Petroleum Institute

Department of the Interior),,,,,,API-73-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 9-11 April, Denver, Colorado",1973,"Not too many years ago, I suspect, it would have been somewhat remarkable for a Director of the Bureau of Mines to speak to an audience of petroleum producers on the subject of synthetic fluid fuels from coal. It would have been even more remarkable, I am sure, for you to have invited a speech on such a subject. I think this is a good indication of how our thinking has changed in the past couple of decades.No longer do we think of individual fuel commodities competing intensely for limited markets. Our concept today is of, a single huge energy market, which is growing so fast, that it takes every fuel-resource we have -- and then some -- to try to keep up with it. And to complicate the problem, we cannot hope to satisfy this burgeoning market simply with fuel. It must be clean fuel.We are, as you know, faced in the short term with highly probable energy shortages. I am referring to the period up to about 1985. Over the longer term, an energy crisis of major proportions looms. Unless we do everything sensible that can be done with our fuel resources and do it very quickly, these events are inevitable. Hence, the subject of my paper.The phrase Clean Synthetic Fluid Fuels From Coal , implies that it is possible to obtain adequate and dependable supplies of fuel without sacrificing the quality of our air, water, and land. I am convinced that it is possible. Because of the long lead times needed to develop technical feasibility, into commercial reality, however, we must make vigorous effortsnowif we are to do it.The available options for clean. fuels include many exotic sources, Like solar and geothermal power, fuel cells, and thermionic and thermoelectric systems. But we have three basic energy criteria -- abundance, reliability, and commercial availability by 1985. Only processes based on converting coal and oil shale to clean, synthetic fluid fuels can meet all three.Why coal? Simply because it is our most abundant domestic natural fuel. Recoverablereserves, estimated at 390 billion tons, would last about 600 years at the current rate of consumption. If we use our coalresources,estimated at 32 trillion tans, as a base, coal's availability at the current rate of consumption would increase proportionately. Even though all this coal could not be recovered economically with present mining technology, there is time to develop new technologies for the recovery of energy fromallof our coal.Technologies for converting coal to gas and to oil have been around for a long time, but they do not entirely meet today's needs for clean synthetic gases and oils at reasonable costs. Consequently, intensive research and development work has been conducted during the past 10 years or so, and this work has led to second-generation conversion concepts -- concepts that are better suited to our current national needs.",,American Petroleum Institute

Actually, to an audience such as this, there i s very little that I can add about the nature of the energy crisis or energy dilemma that we face. I think we all know what the problems are. So, I would like to direct my remarks to what nuclear energy can do to help in solving these problems, or to put it somewhat more colorfully , can nuclear take the heat off oil ?Today, there , is a growing consensus that nuclear power is destined to play a greatlyexpandedrole in the nation's future energy economy. Naturally, as a spokesman for Gulf's nuclear activities , I confess that I find this Consensus to be an agreeable one!But there are still some very real problems ahead which will determine how fast nuclear power can be accelerated in the United States -- problems which require attention now, if this new energy source is to assume its full share of the load in the years to come.So today, I will try to present a brief overview of the present status of nuclear energy; what the prospects are for increasing its use; and what future technological developments we can foresee, since some of them can have a major bearing on our energy economy of tomorrow. I will also touch upon some of the potentially attractive applications of generating process heat with nuclear fuel that could turn out to be of real help in increasing our domestic supplies, of oil and gas.We should begin by first looking a t our total energy needs. We are all, aware of the tremendous growth in demand that is forecast between now and the year 2000. But what is significant about this growth trend is that the production of electricity is the fastest growing use of energy.The recent report on U.S. -Energy Outlook by the National Petroleum Council estimated, that between 1972 and 1985, t o t a l U.S. energy consumption will grow at a rate of at least 4.2% a year, and between 1985 and 2000, the forecasters tell us that this growth will continue at only a slightly reduced rate .But let's take a look at where this energy is being consumed. Industry today is the biggest user, accounting for about a third of the total , and electricity consumption comes next with about a quarter. Transportation also represents about a quarter, and finally , residential uses -- principally home heating -- account- for about 14% of the total demand.At the same time, it is important to note that this mix of energy consumption is changing and will continue to do so while the total demand goes up. In particular, the demand for energy in the form of electricity is growing at an annual rate about twice that of energy demand as a whole.",,American Petroleum Institute

We have been told at one time or another that we have a productivity crisis , an urban crisis , a monetary crisis , an environmental crisis , a constitutional crisis -- even a physical fitness crisis . The word has become so clich&eacute;d that it has lost its original meaning as a turning point in a life and death situation .When dealing with the worsening symptoms of the energy crisis, however, - we may be getting back to the real meaning of the word. As energy expert James Akins, currently on assignment to the White House, observed recently in the quarterly review, Foreign Affairs: The oil crisis a reality ... No one has been crying wolf without reason. ..This time the wolf is here. It, of course, takes no crystal - ball gazer to detect the signs of trouble confronting the energy industry. Gone beyond recall are the days when we could expect complete energy self-sufficiency. We imported 12 percent of our energy in 1970, but by 1985, we shall be relying on foreign sources for as much as twice that percentage. The fuel import bill will rise accordingly -- to perhaps $20 billion a year by 1985 in contrast to $2 billion a year at the beginning of this decade.The events of this last winter showed that it is already later than you think. In various parts of the country, heating oil had to be rationed by the supplier last winter. Here and there, a factory or a school system had to close down for want of fuel. The transportation network -- whether by air, road, rail or water -- was endangered. Natural gas, under firm as well as interruptible contracts, suddenly became unavailable to various large consumers.Clearly, we cannot blame exceptional conditions for these exceptional hardships. This past winter was not unusually harsh. Since January, we have had no serious floods or earthquakes -- not even any air raids. We must conclude that we are living in times when normal conditions produce abnormal energy problems .The nature of these problems has, until now, been obscured by the extraordinary growth of world trade -- particularly of energy trade. This year, we shall import some six million barrels a day of petroleum. I still remember the arguments, not too many years ago, over the likely volume of oil imports in 1980. We were among those who agonized over whether it could by then be as high as five million barrels a day.In case you think we were very naive in our view of the import outlook, let me draw your attention to a painstaking survey. It was published in 1968 by the Department of the Interior to examine our petroleum prospects through 1980. It concluded that the remaining petroleum resources of the United States were more than adequate to support American consumption for many years into the future.",,American Petroleum Institute

After 1985, nuclear power and energy from the sun, the deep earth , the winds and tides will without much doubt become much more important than they are today. Sometime between 1985, and 1990 energy from these sources may even represent most of thegrowthin demand. It is unlikely that they will start todisplacehydrocarbons as primary sources of energy before the end of the century. In other words, not before the year 2000 can we expect theabsoluteconsumption of conventional hydrocarbons in the world to level off and start to decline.These dates are of course speculative. New methods of discovering hydrocarbons; new methods of drilling in deep water or breakthroughs in recovery methods could extend for several years, perhaps decades, the period of hydrocarbon dominance of energy in the world. Similarly, nuclear fusion may not be developed by the end of this century; there may be unforeseen problems in developing breeder reactors ; geothermal energy may prove to be unfeasible and we may not develop coal or shale on any substantial scale . The failure of any or all of these new processes could also extend the period of hydrocarbon dominations; although this would imply that energy supplies would be inadequate to meet future demands, or more accurately stated , that the cost or price of hydrocarbons would rise to the point where demand would be inhibited.Conversely, a breakthrough in development of nuclear fusion or new methods of in situ retorting of shale or of mining and converting coal could cut short the primacy of oil and gas. The picture could also change drastically, and in an entirely different manner if the main oil producers were to decide that it were in their interest to restrain growth. This is a process which has already been begun and will surely be one of the most important factors in international energy in the next two or three decades. There are, most likely, adequate supplies of petroleum and natural gas n the world to meet the world's demands and there might not be cause for concern if they were all located in areas of heavy consumption, or even if they were evenly distributed throughout the world. They are not, however, and is at last widely (but, still far from universally) recognized that the world's primary hydrocarbon reserves are concentrated in areas with small populations, with limited possibility for economic development, and whose demands for capital are limited. We cannot be sure that these producing countries will automatically find it to their own interest to expand production without restraint .It is almost axiomatic that an adequate supply of energy, at reasonable prices is in the interest of the world -- and this would include the oil producing countries as well.",,American Petroleum Institute

Swaim(Continental Oil Company),,,,,,API-74-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the personnel development climate and four of the concepts which are used in conducting personnel development in the Production Department of Continental Oil Company More than four methods are used in personnel development activities, but these four have been selected for discussion as they may be somewhat unique when compared to the standard classroom textbook mode of instruction.ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATEThere is no disputing the fact that reorganization is a way of life. Reorganizations can fall in to any number of categories, the most common of which can be classified as either necessary or unnecessary . A subsequent end result might be called successful or unsuccessful . Perhaps a good description of what takes place in some reorganizations would be: When things are going wrong, and you just feel the need to do something--hoping to straighten out the situation--REORGANIZE. The resulting state of confusion can present pseudo-illusions of progress and efficiency. This in itself helps to mask the true situation and makes it possible to postpone appropriate and needed action. Successful companies implement changes as needed to solve specific definable organizational problems. Occasionally the need for major changes becomes apparent. Such changes have been made by the Production Department of Continental Oil Company since 1958. The type of training climate now in existence in our department was made possible and necessary by these changes. Before discussing the four personnel development concepts for which this paper was prepared, a brief resume of these organizational changes will be presented. This inclusion is designed to furnish a better understanding of the circumstances which led to the establishment of our training climate. Organizational climate and personnel development climate should complement each other. A discussion of the latter would not be meaningful without the inclusion of such background material.Figure 1 reflects the number and location of operating offices in the domestic Production Department of our company in 1958 superposed on 1973 organizational boundaries. At that time, there was a total of sixty operating and supervisory offices including the headquarters office. Several changes were made from 1958 through 1966, but a major organizational change was made in 1967. The organizational offices established at that time were the same as now exist. Figure 2 reflects their locations. The reorganizations through 1967 reduced the number of domestic Production Department operating offices to eleven including the headquarters office. This amounted to forty-nine fewer offices than were in existence in 1958.Even prior to 1967 some of the responsibilities and associated authorities of higher offices were assigned to lower level offices. It became evident that these responsibilities were being accepted in a responsible manner, and the delegated authority was being used wisely. Then as division offices were eliminated, authorities previously assigned those offices were delegated to district offices.",,American Petroleum Institute

Trotter(Phillips Petroleum Co.),,,,,,API-74-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"Gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to be here and we certainly appreciate this opportunity to appear before the Division of Production of the API.My subject today is the Ekofisk Tank. As many of you know, this is a 1,000,000 barrel concrete tank structure which was constructed in one of the deep, sheltered fjords of southwestern Norway and was towed after completion to its location in the Ekofisk Field in the Norwegian North Sea. In many respects this project was a pioneering venture and we believe it probably fore-tells the future for permanent offshore structures in the North Sea, particularly as we drill in deeper and deeper waters.One of the problems we have faced in trying to describe this project is one of scale--we find that, although we can describe this structure as a cube with dimensions of a standard city block , most people don't really grasp the scale of the structure until they have a standard of comparison. For this reason our presentation today is a visual one; we will present a series of illustrations and photographs explaining the project and wi11 furnish a running commentary with each one.Illustration No. 1, North Sea MapThis map shows the location of the Ekofisk Field in Norwegian waters in the approximate center of the North Sea. The white lines are the concession boundaries, with British waters on the left, Norwegian, Danish, German and Dutch waters on the right.The Phillips Group drilled their first producer in this field in 1968; by 1970 we had drilled and completed 4 wells in the structure and had completed development plans for initial production from these 4 wells.Illustration No. 2, Production Phase IThis illustration shows the initial production system which was placed in operation in 1971 and which we called Phase I of field development. The 4 wells were completed on the sea-floor in 230 feet of water and produce through 4 flow lines to a jack-up rig which has been refitted with separation and other production equipment. We have found that we can produce 40,000 to 45,000 BOPD with this system; the GOR is about 1500 and the gas is flared at the rig mast.Although this production system has produced over 26 MM barrels of oil so far, it has one serious disadvantage, which is inherent in offshore tanker loading, and that is the inability to load oil when the sea is too rough for the tankers to remain at the buoys.Illustration No. 3. Production Phase IIEven before Ekofisk production was started we had designed and started work on the Phase II, or permanent, development plan which is shown here. The basis of this plan was to be able to produce 300,000 BOPD; to inject the produced gas back into the reservoir; and to continue offshore tanker loading--with one important difference.",,American Petroleum Institute

A.),,,,,,API-74-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"Exxon Company, U.S.A. proposes to install an offshore platform In 850 feet of water on federal lease OCS P-0188 of the Santa Barbara Channel, This location is 25 miles west of the city of Santa Barbara and is generally referred to as the Santa Ynez Unit. A map of this location is shown in Figure 1. We believe that we have an offshore platform well-suited for development of these deepwater leases. Insofar as possible, our proposed platform will incorporate features that we have successfully used in the Gulf of Mexico where we have operated for more than 25 years. Construction techniques to be used are an extension of existing contractor capabilities and will provide a platform in this greater water depth without the need for new methods or equipment. The platform will be one of integrated activity with drilling and producing activities combined with living quarters on a single platform.Design of the platform was carried out by Exxon and its research affiliate, Esso Production Research Company. Computer programs used in the analysis were developed by the Research Company. The platform as designed will satisfy three principal conditions:It will withstand the most severe loads that might occur during transport and during installation.It will withstand the loads that might be caused by severe storms or maximum earthquakes anticipated in the area.It will perform safely the combined functions of a drilling and producing facility.GEOMETRYElevation views of the platform are shown in Figure 2. Eight main legs framed with X and diagonal bracing and appropriate geometric bracing comprise the basic structural frame. This bracing system provides a high level of redundancy and adds substantially to the safety of the platform under severe earthquake or wave loading. The platform is founded into the ocean bottom with twenty 48-inch and 54-inch diameter piles. The piles are attached to the platform frame by either welding or grouting or both. The deck of the platform provides sufficient space and load capacity for drilling equipment, production facilities, quarters, and 28 well conductors.EARTHOUAKE DESIGN CRITERIAAn offshore platform for the Santa Ynez Unit requires that the platform be designed for an earthquake environment appropriate for the region, The following requirements have been satisfied in the design.Structural damage must be avoided in the event of ground shaking for which there is a significant probability of occurrence during the life of the structure.Safety against collapse must be provided in the event of strongest potential ground shaking.Structure must have sufficient ductility to undergo plastic straining without loss of structural integrity. (This condition insures ductile behavior well into the yielding range.)These criteria are recommended by Dr. G. W. Housner and Dr. P, C. Jennings of the California Institute of Technology. Their report describes in detail the response spectra and recommends the general approach to earthquake-resistant design used in the design of this platform.",,American Petroleum Institute

Brill(University of Tulsa),,,,,,API-74-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"Newly formed API Offshore Safety and Anti-Pollution Committees have established standards, written recommended practices, and funded research projects to improve the reliability of velocity-type subsurface safety valves. These valves are used extensively in offshore production wells to automatically shut off flow of well fluids below the mud line under emergency conditions. New standards have been written to assure minimum performance levels and provide for functional testing of each safety valve. The recommended practices include the use of an API computer program for slang the valve internals to actuate closure at a predetermined well production rate.Research activities funded by API include The University of Tulsa project. This project will improve present capabilities of predicting the multiphase gas-liquid flow phenomena which cause the valves to close. Flow testing of simulated valves and chokes with air-water mixtures at high pressure will be performed. Data obtained will be used to develop new correlations or to verify existing correlations now used in the API valve sizing computer program. The new research results, together with the newly established API standards will improve the reliability of these valves.INTRODUCTIONSubsurface safety valves (SSSVs) are required by law in most offshore producing wells and are one of many devices available for well fluid containment. The purpose of the valves is to shut off well flow In the production tubing below the mudline in the event disasters, such as explosions or fires, disable surface shutdown devices. Several types of SSSVs are used, including those which are controlled from the surface by hydraulic fluids, pressure sensing valves, and differential pressure or fluid velocity actuated valves. This paper deals primarily with the velocity-type valve.Actuation of the velocity-type is based on a simple force balance principle. Loss of pressure above a valve increases the flow rate through the valve and also the pressure loss across the valve. For subcritical flow, the pressure loss across a restriction, such as the choke used in a safety valve, is proportional to the flow rate of fluids . The safety valve is held open by a spring whose force is greater than the opposing resultant well fluid forces generated by normal production rate. However, for higher than normal production rates corresponding to loss of tubing head back-pressure, the net well fluid forces become great enough to overcome the spring forces and to actuate valve closure.Before recent API safety valve standards were written, functional testing procedures and selection of manufacturing tolerances on critical valve components were left to the discretion of valve manufacturers. New API standards and recommended practices have been written by the API Committee on Standardization of Offshore Safety and Anti-Pollution Equipment (OSAPE). These documents provide manufacturing tolerances and a formal procedure for functional and performance testing.Current recommendations for valve type and spring and choke size for each well condition are made using technology based on single phase flow theory. Since most valves operate under gas-liquid flow conditions, the development of improved multiphase flow prediction was recognized as a high potential area for safety valve improvement.",,American Petroleum Institute
824,321357,,Three Years Of Field Experience With Sand Erosion Probes,R.D. Swam(Exxon Company U. S. A.)|C.M. Reimer(Exxon Company U. S. A.),,,,,,API-74-E001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"Sand probes have proven to be a reliable means of detecting sand production from oil and gas wells and activating surface shut-in equipment. The probes, which are thin walled, hollow steel cylinders with a closed end, are installed perpendicular to flow in the flowline and connected to a pilot valve. When the wall of the probe has been penetrated by sand erosion, flow stream pressure is transferred to a pilot valve which effects closure of the safety valve on the Xmas tree. Based on the successful results of both laboratory and field tests, Exxon had installed sand probes on all of its Offshore Louisiana wells by January 1, 1973. Field experience to date has shown that the probes will successfully shut in wells before flowline equipment damage can occur, in addition to providing an increase in safety and a decrease in pollution risk, the use of probes has significantly reduced the costs associated with equipment failures due to sand erosion, The data obtained from sand probes is also used analytically to evaluate precautionary sand control workovers.INTRODUCTIONEquipment or flowline erosion caused by produced sand has long been a major operating problem in many areas, both in terms of cost of equipment replacement and in terms of the risk of pollution and/or fire caused by flowline or equipment cutouts. While it is obvious that a dependable, long-lasting sand control workover procedure would be the best solution to this problem, such a procedure has yet to be attained, and a method of detecting produced sand prior to well sandup or equipment cutout is necessary.Until the development of sand probes, the foremost obstacle in the path of controlling sand erosion was the fact that there was no continuous, 'on-stream way to detect the erosion of flowlines or equipment until a cutout actually occurred. The occasional detection of sand production by shakeout was not particularly helpful, as this gave no indication of how much, if any, damage had already been done. Ultrasonic and radiographic inspection are expensive and only indicate damage already done. What was really needed was a device which would detect the presence of sand as it was being produced and then provide some type of an output signal so that appropriate measures could be taken to prevent equipment failure. The sand probe satisfies these requirements.This paper first describes the sand probe and its operation, laboratory and field testing of sand probes, full-scale field installations, and the reporting system used to keep both operations and engineering personnel informed of sand probe status on each well. Evidence is then presented to demonstrate the success achieved through use of the sand probe as a safety device, and finally, the use of the sand probe as an analytical tool is discussed.DESCRIPTIONThe sand probe (Figure1) is a hollow stainless steel cylinder, plugged at one end, which is inserted into a flowstream with the open end protruding from the wall of the pipe (Figure 2).",,American Petroleum Institute

Hammet(SEDCO Inc.),,,,,,API-74-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 24-27 March, New Orleans, Louisiana",1974,"This paper reviews the characteristics which enabled the SEDCO 445 to drill without anchors in water depths of 1,350 feet and with the objective water depth of 6,000 feet. Specifically, it reviews the design and operating experience gained with the unit's dynamic stationing equipment, the BOP control equipment, the re-entry equipment and the marine riser buoyancy material. Further, it reviews the steps that were taken in developing the vessel and its equipment and what has been achieved since it began operations in late 1971.INTRODUCTIONIn early 1970, SEDCO, in conjunction with Shell International Petroleum, began to develop a new generation drilling vessel that could operate without anchors-- the SEDCO 445 (Figs. 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, and 1-D) . During the ensuing four-year period, this concept has become a reality and today the technology and equipment is available to conduct exploration drilling operations with complete well control at seabed in water depths beyond 2,000 feet without anchors or guidelines. Prior to 1970, several coring vessels, including the Eureka, Caldrill and Glomar Challenger, were using an elementary form of dynamic positioning by holding the ship over a designated area. Propulsion equipment linked to a master control center provided the stationing capability to counter the wind, wave and current actions acting on the ship. In contrast, the SEDCO 445 made a major technological step in stationing systems by providing a much more reliable and accurate system to safely conduct exploration drilling activities. Reliability plus accuracy were achieved via rigorous engineering and the provision of 100 per cent back up on all station keeping equipment. In addition to the dynamic stationing capabilities, SEDCO also had to provide a blow-out prevention system that would operate in these increased water depths. This meant providing a re-entry system so guidelines could be eliminated, an advanced BOP control system and a marine riser system which could operate in excess of 1,500 feet of water. In the following portions of this paper, four major technological problems and their solutions are presented.Dynamic StationingWellhead Re-entry Without GuidelinesBOP Controls for over 1,500 Foot Water DepthsMarine Riser SystemsDYNAMIC STATIONINGGeneralDynamic stationing is the technology of maintaining a vessel's position by means of thrust. The SEDCO 445 achieves this with eleven thrusters and the ship's main propulsion system which are linked to a highly advanced computer network. The dynamic stationing system is made up of two major parts--first, the automatic station keeping (ASK) system which accurately detects the vessel's position relative to a fixed point on the ocean floor, commanding the second part of the system, a series of thrusters and main propellers, that provide the thrust necessary to counteract the effects of wind and seas. Both parts of the system are fully redundant and are composed of thoroughly tested and reliable components.The SEDCO 445, when dynamically stationed without anchors, has complete , freedom to head into prevailing wind, waves or currents thereby reducing the size thrust necessary to hold the vessel on station and also improving the ship's motion characteristics.",,American Petroleum Institute

Whether we term the energy mess a crisis , a problem , or a challenge , to every American who has had to wait hours in line to fill his car?s gas tank, it is a real pain in the neck.The energy crisis affects so many of us directly and profoundly. Practically everything we eat or use depends on energy. Energy means jobs, food and warmth in winter and air-conditioning in summer. The energy crisis is with us today; it is real, and it is likely to be with us for quite some time. It was not invented by the oil companies, the politicians in Washington, or the devil himself. The basic cause is bad government policy, and the independent oil companies have been right every step of the way in pointing that out.I have long warned that the policies of the Federal government were leading us to this energy crunch. As far back as 1953, I was making speeches saying that it would be a very bad mistake for this government to let itself get in a position where we had to rely on other countries for our fuel. Today I find little satisfaction that warnings I made ten or fifteen years ago are coming true. In 1973, our foreign petroleum imports totaled 6.2 million barrels per day, accounting for 35 per cent of our total oil consumption. The imports in 1973 were valued a t $9.3 billion. It is a shocking fact that if we imported only the same quantity of oil imports in 1974 as we did in 1973, it would cost us $25 billion, or almost $16 billion more.We have simply put ourselves into a situation where we are at the mercy of the countries who have their hands on the spigot. Unlike Europe and Japan who do not have appreciable energy resources, our overdependence has been the result of poor planning and blind government policies.In the interest of the consumer, the Federal Power Commission rigidly controlled prices of natural gas in interstate commerce; the environmentalists held up the Alaskan pipeline for five years, prevented the drilling of offshore lands by holding back on leasing, and thwarted the establishment of refineries. Even now, I read where the State of New Hampshire has refused to allow a refinery to be built there. They want the best of all worlds--cheap oil, no refineries, and a guaranteed source of supply. That is a dream world. They want Louisiana and Texas to have the refineries to produce clean and cheap fuel for their industries and homes. But, then they want to tax the pants off the industry so that there are no excess profits , as they define the term. You don't see New Englanders complain about excess profits of industries located in their states.",,American Petroleum Institute

Twelve programs have been completed which represents 164.5 hours of training. There are twenty-seven units in the twelve programs. These programs form the basis for the API Certificate of Achievement Program. As of January 1, 1974, 329 employees in the producing segment of the Industry had completed fifty or more hours of programmed learning in this activity. This represents 26,350 man hours of training in the programmed learning mode for 329 employees. There are many others in the program who have not completed the initial fifty hours. Those companies who have a significant number of employees participating are Atlantic Richfield, Cities Service, Mobi1 Research and Development, Shell, and Texas Pacific.John Payne, Chairman of the API-GPA Subcommittee on Slide-Tapes, reports that there are over one hundred slide-tape programs pertaining to producing and gas plant operations. These, as are the PROFIT Series programs, are directed at the field operators level. John advises that there are thirty programs that are presently available to these two segments of the industry. If the forty-seven Shell programs are purchased by the API, over seventy-five different programs will be available to the industry. John further advises that although these forty-seven were produced primarily for offshore operations, about three-quarters of those can be used industry wide.These slide-tapes can be used by any local supervisor as an aid in discussing operation, care and maintenance of equipment. My company uses slide-tape programs in four different ways. First, they are excellent when used in connection with orienting new employees, or those who are not familiar with field operations. Participants are able to learn some of the jargon needed to communicate effectively with field personnel as well as general information on equipment and its operation. Second, these programs are used by team leaders, in discussing operating techniques and problems of a timely nature. Field response to these programs is excellent. Third, these slide - tapes are used during the formal presentation of courses to company personnel. Fourth, some of these will eventually be converted to slide-tape programmed learning programs which will be used in a synergistic team problem-solving mode of instruction.I would now like to present some testimony as to the value of specific programmed learning and slide-tape programs. A college professor wrote RDC an unsolicited letter stating that PROFIT Oil and Gas reservoir was one of the finest pieces of programmed learning he had ever seen. He stated he was using it to supplement a geology course he was conducting for school teachers attending summer school.",,American Petroleum Institute

Langston(Exxon Company U.S.A.),,,,,,API-75-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"IntroductionTraining of drilling crews is assuming a sharply increased importance that will continue into the foreseeable future. This new emphasis is caused by a number of factors. The most important among them are the increasing complexity of drilling operations, a large increase in cost- -particularly offshore, and the critical shortage of trained people at a time of rapid expansion in total rigs. A new and substantially increased effort is needed to keep pace with changing technology and the demands of the social climate in which we work. The new training required is the joint responsibility of the operator, the contractor, and industry organizations. Its cost will be repaid many fold through improved efficiency, improved safety, and a further reduction in major contingencies. The discussion to follow outlines the need for new training, presents efforts in response to the need, and shows the benefits of increased training to our industry and to our society. A charge is issued to the API and to all of us in industry to initiate a formal program to meet this training need.Expanding NeedThe expanded need for training comes from the triple factors of a large number of new rigs, a decrease in experienced people, and increased technological challenge at the wellsite.lOf course, each of these factors have several facets, some of which are related only through the broader aspect of our responsibility as a good citizen. This could be illustrated by the balance which must be maintained between cost and efficiency on the one hand and operational precautions on the other. Though the rules governing this balance are not written on the rig floor, it is on the rig floor where they are made to work or fail.The increase in the number of rigs expected to be operating in the U.S.A. is shown on Figure 1.2This figure shows the total for rigs of all types. The shaded area was added to the data in the reference and represents an estimate based on the range in published predictions. The steady climb since1971 has already placed a severe load on available experienced personnel. As our effort toward national energy independence gathers momentum, the number of rigs must continue to grow. During the eighty years between 1970 and 1978, they will have doubled. This is not the complete picture, though because many of the new rigs will be on the deeper complex wells and some (possibly 120) will be larger mobile rigs for service in offshore U.S.A. Every factor we consider tells us the need for a skilled employee trained in their job is going t o reach a new high.We can no longer place our major emphasis on on-the-job training. This has served us well in the past and will continue to be important in the future. We cannot wait, however, for the new personnel to be trained by the slow process of experience alone. Our need is now.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hamby(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-75-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"INTRODUCTIONDeep geological horizons offer at least one potential source for oil and gas supplies so urgently needed for the world market. The industry has been interested in deep prospects for many years as demonstrated by the increase in deep well drilling activity during the 1950's and 1960's. In 1974, 446 wells costing more than $650 million were drilled to depths in excess of 15,000 feet, and 65 of these were drilled deeper than 20,000 feet at a cost of $170 mi1lion.lDeep well programs are underway in the various parts of the United States Canada,2-5Southern France, Northern Italy, Germany, Austria, and Russia.6-9Deep wells in the past have encountered pressures in excess of 22,000 psi, temperatures above 550 F, acid gases, saltwater, and sulfur. These factors create very hostile environments that challenge available equipment and technology and significantly increase already spiraling well costs.The drilling segment of the industry has demonstrated the capability of drilling below 30,000 feet by setting a new depth record o 31,441 feet during 1974 in Lone Star Producing Company's Bertha Rogers No. 1.10Wells of this type are not drilled without considerable difficulty and expense, especially when hydrogen sulfide is encountered.Drilling and production experience with the very high pressured (greater than 15,000 psi bottom hole pressure) deep sour gas is somewhat limited within the industry , the most notable example being Shell's activity in the Thomasville, Southwest Piney Woods and Piney Woods fields in Mississippi.11-15Prior to the discovery of the Thomasville field In 1969, sustained production of high pressure sour gas had not been proven beyond a short test by Phillips Petroleum Company in their Josephine A well.16The 13,830 psi bottom hole pressure encountered in this well was considerably below the 17,500 psi found at Thomasville. Shell's production experience spans a two and one half year period during which some very difficult completion and production problems have been resolved. Of particular interest is the Ridgway Management No. 1 well in the Southwest Piney Woods field. Completion of this well was deferred over two years in order to obtain thick wall sulfide cracking resistant casing, a 30,000 psi working pressure wellhead, and other equipment necessary to handle the expected high pressures and corrosive production.The technology and equipment for meeting the challenge of these adverse producing environments are being developed as the environments become defined. As more companies have become involved the pace of development has been increasing. Extreme care must now and always be taken in the design, materials selection, and above all, quality control for equipment to be used in high pressure sour service.DEEP MISSISSIPPI PRODUCING ENVIRONMENTThe wells in the Thomasville, Piney Woods, and Southwest Piney Woods fields are completed in the Smackover formation between 19,700-22,250 feet.",,American Petroleum Institute

Chennault(Oilwell Division United States Steel Corporation),,,,,,API-75-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"It's a great privilege for a representative of United States Steel to be invited to your important conference today. Our industries have a lot in common. We both got started in the 1850's. We're both very capital intensive. We've both learned something about nationalization in Venezuela, and without question, we absolutely depend upon one another.Steel is in the oil and gas picture all the way from drilling to pumping gasoline into motorists' tanks. Steel production on the other hand uses tremendous amounts of energy -- much of it coming from oil and gas.That's why I've called this talk ''Steel and Oil -- Partners in Production . It's important that we put some current focus on this inter-relationship.As President of my company's Oilwell Division -- an outfit which supplies many of your needs -- I'm in a unique position to be responsive to the inter-relationship of steel and oil.One of my jobs is to advise my bosses as to what your needs will be, short and long-term and to see they are met to the best of our ability.Our relationship really began in 1859 when the first American oil well was drilled to 59 feet. My colleagues in Pittsburgh observe that 59 feet is only a pretty good gain by Franco Harris of the Super Bowl IX Pittsburgh Steelers. Since then your industry, with the support of the steel industry and a11 of your suppliers, has drilled almost 2.4 million wells in our country with the greatest well depth exceeding 30,000 feet.The dialogue between the production people of the petroleum industry and the steel industry has waxed and waned with the surges and declines in your activity and the availability of steel. From the perspective of a man with a variety of oil field equipment and some joints of pipe for a very demanding market, I admit there has been much more waxing of the dialogue over the past 18-24 months. This is in sharp contrast to what we previously experienced in the fifteen-year decline in domestic drilling activity.This is understandable! And, it is also healthy. Two-way communications between the members of our two industries are essential in producing steel, equipment, and services that oil and gas people need.Let's talk about the current steel situation and the prospects for the longer-term.The year 1974 was somewhat paradoxical for the steel industry. Shipments to the largest regular purchaser of steel from the mills, the automotive industry, were off about 25 percent from 1973. This, along with softness in appliances and residential and light commercial construction would have suggested possibly that steel would be fairly available. However, supply remained tight, reflecting great strength in the steel intensive capital goods market. One of the sustaining elements of the 1974 steel market was the tremendous demand from the oil and gas industry and other energy-related markets.",,American Petroleum Institute

Bond(Atlantic Richfield Co. ornia),,,,,,API-75-G001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"INTRODUCTIONGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen. As the title of my presentation suggests, I've been given a very large piece of ground to cover in this wrap-up session, In the course of my discussion, I will be touching on oil shale, coal gasification and liquefaction, tar sands and heavy oils, solar energy, geothermal energy, and enhanced recovery techniques. After one reflects a moment on these topics, I might well have said I was going to cover some blue sky in addition to a lot of ground. However, embodied in these topics are tremendous potential energy resources which deserve examination for possible contribution to our future energy supply. As a matter of fact, the potential of these resources is not really a question to most observers. People generally acknowledge that we have billions of tons of coal, mountains of oil shale, millions of acres of partially depleted oil and gas fields, an earth with a molten center, and a sun that never goes dark.The question is -- when will the potential of these energy sources be tapped to an extent to significantly assist and augment our conventional energy supplies. Naturally, we have looked to our forecasters and soothsayers over the years to answer this question. When it comes time to do a post mortem on their predictions, we find a great commonality. The forecasts have rather consistently said that these resources will be developed more rapidly, and to a greater extent, than has actually been realized.The newest crop of energy forecasters was recently assembled under the Federal Energy Administration. Their predictions have been summarized in a massive report entitled Project Independence Report . Despite much analysis, these new forecasts of the potential of synthetics, under business As Usual and Accelerated Development scenarios, share the same over optimism of earlier, less sophisticated forecasts.In our view the Report is consistently optimistic in projecting both the magnitude and the timing of supplemental energy resource development. Where capital figures are presented, they seem consistently understated. For example, in the case of shale oil, the Report estimate is at best 60% of our own recent estimate. These low capital projections, plus assumptions that existing tax laws will not be changed call into question one of the Report's major conclusions that the oil industry will be able to finance internally all of its investment requirements and still have additional funds to assist other energy projects outside the oil and gas industry .Our pessimism has been fanned by the developments which occurred in the last half of 1974. The progress toward synthetic fuel commercialization unquestionably suffered a severe setback. Shell Explorer Limited, a wholly owned Shell subsidiary, announced it was discontinuing efforts to participate in the building and operation of a 100,000 BPCD oil sands plant in Alberta. Syncrude Canada Ltd. temporarily halted construction of its 125,000 BPCD oil sands plant when Atlantic Richfield Canada withdrew. The project is now going forward only because of the infusion of massive government funds.",,American Petroleum Institute

Brill(The University of Tulsa),,,,,,API-75-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"A research project on multiphase fluid flow at The University of Tulsa is sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, Division of Production, to improve the reliability of using velocity-type subsurface safety valves for emergency well fluid containment in offshore producing wells. The research results will give improved prediction methods for estimating both the well production rates which are necessary to close the flow-controlled valves (closing rates) and also pressure drops across the valves for different well conditions. The project was initiated by request of the API Committee on Offshore Safety and Anti-pollution Research in June, 1973, and is scheduled for completion in late 1975. Initial activity of the API Advisory Committee and University research staff concentrated on project planning and building the experimental flow system. Preliminary full-scale flow tests using the completed high-capacity, high-pressure flow system have been performed on chokes and simulated safety valve flow channel geometries. The experimental data show the importance of multiphase flow phenomena for accurate closing rate prediction. The final data correlation will be incorporated into the API computer program used to select choke and spring sizes of velocity-type subsurface safety valves for individual producing wells.INTRODUCTIONSubsurface safety valves (SSSVs) are required by law in most offshore producing wells. The purpose of the valves is to shut off flow in the production tubing below the mudline in the event disasters, such as explosions or fires, disable surface shutdown devices.The velocity-type SSSV, which is a flow-controlled valve, is the most predominantly used subsurface safety valve today in the Gulf of Mexico. Even though the use of velocity type valves is decreasing as a result of governmental regulation, they will continue to be used in thousands of existing offshore wells for a number of years. Recognition of the continuing importance of velocity-type SSSVs to industry safety and anti-pollution efforts resulted in the BPI Committee on Offshore Safety and Anti-pollution Research (OSAPR) initiating and sponsoring the fluid flow research project at the University of Tulsa.The fluid flow research will give improved prediction methods used to select correct sizes of valve chokes and springs for specific well conditions so that the valve will close at a predetermined well fluid production rate. The consequences of incorrect valve sizing are either premature closures which result in lost production and operator expense or loss of protection from using a valve which cannot be closed by well flow rates corresponding to disaster conditions.EARLY PROJECT PLANNINGInitial efforts in the research program began in 1973 to compile all applicable industry information on velocity type SSVs which could be of use in planning the experimental program. Several meetings were held between University staff and representatives of numerous offshore operators and valve manufacturers. A Project Advisory Committee made up of four industry representatives knowledgeable in fluid flow was appointed to provide continuous industry guidance to the University research staff. Statistical information on Gulf of Mexico SSSV usage developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was also reviewed to determine testing priorities.",,American Petroleum Institute
833,321366,,Probabilistic Methods For Offshore Platforms,Bernhard Stahl(Amoco Production Company),,,,,,API-75-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"This paper presents a brief overview and introduction to application of probabilistic methods for offshore platforms. Probability distributions for platform loading and resistance are described, and woven together to calculate platform reliability, which is expressed as theprobabilitythat the platform will serve its function without failure. It is shown how reliability analysis, in conjunction with economic value analysis, can be very valuable in evolving platform design criteria. Minimization of total expected platform costs, including expected losses, is suggested as a rational approach to criteria selection. An example problem is provided which illustrates the concept.The conventionalsafetyfactor is shown to provide insufficient information to assess structural integrity and to define rational design criteria; the variabilities of the design parameters must be estimated. A discussion of calibration methods is provided which would permit the in-service field experience of platform 11 proof tests during severe storms to be incorporated in the design process. The paper provides a list of benefits to be derived from platform reliability analysis, and outlines a possible industry program for further utilization of probabilistic methods for offshore platforms.INTRODUCTIONThe concepts of structural safety and risk of failure have been expressed years ago. As early as 1924 Swedish Professor Carl Forsell, in an article entitled Economy and Construction translated by N. C. Lind [1]**, discussed what exaggerated protection against real or imagined risks can cost. The article stresses the need to balance the requirements of safety against considerations of economy. Professor Forsell implied the principle of rational structural design for the first time. Lind stated this principle in modern terminology as follows: A structure should be proportioned to maximize its contribution to the owner's utility, including the expected losses. This principle is as true today as it was half a century ago. It is this principle which challenges the structural engineer to use methods of reliability analysis to design economically optimum structures. The present paper is written with this basic principle in mind.Applications of reliability analysis techniques to complex engineering problems are rapidly becoming widespread as more and more engineers begin to recognize the importance and rationale of this approach. Although concepts of reliability analysis have been advanced for many years, e .g. Freudenthal [2,3], it has been only within the last ten to fifteen years that a great deal of emphasis has been placed on application of probabilistic methods for structural analysis and design.A review of the important literature in this field has recently been completed by the ASCE Task Committee on Structural Safety [4]. A variety of applications of reliability analysis methods may be found in recent publications [5,6] and in the abstracts for the proceedings of a conference held recently at Stanford University [7].Risk problems offshore were first analyzed in a paper by Borgman [8]. With regard to reliability analysis of fixed offshore platforms specifically, the work by Marshall [9] represents the first effort in that direction. Later, Bea [10] applied platform reliability analysis to rational selection of environmental design criteria. At the same time, Stahl and Knapp [11] studied reliability analysis as a decision-making tool to evaluate the feasibility of structural remedial measures to improve platform reliability. In [12], Marshall and Bea further elaborated on reliability analysis methods and applications.",,American Petroleum Institute
834,321367,,Project Independent And The Role Of Oil And Gas,James R. Gill(Federal Energy Administration),,,,,,API-75-K001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you today about certain pertinent items relating to oil and gas production. I would first like to outline very briefly the program pro-posed by President Ford to achieve the goals of Project Independence and then discuss the two most significant items with respect to oil and gas production which are of particular interest right now: The changes in the depletion allowance and the recent industry announcements on our proved reserves. Finally, I will briefly mention some items of general interest regarding Government programs which affect production.The President's Energy ProgramThe President has prescribed tough action to cure our energy ills. He has outlined three, time-phased goals.One: In short term, a cut in our oil imports of 1 million barrels per day by the end of this year and 2 million barrels per day by the end of 1977.Two: By 1985, imports of no more than 3-5 million barrels per day-- and the capability of immediately replacing that amount from storage and standby measures in the event of a supply disruption, thus reducing our vulnerability to embargoes.Three: Over the long term, accelerated development of energy technology and resources so that the United States can meet a significant share of the energy needs of the free world by the end of this century, thus assuring both energy availability and its world price.In order to meet these goals, the President has proposed a comprehensive energy plan which-is basically aimed at increasing the price of energy in the U.S. The higher price would have a twofold effect on our overall energy picture: it would be a powerful incentive both to the conservation of energy and to increasing the supply of domestic energy. The rise in price would be shared by all forms of energy; thus, the burdens and benefits of the program would be evenly dispersed, rather than focused on specific energy forms or users.Many alternate energy programs have been suggested since the President's energy package was announced. Whereas, the Administration program affects the price of all forms of energy, several of the alternatives offered recently would price some forms of energy, such as motor gasoline, higher than the average price of energy. Still others would place limits on the price of certain energy forms, such as natural gas or coal, or would limit the quantity of petroleum imports. Placing limitations on imports would result in an artificially created shortage which must be managed through allocation or rationing programs, requiring large administrative bureaucracies. In summary, the program proposed by the President is based on a free enterprise philosophy with the price mechanism as the determiner of supply and demand. We believe that the increase in the price of energy, which the program entails, is adequate to provide for necessary conservation measures and increased production of domestic energy sources. At the same time, this program utilizes a minimum of Government controls and regulations, relying primarily on the free market system to accomplish our energy goals in as equitable a manner as possible.",,American Petroleum Institute
835,321368,,Impact Of Environmental Regulations On Development Of Energy Resources,Albert Fry(Environmental Protection Agency),,,,,,API-75-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"It seems reasonable to start by defining terms and reaching some agreement on what will or will not be discussed. Environment is an all inclusive word which includes not only clean air and clean water but lifestyle and standard of living. As a result, good environment means very different things to different groups. We can all agree that we want an environment which includes a strong economy and a healthy population with leisure opportunities for all. As soon as we attempt to become more specific we run into conflicting opinions and goals.First Point- The Federal government is not solely responsible for the environment or for environmental constraints. While the role of the Federal government in the environmental affairs has expanded greatly in the last decade, that role is still limited. The Federal establishment has very limited impact on energy facility sitting issues, no direct control over state and local governments which impose standards more stringent than national standards and virtually no control over private environmental organizations. We are not responsible for Ralph Nader or for the Sierra Club.Second Point- EPA is not solely responsible for Federal action concerning the environment, health, and safety. For example, OSHA is responsible for safety in the work place, MESA for mining safety, DOT for auto and highway safety, PHs and NIH for public health, and the Department of Commerce for coastal zone planning and management. All Federal agencies are required to prepare environmental impact statements for major actions and the Council on Environmental Quality is responsible for the administration of this EIS system under the provision of the National Environmental Protection Act of 1969. The Department of the Interior would be responsible for strip mine reclamation under the legislation which has now passed both houses of Congress.All of this is not intended as a cop out. EPA is still the one Federal agency most responsible for environmental protection. However, our charter and authorities are limited. On occasions EPA is criticized (and sometimes praised) for actions not of our doing. It is imminently reasonable to hold EPA responsible for its actions, it is unfair to blame the Federal government or EPA for problems generated by others in the name of improving the environment.Today I propose to discuss the impacts of EPA's regulatory program on the development of energy resources. I plan to give an overview of the impact of EPA's regulatory program by summarizing the results of a recent report to the Congress on this subject. Then I would like to address a series of specific program areas which I think are of interest to your organization and finally to close with a summary of my views on the tradeoffs between energy development and environmental protection.IIMPACTS OF EPA?S REGULATORY PROGRAM(Figure is available in full paper)Inflationary ImpactA study by Chase Econometrics indicates that our environmental program was responsible for 0.5% of the 17% increase in the wholesale price index for the year ending March 1974.",,American Petroleum Institute

It has been two years since I have had the pleasure of addressing an API audience in an open forum and believe me there has, at least as far as our University of Texas organization is concerned, been great strides in petroleum industry training. The energy crisis and the shortage of qualified personnel in the industry has everyone thinking about training as a partial answer and solution to greater productivity. This fact is affirmed by enrollment in our many schools. With very few exceptions, all schools scheduled for 1975 have reached full enrollment, and 1976 schools are filling rapidly. When a school has reached full enrollment we accept standby applicants because some cancellations do occur.With your indulgence, while talking about What's New in the API Sponsored Schools of Technology I'd also like to give you a feel for the organization with which we in the Petroleum Extension Service operate, a brief background on the API sponsored schools, old and new, and tell you a little about new schools that are operating for other trade associations.The headquarters for the Petroleum Extension Service is in Austin, Texas, on the main campus of the University of Texas. Our department is a branch of the Industrial and Business Training Bureau which in turn is one of four bureaus of the Division of Extension of the University. We have facilities and personnel at the University of Texas for writing of books and manuals, production of film and slide tapes, video tapes, and any other training materials used in the support of our technology training programs, individual company in-house programs and home study courses for individual participants. In addition to these services we have recently instituted a motion picture previewing service so that a film can be previewed by a potential purchaser. This service will be provided through the Visual Instruction Bureau of the Division of Extension. Since we believe the PETM is the logical agency for coordinating, producing, and distributing training materials for our own industry's needs, our small staff at the University is expertly geared to efficient production and rapid distribution of training media materials. Frequently we work through contractors to speed up production and reproduction of materials.Since the inception of PETEX involvement in petroleum industry technology training through the use of residential type schools, the courses have been conducted off campus of the University of Texas. Sites selected for this type of training were chosen for their proximity to heavy petroleum activity and in all cases have been located on the campuses of Junior Colleges. The three locations for PETEX training centers are Lee College at Baytown, Texas; Kilgore College at Kilgore, Texas; and Odessa College at Odessa, Texas. We have had outstanding cooperation from the administration staffs of all the colleges in providing facilities and support for our programs. At the present time there are five resident staff members for the Kilgore training center and two resident staff members for the Odessa center. Previously most personnel responsible for manning off campus PETM operated training centers operated from our Austin headquarters. This is the case now only for Lee College. The trend is therefore changing to having our personnel resident in the area where they are responsible for training programs.",,American Petroleum Institute
837,321370,,The Tension Leg Platform Concept,John H. Brever(Deep Oil Technology),,,,,,API-75-Q001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"It is a pleasure to be here today. I wish to thank the API for giving me this opportunity to present some information on one of the innovative projects being conducted by Deep Oil Technology.The subject of this presentation is the Tension Leg Platform concept. Though I will be talking about this unique type of offshore platform as a concept, I'm pleased to announce that the Tension Leg Platform has just emerged from the concept stage into the first fully operational Tension Leg Platform moored at sea.A prototype TLP, christened the Deep Oil X-1 , was successfully installed in 200' of water offshore Southern California. This prototype Tension Leg Platform was designed and built as a test platform supporting a complete array of instrumentation, on board, to measure the platform's response to environmental loadings. Several rather severe storms, by California standards, have occurred since installation and the Deep Oil X-1 has proven to be an exceptionally stable offshore platform in the presence of high wind and wave loadings. These tests are being sponsored by 17 oil companies.The Tension Leg Platform was conceived as a new approach to the problems presented by the oil industry' s ever-growing need to conduct drilling and producing operations in increasingly deeper water and hostile environments. It consists basically of a buoyant tubular structure anchored to the seafloor by taut, vertically-oriented cables. It is a hybrid between floating spread moored structures and fixed-bottom supported platforms.The concept embodies two unique features. The first is that the platform is held in place by the vertically-oriented tension cables. Since, at its operating draft, the platform's buoyancy exceeds its weight, the anchor cables remain in tension at all times. These tension legs prevent the platform from responding with any significant vertical motion such as roll, pitch, and heave and the tension legs act as a restoring or station-keeping force when weather causes the platform to surge, sway, and yaw (horizontal motion).The second unique feature is that the submerged cylinders are configured to minimize the platform's response to wave action. For example, as a wave crest passes through the platform, the associated water particle acceleration produces a downward force on the submerged horizontal cylinders, while the wave's crest increases the buoyancy of the vertical members producing an upward force. When the wave trough passes through the structure, the forces are reversed. By selecting the proper ratio of horizontal to vertical members, the resulting changes in anchor cable tension can be minimized.An important design consideration is the total static plus time-dependent load in the mooring cables. At any instant the total force in these cables includes the weight/buoyancy discrepancy, plus a time-varying component induced by a combination of the incident waves and the lateral motion of the platform. The analytical procedure developed to predict these forces is termed hydrodynamic synthesis . A complex structure is considered to be assembled from a group of similar bodies whose hydrodynamic properties are known.",,American Petroleum Institute

Eaton(National Bank of Tulsa),,,,,,API-75-R001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 7-9 April, Dallas, Texas",1975,"I come before you today with rather mixed feelings about what I'm going to say. Last fall, when I agreed to come to Dallas and try to answer the question as to where we were going to get the money to make our country energy self-sufficient by 1985, I was reasonably sure I knew the answer. Although the number is huge-- Chase Manhattan estimates it a t $850 billion over the next ten years--I was confident that our free enterprise system would indeed come up with the money. I was planning on saying some comforting things about the Wall Street and the overall economic outlook. It was obvious then that the money market was entering into the downside of a tight money cycle. Interest rates were falling, funds were coming back into the financial institutions, and the stock market had started a very strong rally. The world of money was returning to a more normal state. Yes, I was sure that our traditional financial institutions, the banks and the bond markets and the stock market, would be able to do the job.Well, gentlemen, frankly, I must say today that I am no longer sure of those answers. The return to stable interest rates and a stable economy does not seem as close at hand as I believed only a few months ago. What has sounded the alarm is the fiscal program that is being politically forced on the country by our Congress. All of us in the money business are greatly concerned that these programs will put us right back on the roller coaster of double-digit inflation and double digit interest rates.To understand our fear, it is necessary to go back and review our recent economic history and particularly the role of inflation and its causes. In simple terms, inflation is the direct result of policies where the government spends more than it taxes and prints money to make up part of the deficit. We have had five major inflations in our history: the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War II, and, lastly, the Vietnam War. The common denominator is abundantly clear--war. During a national crisis, the government takes control of the economy and creates money to pay for the costs of war. In the first four of these inflationary periods, when the war was over, the government budget came back into balance and prices predictably declined, or at least leveled off. Stability returned to the financial markets. The experience of World War II is a good example. During the early years, the Federal government ran huge deficits and the money stock more than doubled as the Federal Reserve monetized a part of the debt with newly printed money. Prices increased by over 60% during World War II in spite of the OPA price controls and rationing. But, by the end of 1946, we were approaching a balanced budget and, in 1947, price increases had ceased. In fact, the period 1947 to 1962 proved to be one of the most prolonged periods of stable prices and stable economic growth in the twentieth century. The only exception was in 1950, when the government had to finance the Korean War. The inflationary result was predictable.Well, then what happened with our last war, the Vietnam conflict? An analysis shows that the source of our present economic dilemma was the same as before, the need to finance a war. The only difference is that those policies have been carried over into the peace time period. This is the first time this has occurred in the entire history of the U.S. Since 1965, the Federal government has run a $100 billion deficit, and 40% has been financed by printing money.",,American Petroleum Institute
839,321372,,Complaint Tower Approach To Deep Water Platforms,Frank Chuck(Exxon Production Research Co.),,,,,,API-76-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"The concept of using a guyed tower for an offshore drilling platform is over 80 years old. A. W. Palmer, a mining engineer, obtained a patent in 1894 on a small tender-assisted guyed tower designed for diamond drilling exploration of coal seams beneath the Firth of Forth in Scotland, see Figure 1. There is no record that Palmer ever put his idea to use.Exxon Production Research Company's first serious interest in the guyed tower dates from 1968, when a preliminary design and a small model was constructed. Further work was then deferred for several years while an extensive examination of buoyant tower structures was completed. The buoyant tower concept is shown in Figure 2. It consists of a pile founded base which anchors the tower, a large mechanical pivot similar to a universal joint, and the tower structure which is ballasted at the lower end and has large buoyancy members near the water line. Two problem areas were identified. One related to the pivot, and the other to the substantial flexure of the well conductors at the base of the tower. These problems were not considered to be insolvable, but they made it attractive to reactivate the study of the guyed tower.A detailed mathematical analysis of the guyed tower was started in 1972. The concept initially developed as shown in Figure 3. Serendipity played a part in the guyline design. Exxon Production Research had previously developed a new type of drag anchor which buried deeply and would not pull out when subjected to heavy loads and substantial up lift forces. The guyline system for the tower incorporated an elongated clump weight to minimize the up lift on the anchor. Experimental results showed that the length and weight of the clump could be designed to provide a stiff1' mode of response for all commonly occurring waves, and a compliant mode for the few giant waves.The response of the guyline system of a 1500-ft tower designed for North Sea environmental conditions is shown in Figure 4. This tower is equipped with twenty guylines of 3-112 diameter, and 300 kip articulated clump weights 100' long. At zero wave height, the tower is offset 4.5 feet by 70 kips of wind load and a 2.25 mph current. The steady state forces rise to 400 kips of wind load and 3.4 mph current under the maximum conditions which produce 100 foot design waves. The curve showing tension in the most heavily loaded windward line is a gradually rising catenary out to about 20 feet of offset which corresponds to 600 kips of tension. The curve then flattens out for larger offsets. The line tension is still below the maximum allowable (50% of breaking strength) in a 100 foot sea, which could cause an offset of 52 feet.",,American Petroleum Institute

Western Div.),,,,,,API-76-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"INTRODUCTIONThis paper is intended to report the progress of the SACROC carbon dioxide injection project which commenced in early 1972. The field history leading to the inception of the project will be reviewed only briefly here. Numerous papers have been published previously to describe in great detail the reservoir (Refs. 1, 3, 10), the carbon dioxide displacement process (Refs. 5, 10), the transmission of carbon dioxide to the field (Refs. 2, 6), the mechanics of the operation of the project (Refs. 4, 7, 0, 12), and other matters (Refs. 9, 11). These subjects will be touched on here only by way of reminding the reader of these more detailed references.HISTORY PRIOR TO CARBON DIOXIDE INJECTIONSACROC Unit, which constitutes the major part of the Kelly-Snyder Field, is located in Scurry County, Texas, as shown on Figure 1. The field's production and injection history is summarized in Figure 2 , and basic reservoir data is set out in Figure 3. The field history has been interesting in its variety: development state, a brief period of primary depletion by solution gas drive, 17 years of pressure maintenance by a unique centerline water injection project, and, finally, the pattern carbon dioxide injection project. Carbon dioxide injection actually was preceded by pre-carbon dioxide pattern water injection for a period ranging from several months to as much as three years. Thus there have been several different dominant drive mechanisms at work throughout the field's history.The carbon dioxide project was undertaken in an effort to reduce the tremendous quantity of oil which would remain unrecovered following the centerline waterflood. The waterflood, though very successful, would still leave approximately a billion barrels of oil behind. Original estimates were that carbon dioxide injection could increase reserves by more than 150 million barrels. The project has evolved considerably since its inception, and yet, in most important respects, the operation has proceeded essentially according to plan. In December 1969 the Texas Railroad Commission approved plans to inject carbon dioxide and agreed to increase the Unit allowable from 174,270 to 243,978 BPD, subject to market demand proration. This was a critical prerequisite to the undertaking because of the large early expenditures required to initiate the project. Canyon Reef Carriers, Inc. (CRC) was formed by the major owners of SACROC Unit in December 1970 for the purpose of delivering carbon dioxide to the Unit from the Val Verde Basin some 200 miles to the south, where carbon dioxide was being vented as an unwanted by-product at several gas fields. Construction of a pipeline and compression system, which has been described in earlier papers (Refs. 2, 6, 7), required most of 1971. Carbon dioxide injection actually commented on January 26, 1972.THE CARBON DIOXIDE PROJECT: THE ORIGINAL PLANThe original plan for the carbon dioxide injection project was to inject approximately 200 MMCF/day of carbon dioxide into 174 injection wells in inverted nine-spot patterns.",,American Petroleum Institute

Dosher(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-76-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"1.A FACT ABOUT PETROLEUM DISCOVERY RATES IN THE U.S.The American Petroleum Institute's Annual Reserves of Crude Oil and Natural Gas in the United States and Canada and United States Productive Capacity has a blue cover. Few in the industry are aware of this, and still few ever have recourse to what's between the blue covers. It's most important annual item, the reserves of oil and gas at the end of the year, is usually summarized for most of us in the slick or yellow pages of the trade press.However, these volumes together with the statistical information developed by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and those of the state regulatory commissions contain the history of our industry. Just about everything you need to know about petroleum production is contained in them. Just as important, is the fact that the historical statistics are perhaps the best guide to the future of our industry. One of the most striking conclusions that one is led to in studying these statistical facts is that the United States is not a single oil province. Actually, the United States is fortunate to contain a number of singularly, unique oil provinces. If one wants to understand the history of discovery, reserves and productive capacity, one must study these different oil provinces as individual phenomena. Neither apple nor anything else rhymes with orange, and similarly the Venango and Bradford sands of New York and Pennsylvania are quite unlike the San Andreas and Wolfcamp carbonates of West Texas.However, the exception proves the rule. There is one instance where it serves our purpose to look at the overall picture, to consider the United States as a single oil producing province. That instance is when we seek to assess our total national needs and compare them to our rate of discovery of new petroleum supplies. In Figure 1 we have done just that. It is immediately apparent that there is a marked discrepancy between the rate of domestic discoveries and the domestic demand for crude oil. Further, this discrepancy has existed for some time and if the trend continues the discrepancy is going to get bigger and bigger. That we have been able to maintain even a modest degree of self sufficiency, supplying some two thirds of our crude oil consumption in recent years, speaks very well for the discoveries and reserve additions the industry made in the past. On purpose, or by accident, we put our discoveries into the reserve bank and saved them for a rainy day.

Honarvar(Utah State University Logan Utah),,,,,,API-76-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"Seven typical drilling fluids were mixed at ratios of 1:l and 1:4 liquid mud to soil with six soils; these mixtures were tested for their effects on plant growth. Beans and corn in pots in the greenhouse grew normally in a few mixtures, but in most instances it is concluded that too much soluble salts or too high an exchangeable sodium percentage was the cause of reduced plant growth. Additions of gypsum without leaching was ineffective. When leaching was accomplished using a high salt water in the first volumes of water passing through ( to keep the soil flocculated while exchangeable sodium was removed), plant growth was improved in most instances. The causes of high salt content were potassium chloride and sodium dichromate, mostly. The dispersing problem of heated soils caused by high exchangeable sodium percentages results from the high sodium hydroxide contents added to all muds. The high sodium problem, the formation of sodic soils, is solvable hut requires some wetting and drying cycles along with chemical amendments and leaching to accomplish.INTRODUCTIONDrilling fluids (also to be referred to as -muds) are essential in drilling operations. The mud cleans the hole of drilling debris, cools the drilling head, seals off porous geologic strata, and performs other beneficial functions. Only limited areas are contaminated by small quantities of the muds left at the drill site when drilling is stopped. Nevertheless, the current concern to maintain a suitably clean environment requires that drilling mud waste be studied for any possible localized effects on soils or plant growth.Drilling fluid composition varies with the needs of the hole, especially its depth. Water is often used in shallow drilling depths, but additional materials, muds, are needed for deep holes. This research is concerned only with muds -- aqueous drilling fluids which contain large amounts of barite (barium sulfate ), small amounts of bentonite (a montmorillonite clay), and various other additives.LITERATURE REVIEWAlmost no studies on the effects of drilling muds on soils or plant growth have been published. Most information on the effects on plants of the more than 600 brand-name additives used in muds has been deduced from studies other than those involving drilling muds.A preliminary study involving thirty-one individual mud components verified that plant growth was reduced by several materials1. Diesel oil, high concentrations of potassium chloride, high additions of sodium hydroxide, some starch, somelignosulfonates, and high levels of sodium dichromate caused the most obvious effects. The phytotoxicity of diesel oil is well known by those involved in weed . control--it is often used alone as an herbicide. The short-chain volatile portions of crude oils, which include diesel oil, are the most toxic2,3The effects of soluble salts, mostly from the potassium chloride and sodium . . dichromate, is to reduce plant growth more as their concentrations increase. The effects of soluble salts on plant growth are quite well documented and predictable4,5. Most plants have severe growth reduction at soil-paste extract conductivities of about 8 to 10 mmhos/cm. Many mixtures of soil with what are considered to be heavy doses of soluble potassium chloride or sodium dichromate have produced conductivities of 12 to over 100 mmhos/cm; these are high values often completely inhibiting plant growth1.",,American Petroleum Institute

Roman-Lazio(University of Tulsa),,,,,,API-76-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"Subsurface safety valves (SSSVs) are required by law in most off shore producing wells and are one of the many devices available for well fluid containment. The purpose of the valves is to shut off well flow in the production tubing below the mudline in the event disasters, such as explosions or fires, disable surface shutdown devices. Several types of SSSVs are used, including those which are controlled from the surface by hydraulic fluids, pressure sensing valves, and differential pressure or fluid velocity actuated valves. This paper deals only with velocity actuated SSSVs.Actuation of the velocity-type SSSV is based on a simple force balance principle. Loss of pressure above a valve increases the flow rate though the valve and also the pressure loss across the valve. For subcritical flaw, the pressure loss across a restriction, such as the choke or bean used in a safety valve, is proportional to the flow rate of fluids . The safety valve is held open by spring and seal gripping farces which together are greater than the opposing resultant well fluid forces generated by normal production rates. however, for higher than normal production rates corresponding to loss of tubing head back-pressure, the net well fluid forces become great enough to overcome the spring and seal gripping forces and to actuate valve closure. The consequences of incorrect valve sizing are either premature closures which result in lost production and operator expense or loss of protection from using a valve which cannot be closed by well flow rates corresponding to disaster conditions.Before recent API safety valve standards were written, functional testing procedures and selection of manufacturing tolerances on critical valve components were left. to the discretion of valve manufacturers. New API standards1and recommended practices2have been written by the API Committee on Standardization of Offshore Safety and Anti- Pollution Equipment (OSAPE). These documents provide manufacturing tolerances and a formal procedure for functional and performance testing.Current recommendations for valve type and spring and choke size for each well condition are made using technology based on single-phase flow theory. Since most valves operate under gas-liquid flaw conditions, the development of improved multiphase flow ,prediction was recognized as a high potential area for safety valve improvement. As a result, the API Offshore Safety and Anti-Pollution Research Committee (OSAPR) awarded a research grant to The University of Tulsa to study multiphase flow through safety valves and chokes.

Texas A and M University Research Foundation was engaged to undertake this study. A previous paper entitled, Sand Erosion in Critical Equipment-A Progress Report on API Research'' was presented at the 1975 API Annual Meeting, Division of Production, in Dallas, Texas. The 1975 paper summarized the work accomplished up to that time includingan industry practice review,description of the equipment and procedures used in conducting sand erosion tests,laboratory results of tests at that time andtests proposed for the remainder of the year.This paper was prepared togive a brief report of the laboratory results of tests conducted during 1975 andto discuss further work planned under a new project for 1976 entitled, Optimizing Design of Equipment to Resist Sand Erosion. INTRODUCTIONErosion of production equipment resulting from sand production with oil and gas is a major operating problem, both in terms of cost of equipment replacement and in terms of pollution and/or fire caused by flow line or related production equipment failure. Equipment failures which occur on offshore platforms generally are much more serious than failure on land. With the current emphasis on obtaining maximum production of oil and gas from all producing wells to meet the Nation's energy, needs, sand erosion of facilities becomes more serious. Tests at Texas A and M University have demonstrated that sand erosion is more severe at the higher fluid velocities associated with higher rates of production. The tests conducted by Texas A and M University have been made by injecting varying amounts of sand into compressed air streams flowing at several velocities. The tests were aimed at determining the following:The effect of geometry of various production fittings on rate of sand erosion.The erosion characteristics of various sand laden air flow velocities.The effect of varying amounts of sand.The effectiveness of various coating materials for protecting fittings against erosion.The resistance to sand erosion of metals with various physical characteristics.The correlation of erosion rate of sand detection devices to the loss of metal from production fittings.The objectives of the API Research Project No. 2 have been met and the program was terminated effective December 31, 1975. A preliminary report dated February, 1976, was prepared by Texas A and M and was presented to the API on February 11, 1976.EQUIPMENT AND TEST PROCEDURE FOR EVALUATING SAND EROSIONThe following is a discussion of the equipment and the procedures employed in conducting sand erosion tests of oil and gas well surface producing equipment.",,American Petroleum Institute
845,321378,,THE runaway expectations,Jenkins Lloyd Jones Sr.(The Tulsa Tribune),,,,,,API-76-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"Last year I was in a fancy Long Beach restaurant listening to a couple of spoiled children at the next table griping about what was really superb food when the phrase, PLUM DUFF , popped into my mind.For a moment I couldn't place it, and then I remembered that it was the sweet dessert served once a week on the New Bedford whaler described by Richard Henry Dana in his classic, Two Years Before the Mast .Perhaps this incident is appropriately told here in Los Angeles, for Dana visited this sleepy little Mexican town exactly 140 years ago when his ship lay for weeks at San Pedro loading hides. Plum Duff was a pretty miserable concoction of flour, sugar and dried New England plums, none of which was improved by the long haul around Cape Horn. Yet it was received with joy each Sunday by the crew because all week long they had been on irridescent salt pork and wormy biscuits.The difference between the grateful whaler crew and the spoiled children at the Long Beach table was simply this: the former expected little and was grateful for a second-rate favor. The latter expected too much and spurned a first-rate blessing.There is a legitimate analogy here in the world of business and production. Totalitarian nations are notoriously bad at producing consumer goods. People don't drive their cars. They have no cars to drive. They jam subways or wait patiently in cold or heat for non-air-conditioned trains, trams, and buses. Commodity choice is narrow, quality generally poor, and, in terms of hours of labor required to earn enough to make a purchase, the goods are grossly overpriced.Yet because the propaganda apparatus incessantly assails their eyes and dins into their ears the message that they live in the best of all possible societies, and that the poor proletariat in the outside world is perpetually exploited, crushed and starved, there is a high degree of acceptance of this state of affairs.The free world, on the other hand, has been fed on rising expectations, some of it comes from office-seeking politicians who are unlimited in their promises. Much of it is, of course, the human desire, shared by us all, that we may live better next year.But a large part of it comes from the business community, itself. The whole thrust of advertising feeds on rising expectations. Buy a better house. Wear a prettier dress. Get cleaner dishes with less work from the new detergent. Have a boat and go water-skiing. Get a camper and go snow-skiing. Gargantua Gas will get you more go to the gallon!Thus it is that while the overworked sailors on Dana's ship, like the blindered and brainwashed children of dictatorship, were grateful for small gifts, the spoiled citizens of the great free industrial states, like the spoiled children in the Long Beach restaurant, are inclined to view any shortfall in delivering their expectations as a breakdown of the system.",,American Petroleum Institute

It is not necessary for me to talk about the nature of those variables when addressing a group such as this. It is necessary for me to qualify our estimates as we go along, and I hope you will bear with me.Now, what is the big news as we see it in the Department of the Interior for energy patterns in the United States during the years left in this century?First, we can say with a great-degree of surety that this nation is moving inexorably closer to the electrified energy economy.Second, we can say that hydrocarbons will provide less and less of our total energy needs -- on a percentage basis -- as the years go by.Third, nuclear energy will take up a much bigger part of the energy load. How much that increase will be depends upon factors which are not amenable to solution by the slide rule and the computer--factors such as the reaction of voters to state legislative proposals which would ban or severely restrict nuclear power plant construction, Fourth, coal will slowly increase its share of the total energy market. Because it is available in great quantities, coal stands ready and able to fill in the gaps if any other energy form falls short of its predicted success. To quantify these predictions, we feel that coal, which now produces 19% of our total energy, will increase its share to 21% by 1985. This is only a small increase in percentage, but it represents an increase of eight quadrillion BTU's. Our total energy consumption is expected to rise from today's 71.1 quadrillion BTU's to 103.5 quadrillion BTU's in 1985 and up to 163.5 quadrillion BTU's in 2000.Petroleum, which now provides 46%, will drop to 44% in 1955 and to 31% in 2000.Natural Gas, will drop from today's 28% to 1985's 19% and to 12% by 2000.Oil Shale, which currently provides no energy to the nation, will rise to 1% of our total energy by 1985 and up to 5.7% by 2000.We expect hydropower and geothermal energy to move up from today's 3.2% to 3.8% in 1985 and to 6.1% in 2000.",,American Petroleum Institute

Chandler Jr.(Chandler and Associates Inc.),,,,,,API-76-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, Los Angeles, California",1976,"The American people have historically resisted government restraints on their activities because such restraints abridge personal freedom. But personal freedom, unrestrained, leads to anarchy. Constructive restraint in the form of good law, well-conceived and well-executed, is as necessary to man's continuing freedom as are moral restraints and those derived from custom.Our contemporary historians, Will and Ariel Durant, put it this way, Since men love freedom, and the freedom of individuals in society requires some regulation of conduct, the first condition, of freedom is its limitation; make it absolute and it dies in chaos. So the prime task of government is to establish order; organized central force is the sole alternative to incalculable and disruptive force in private hands. Business has always resisted government restraints on its activities. The oilman has resisted such restraints more strongly. His objections are both philosophical and practical. The very nature of exploration and production requires freedom of thought and freedom of action. Moreover, effort channeled into regulation is non-productive in the sense that it produces neither goods nor services and, therefore, carries the implication of waste. Philosophically, it follows to the oilman that any kind of regulation or restriction is repugnant.From the practical side, government regulation does make the oilman's job more difficult. It causes irritating delays. It costs money. It limits his choice of customers. It imposes price ceilings on his crude oil, his natural gas and his products; it limits his profits.But good regulation is just as vital for the oil industry as it is for the American people at large. We have only to look back some 40 years to observe the development of the state conservation laws enacted largely to prevent physical waste and to protect correlative or property rights in order to observe regulation that was constructive in both its effect on the industry and its effect on the American consumer.A stable means of exchange is essential to commerce. Laws and regulations governing our monetary system as well as our financial institutions do contribute toward a stable means of exchange.Certainly as oilmen, we must recognize that our industry, and for that matter any industry, cannot today go its own way, independent of public will and independent of government restraint. On the other hand, it is absurd for the government to believe that it can regulate the oil industry, the most complex of all industry, without the constructive input of oil people.Don't conclude at this point that I advocate greater government controls. I do not. I do advocate the oilman's far greater participation in the field of government. As oilmen, we all too often tend to act as if our battle for greater freedom is won or lost at the legislative level and have tended to ignore or at least look lightly at the implementors or regulators of the new laws. As one regulator said to me, You fellows spend your time on the people writing the laws but leave me alone to write the regulations and I'll get what I want anyway. ",,American Petroleum Institute

Greenwood(Texas A and M University),,,,,,API-77-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 3-6 April, Houston, Texas",1977,"The aim of this project was to identify fitting designs which reduced wear caused by sand erosion. The results of this project show that fitting geometry or upstream pipe diameter increase can minimize erosion if reasonable size and weight allowances can be made. Wear resistant materials and coatings (such as polyurethane) showed promise for reducing wear. However, more work is needed before a suitable fitting can be made commercially available.INTRODUCTIONFitting wear caused by sand erosion was investigated at Texas A M University in OSAPR Project No. 2, Detection and Prevention of Sand Erosion of Offshore Production Equipment1'. Under the sponsorship of the American Petroleum Institute, the project was directed by the API Offshore Safety and Anti-pollution Research Committee (OSAPR) chaired by Dr. R. S. Crog, Union Oil Company of California. Project No. 2 showed that additional work was necessary to apply the findings to the design of fittings to achieve an increased resistance to wear caused by sand erosion. Therefore, OSAPR Project No. 6, Optimizing Designs of Fittings, Chokes, and Related Equipment to Resist Sand Erosion , was initiated. The OSAPR Committee chaired by Dr. Crog directed the project through a Task Group headed by Mr. Claude A. Sellars, Shell Development Company.The following objectives were set for Project No. 6:Select and evaluate in the laboratory those physical shapes and materials which may reduce sand erosion in fittings.Determine a correlation between erosion rate of a fitting and flow system parameters.Identify the existence of a threshold velocity above which accelerated fitting wear occurs.Prepare conclusions and recommendations that the industry can use to reduce sand erosion.Whenever possible, results of Project No. 2 were used to direct and augment the test procedures and results of this project.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSThe following conclusions were reached:Results of this testing indicate that fitting designs which reduce velocity can be utilized to reduce fitting wear due to sand erosion. For the fitting lengths tested, the amount of wear reduction is proportional to the length of the upstream enlargement.In these tests, the bullplugged tee had a service life of up to 6 times that of a standard ell. This resulted from a reduction of about 60% In wear rate and increased metal thickness of the worn surface. This supports the current frequent use of this technique in industry.Test results indicated that special internal coatings and surfaces show promise for decreasing wear rates. However, the coatings most nearly approaching the performance effectiveness of reduced velocity (polyurethane, tungsten carbide), presented as yet unresolved difficulties in fabrication and/or use.",,American Petroleum Institute

Caudle(Continental Oil Company),,,,,,API-77-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 3-6 April, Houston, Texas",1977,"INTRODUCTIONAnalyzing for the oil content of produced water has become increasingly important over the last few years. More and stricter regulations are coming into force which limit the amount of oil that can be discharged with produced water. Analyzing for oil in water is difficult and frequently leads to ambiguous results. In fact, the selection of the method of analysis defines what is meant by oil . Because of these factors, there has recently been much activity in the area of analytical methods for oil determination in water. One such activity is being sponsored by the API Committee on Offshore Safety and Anti-pollution Research.The Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Oil Detection/Oil Removal (ODOR) under administration of the API Production Department Committee on Offshore Safety and Anti-pollution Research (OSAPR) was formed in the summer of 1974 under the Chairmanship of Mr. P. L. Gassett of Gulf Research and Development Company. The objective of the Ad Hoc ODOR Subcommittee is to define and implement appropriate research and development programs in areas of oil detection, measurement, and removal from produced water and solids.The research project which is being discussed in this paper is an outgrowth of an earlier review of research needs. Because there was already much activity in the development of analytical methods for oil in produced water, the Subcommittee decided to concentrate on certain problems in the analysis and interpretation of oil in produced water. Commonly used analytical methods involve extraction of the sample with an oleophilic solvent (e. g., carbon tetrachloride, freon, petroleum ether, n-alkanes, etc.) followed by a quantitative finish (e. g., gravimetry, colorimetry, infrared, ultraviolet). These procedures may give misleading results either by (1) misrepresenting the actual quantity of oil hydrocarbons) present in the discharge (for example, a study conducted jointly by the EPA and the Offshore Operators Committee Sheen Technical Subcommittee demonstrated that at high oil values, a gravimetric finish gave different values than an infrared finish) ; or (2) yielding numbers which cannot be used to properly interpret the performance of oil removal equipment. The latter problem results from the fact that oil removal equipment usually removes only the dispersed oil ; whereas the analyses results give measures of both dispersed and dissolved materials.Some of the variables that are thought t o cause the commonly used methods to disagree are:dissolved organic compounds,suspended solids, andproduction treating chemicals.For example, a method using a gravimetric finish is sometimes suspected of giving erroneously high results because suspended solids were extracted and measured as oil. Therefore, the ODOR Subcommittee has sponsored a research project (OSAPR Project No. 3) whose general aim was to show how various methods are affected by dissolved organics, treating chemicals, and solids. In October, 1975, as a result of competitive bids, a contract was awarded to the Institute for Research of Houston, Texas, to carry on the research. This paper summarizes the results reported by the Institute for Research (Reference 1).",,American Petroleum Institute

Their report, entitledEnhanced Oil Recovery**, was published by the NPC in December 1976, and this paper is based upon that report. The paper describes the basis for the analysis, the analysis methods, the economic assumptions considered, the potential incremental ultimate recovery, and producing rate. The very large uncertainties in the analysis are described and the uncertainty in results is shown graphically, Comments are included on the effect of Government policies on the potential for enhanced oil recovery.INTRODUCTIONThe material for this presentation is based upon a report,Enhanced Oil Recovery, prepared by the National Petroleum Council in December 1976.The National Petroleum Council was asked by the Department of the Interior to assess the state of the art of enhanced recovery for oil and gas from known oil and gas reserves ...(appraise) the probable ranges of volumetric outcomes based on alternative economic conditions ...(recommend) how public policy can improve the out look.The Council agreed to undertake the study and, with approval of the Department of the Interior, established a Committee on Enhanced Recovery Techniques for Oil and Gas in the United States. A Coordinating Subcommittee and two Task Groups assisted the Committee In preparing the report. In selecting the membership of the Committee and the working groups, an attempt was made to appoint individuals who represented the various divergent views on enhanced recovery. The estimates from the study thus represent a consensus from a spectrum of views ranging from optimistic to pessimistic.The Council agreed to examine known enhanced recovery methods and the recovery potential from known oil fields in the United States from the present to the year 2000. This report does not consider the impact on future supply of oil fields discovered after December 31, 1975, nor does it consider the possible application of EOR processes to those fields.The Council did not estimate potential enhanced recovery from producing gas fields, since the opportunity for improving total gas recovery through non-conventional or enhanced recovery processes in these fields is limited. The major potential for non-conventional gas recovery is from low-permeability, presently economic reservoirs. The magnitude of this potential is unknown, but may represent a substantial contribution to the nation's future energy supply. However, very little information is available specifying reservoir volume, location, reservoir geologic characteristics, or other data required to analyze potential recovery and producing rates. Therefore, estimates of possible enhanced gas recovery were not made.The NPC study presents estimates of what could happen under certain technical and economic circumstances and is not intended to represent a forecast of what will occur. Other recent studies on enhanced recovery were used as references when appropriate and their results are compared with the results of this study. The possible environmental impacts of enhanced oil recovery operations are considered in the report.",,American Petroleum Institute

I want to thank Mr. Leigh for inviting me to speak at your Annual Meeting today. I should thank as well Malcolm Otts, who serves as Chairman of the Production General Committee when he is not overseeing our own Production Department at Gulf Energy and Minerals.Mr. Leigh has suggested that my topic be an overview, from Gulf's standpoint, of our nation's oil and gas policies. Since we are on the eve of finding out what the Administration will recommend, this will probably be one of the last speeches you will hear in which we will have a chance to project from our own perspective. Henceforth, debate will center around President Carter's approach. We will be analyzing and critiquing -- favorably I hope -- what the new Administration wants to do.I do not envy President Carter or Mr. Schlesinger their jobs. They have an incredibly complex and difficult task to sort out the options before them and elicit public support for what must be -- and what they apparently realizewillbe -- politically unpopular decisions.As we are all well aware, there is a broad distinction between politics and statesmanship. We have seen too many examples of the former -- and too little evidence of the latter in energy matters. I am encouraged by the President's recent comments to the effect that he is willing to trade-off some of his own political popularity in the interests of an effective national energy policy. He has indicated that sacrifices will be asked of all sectors. It is obvious at this point that sacrifices and compromises are inescapable. There is no need for me to review the facts and figures of our predicament. You are as familiar with the numbers as I am.As for the implications of failing to deal with the problem, some have likened the threat we face to that of war -- although less evident and more subtle than war. It has been said that over the next decade and beyond the importing nations could be strangled for want of energy.Dr. John J. McKetta is one of the country's most knowledgeable authorities on energy and the environment. He is also a professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas. Dresser Industries ran an ad last month featuring an interview with Dr. McKetta. I noticed it in theWall Street Journal-- some of you may also have noticed it. In the ad, Dr. McKetta warned that even if we act immediately to formulate an effective energy policy, we will still experience a deterioration in our standard of living by 1985.But if we allow the problems to drag on, he predicts: Quote -- ...the Government, by 1985, will have on its payrolls a large number of 'regulators' who will appear at our homes to make certain that we maintain low temperatures in the winter and high temperatures in the summer, and that our clothes dryers are permanently disconnected. Air conditioners in automobiles will be banned and we will drive on Saturday and Sunday for emergency purposes only. End quote.",,American Petroleum Institute

My confidence was based on several factors. The Ninety-Fourth Congress had dealt with the natural gas problem at great length with the Senate passing the Bentsen-Pearson bipartisan compromise bill on October 22, 1975, by a surprisingly comfortable 58-32 margin. When a similar measure failed in the House of Representatives by a two vote margin on February 5, 1976, it seemed only a matter of time before a few more votes could be changed. This mood was further reinforced by President (then candidate) Carter's pronouncements in favor of deregulation on his last campaign swing through the producing states.Needless to say, my crystal ball was more than slightly clouded. I am still optimistic that some form of deregulation of wellhead prices will be adopted by the Congress this year. That result however, will require a tremendous effort on the part of all of us who believe that the free market pricing mechanism is the essential ingredient to doing anything to solve the supply problem, the demand problem, the conservation problem, the resource allocation problem and the capital formation problem.What has happened in the past four months that has translated deregulation once again into a political enigma? Perhaps the most important factor has been the weather. All of us have been hoping for some time that a return to a normally cold winter from the mild seasons of the past three years might give the Congress and the consuming public a clearer message about the reality of the natural gas shortage. But this past winter, with record cold temperatures, with thousands of plants and schools closed and with millions of workers layer off from their jobs, was simply too severe, too tragic in its consequences to give a clear political message. People were cold, they were economically hurt and they became angry. In such times there is always a very normal tendency to want the Government to do more, not less, to solve the problem.Secondly, there has arisen a fresh wave of charges of withholding against producers. Although these charges are, for the most part, old and obviously groundless, they have been revitalized by the new Administration's zeal to do things better and cleaner and more responsibly. Certainly, all of us hope that they will do just that and put these charges finally to bed. And, although this isn't a speech about the various charges of producer misconduct, let me interject one thought: every responsible member of the oil and gas industry should make it his and her business to know what those charges are and what the answers to them are. The answers are on the record; the Oil and Gas Journal has recently recompiled them and we have reprints available. But I can assure you that unless each one of us can speak knowledgeably and factually on these issues to our friends, our neighbors, and our associates in the business community, we will lose the credibility battle.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-78-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"The offshore arctic areas represent the oil industry's newest frontier and greatest technical challenge. Problems of ice, low temperature, and remoteness create unique operating conditions. Industry has developed new technology to meet the challenge of operating in the area of the proposed 1979 Beaufort Sea lease sale. The time frame from lease-award to commercial production will, however, be on the order of seven to ten years.INTRODUCTIONThe first major extension of domestic offshore arctic exploratory drilling operations is expected to follow the state and Federal offshore sale for the Beaufort Sea, presently scheduled for late 1979. The successful bidders may have ten years to establish comercia1 production in order to continue the state leases. However, legislation now before the Alaskan Senate would reduce the ten-year period to five years, and under existing regulations, all Federal leases will be for five years. In our opinion the oil industry and government have sufficient information to proceed with the lease sale and exploratory drilling based on experience gained by the industry in Canadian waters offshore the Mackenzie Delta and in the arctic islands. This experience is supplemented by numerous studies on conditions in the proposed lease area. Our principal concern is that in some sections of the least sale area a five-year lease term will be inadequate for proper exploratory drilling evaluation. Ten years from lease award will probably be required to install production facilities and establish commercial production in some areas.Offshore from the Alaska North Slope the continental shelf varies in width from about 30 miles at the Canadian border to about 50 miles at Point Barrow. Much of this shelf area has a water depth of less than 120 ft. The seafloor is a gently-sloping plane that has been scoured from pressure ridge and ice island impacts. Shallow lagoons, formed by barrier islands located 1 to 12 miles off the coast, occur at some sections of the coast. Sea ice occurs along the coast at least 9 months of the year. First year sea ice has a maximum thickness of about 7 ft. in this area. Near the coastline the ice has little movement between freezeup and breakup. Ice movement increases with distance from the coast as does the number of pressure ridges, multiyear ice floes, and ice island fragments. Farther out to sea the 13 ft. thick (average) polar pack is in continual motion. Wave height in the area is limited by the amount of open water and the depth of the water. Storm tides of up to 10 ft. have been recorded.The focus of this paper will be on arctic offshore technology related to the development of exploratory drilling and production facilityconceptsfor operations in the arctic offshore environment. The description of basic conditions that may be encountered in the lease areas (particularly sea ice,concept/conditioninteraction (e.g., ice forces and run up), andenvironment protectionare the key considerations in facilities studies.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-78-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"The impact of environmental regulations upon American industry has changed dramatically in the past 12 months. President Carter signed the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on August 7, 1977. These amendments are extra ordinarily complex and will affect industry with a severity unprecedented in recent history. Then on December 28, 1977, he signed the Clean Water Act of 1977. While this law also will affect industry, its impact is predicted to be far less severe than the Clean Air Act Amendments.Both of these new laws hold great promise for improving the environment. They similarly hold great potential for disrupting the Nation's economy -- primarily through delays they can impose on new projects throughout the country.We in the oil industry who could be accused of being prejudiced in such matters are not the only ones raising warnings about the potential impact of these new laws.John Quarles, former Deputy Administrator of EPA, said in a December 28 article in the Wall Street Journal that the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments . . . like a loose cannon on a pitching deck threaten(s) a path of destruction. I commend his entire article to your reading.I wish I could describe the interweavings of these laws and the multitude of ways they can touch all of our lives. That simply cannot be done in a full day and certainly hardly touched upon in this short talk . I would like to try to focus on two areas of most severe impact contained in the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments to illustrate what can happen.I have studied at least a dozen analyses of these Amendments by a variety of lawyers, engineers, agency personnel, and environmentalists. One striking revelation of this study is that few of the analysts agree upon what was intended or what is required by this Act. It also leads to the obvious question which most of the analysts also raised: What did Congress have in mind when it adopted this law? Most thoughtful Washington observers conclude that:Congress believed that it had a clear mandate from the people to clean up the environment. I think Congress was right -- the public does want the environment cleaned up -- and this is a force which all of us must recognize very clearly.Congress had little idea what it actually was supporting in the 1977 Amendments, other than to reflect this clear mandate from the people to clean up the environment. Some of the finest environmental analysts in the country have spent literally months analyzing the 1977 Amendments, and still cannot agree on details. I think it is clear that Congress was like all the rest of us-- they simply did not fully comprehend the detailed workings of the Act, or recognize its severe adverse economic impacts.But regardless of any confusion or uncertainty, the simple fact is that we do have a new law, and regulations already have started to flow from that law. The question now is : How is this new law going to affect our industry's ability to produce energy? The parts of the Act which I will focus on are known as theNon-attainment and Prevention of Significant Deteriorationprovisions, or PSD for short. These sections will affect industry in two basic ways:New facilities, or modifications to existing facilities, will become much more difficult to build. Permitting requirements, delays, and costs will increase far beyond those now being experienced.Most facilities now in operation will be required to retrofit additional controls on air emissions. The costs appear to be major.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sellers(Cities Service Company),,,,,,API-78-E001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"Thank you for your introduction, Mr. Goralski, and good morning to all of you. I have looked forward to participating in a panel discussion that includes such a diversity of interests. As we all recognize, no definitive energy solutions will ever be possible without a reconciliation of the points of view represented here today. People from environmental groups, the Federal government and large civic organizations must all be involved in developing the consensus that will be required to resolve the public policy issues which are the nation's energy dilemma.This panel was asked to answer the question, Our Energy Problem: Is There a Workable Solution? Before addressing that subject directly, perhaps it would be well to define just what the problem is . It has three elements--social, economic and environmental--but in my perception it starts with the social problems of this nation. Let me mention one aspect of those in particular.A substantial portion of this country's population now has a standard of living which all of us would regard as unacceptably low. The degree of this problem is difficult to quantify. Many efforts have been made, and they have resulted in differing numbers. But, at the minimum, 20 percent of our population has a standard of living too low to be condoned in our modern society. On a worldwide basis the percentage is much higher. If this segment of the population is to achieve the standard of living which we view as reasonable, our country's absolute consumption of energy will need to increase in the decades ahead.The second factor in our energy problem relates to economics. -Energy costs are up, although in the United States they still are significantly below replacement costs in most cases. The fact that energy costs are up will influence both the supply and demand of energy in the future. We already have seen substantial steps towards conservation of energy--reflecting the new economics of energy usage. This will continue. Energy costs, however, are not equal to replacement costs, and so a full-scale effort to develop indigenous energy sources has not yet been mounted in this country.The third aspect of the energy problem which is important for our discussion today is environmental. Almost by definition, any development which will allow potential energy to be converted into something usable by mankind will have an impact on the environment. These effects are not easily quantified in conventional economic terms. This poses a major question: Can workable approaches be developed to address our energy problem in a manner that will be acceptable not only to people with different interests but perhaps even those with different subjective evaluations?I believe that such approaches can be developed, and I believe that dialogues such as the one we are having here today represent one element in reaching a consensus. This consensus will not be perfect in the eyes of any individual, but hopefully it will address the imperatives of each position.",,American Petroleum Institute
857,321390,,Design Criteria For Selecting Velocity Type Subsurface Safety Valves,H.D. Beggs|J.P. Brill|E.P. Kanu|C.A. Paz-y-Mino,,,,,,API-78-G001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"INTRODUCTIONSubsurface safety valves (SSSVs) are required by law in most offshore producing wells. The purpose of the valves is to shut off well flow in the production tubing below the mudline in the event disasters, such as explosions or fires, disable surface shutdown devices. Several types of SSSVs are used, including those which are controlled from the surface by hydraulic fluids, pressure sensing valves, and differential pressure or fluid velocity actuated valves. This report deals only with velocity actuated SSSVs.Actuation of the velocity-type SSSV is based on a simple force balance principle. Loss of pressure above a valve increases the flow rate through the valve and also the pressure drop across the valve. For subcritical flow, the pressure loss across a restriction, such as the choke or bean used in a safety valve, is proportional to the flow rate of fluids through the restriction. The safety valve is held open by spring and seal gripping forces which together are greater than the opposing resultant well fluid forces generated by normal production rates. However, for higher than normal production rates corresponding to loss of tubinghead backpressure, the net well fluid forces become great enough to overcome the spring and seal gripping forces and to actuate valve closure. The consequences of incorrect valve sizing are either premature closures, which result in lost production and operator expense, or loss of protection from using a valve which cannot be closed by 'well flow rates corresponding to disaster conditions.Before recent API safety valve standards were written, functional testing procedures and selection of manufacturing tolerances on critical valve components were left to the discretion of valve manufacturers. New API standards and recommended practices have been written by the API Committee on Standardization of Offshore Safety and Anti-Pollution Equipment (OSAPE). These documents provide manufacturing tolerances and a formal procedure for functional and performance testing.The design procedure to be followed when selecting a velocity-type SSSV for a particular well is illustrated in Fig. 1, which is a logic diagram of the computer program described in API RP-14B. Steps 1-3 are based on measured well flow data and are required to predict the productivity or inflow performance of the well. Steps 4-6 are used to determine the bean size required to produce the desired pressure drop across the valve for the selected closure flow rate. Once the bean size and pressure drop are determined, it is then necessary to select the valve components which will allow the SSSV to close at the pressure drop calculated in Step 6. This is illustrated in Step 7 and involves selecting the spring force which balances the pressure force tending to close the SSSV at the selected flow rate.Prior to completion of this study, recommendations for valve type and spring and choke size for each well condition were made using technology based on single-phase flow theory. Since most valves operate under gas-liquid flow conditions, the development of improved multi-phase flow predictions was recognized as a high potential area for safety valve improvements.",,American Petroleum Institute

Inc.),,,,,,API-78-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"Thank you for that generous introduction, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here -- among friends -- and a privilege to appear before such a distinguished audience.It's been quite a day. We've heard some very thoughtful -- and thought provoking -- words here this afternoon; and I know we're all looking forward to sitting down and discussing them over a little refreshment later. So, with that in mind, I'll try to keep my remarks reasonably short.I have been asked to talk to you today about Our Industry -- Its Capabilities and Its Constraints. But before I get in to my assigned topic, I'd like to say a few words about another subject that also begins with the letter c -- and that is credibility. It's a problem our industry is having to contend with more and more each day.I know you've often stopped and wondered -- just as I have -- how in the world did a bunch of Good Guys like us ever become so unpopular -- or so misunderstood. It's hard to imagine that some people just don't believe we have their best interests at heart. They don't seem to trust what we have to say. I hate o admit this, but possibly some of the mistrust is of our own doing. While some of us were predicting an energy crunch some l0'and even 20 years ago, we ended up selling our oil -- and especially our price-controlled natural gas -- at ridiculously low prices. And not only that -- because of the competitive nature of our business -- we also gave away dishes, balloons and hula-hoops, to boot!No wonder some people have trouble believing that the country really faces a serious energy problem -- but it does. It's a matter of simple arithmetic.Right now, the United States relies on oil and natural gas for three-fourths of its energy. But our nation's economy requires more petroleum than America is producing from its own domestic fields. And we're using up our oil and gas reserves faster than we are finding replacement for them.This, in turn, is causing a rapid increase in our dependence on foreign oil. Last year, for instance, the U. S. imported almost half of its crude oil and refined products -- at a cost of more than $45 billion. Even with Alaska's North Slope oil now moving to market, our imports are not likely to decline this year -- and neither is the cost.Some time in the future -- as we all know -- alternate energy resources will be developed; but this will take a long time and cost a lot of money. Alternate resources are not likely to provide more than a token contribution to our country's energy supply for 20 to 25 years -- at the very least.To bridge this gap, we are going to need more oil and natural gas. Even with vigorous conservation and increased coal and nuclear power development, our nation most likely will be relying on oil and gas for about 60 percent of its energy in 1985.",,American Petroleum Institute

After a period of these long lines, the price went up about 20%, and gasoline became plentiful again. It didn't take an economist to figure out there had been a rip-off.And whether you hold the position that the government bungled the job of negotiating with the Arab sand thereby lost control of the international oil market - as many of us hold - or whether you hold that the majors simply made a fast buck . . . . The fact is the people felt there had been a rip-off.And it became a political job to see who could lay the blame on whom. I think we would all have to say that the government won that particular lobbying event -- it did a pretty good job of laying the blame on the major oil companies.Since that time we have been loaded down with a fantastic amount of energy legislation , nearly every bit of it punitive with respect to oil and gas exploration and development. Not one piece of legislation has been passed which has encouraged the exploration and development of crude oil or natural gas.It seems to us that if there had been an organized effort todeterthe development of domestic oil and gas, it could not have been more effective than the policies that we have in this country today.Let's presume what you could do if you really wanted to create a shortage of oil and gas ---- First, you would freeze the price and keep it low; this would assure wasteful use and a massive shift from other fuels and it would eventually cut off future supplies. Second, you would put up some roadblocks in the form of administrative requirements. Third, you would reduce the hunting grounds by making certain areas off limits - particularly, those with a high potential for undiscovered oil and gas . . . . The government has done all three.We are all familiar with the current gas market. The country is paying a terrible price for interstate gas controls going back to 1954. The current so called natural gas deregulation bills seem mostly aimed at including the intrastate gas market within the sphere of regulation.And, of course, the definition of new gas varies with the weather. And the weather is the political climate of the day.You heard Representative Clarence Brown of Ohio give the figures for alternate costs of energy yesterday afternoon. Suffice it to say, the cheapest imported gas is $2.16 per MCF for Canadian gas imported into Montana. The Canadians have scheduled this figure to increase to $3.86 per MCF by 1985.The price of crude oil has been controlled since 1974. The composite price of domestic crude oil in this country was $8.57 a barrel in November 1977. Imported oil costs $14.60 per barrel.",,American Petroleum Institute

Fisher(The University of Texas),,,,,,API-78-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 2-5 April, Denver, Colorado",1978,"Of the several issues before this Nation, few are more critical, more urgent than energy. It has been a prime issue of the present Administration as indeed it was with the previous Administration.It was debated extensively in the previous Congress as it is now and has been during the several months of the current Congress. The obvious difficulty in resolving certain policy aspects of the energy issue speaks to the fact, among other things, that it is a pervasive complex issue, embracing widely divergent views. For the better part of two generations this Nation has enjoyed an extraordinary level of overall economic prosperity, supported to a significant degree by readily available, relatively cheap, versatile energy -- from both domestic and foreign sources. Such energy by any reasonable reckoning is no longer available. Foreign energy, obviously, is no longer inexpensive, and serious questions have been raised relative to future world supply and demand. Our remaining domestic resources of energy, while yet large and substantial are a different and more costly mix compared to our earlier legacy of relatively inexpensive oil and gas.Energy issues have been before us in the technical medium for years. They have been widely presented in the public arena for a half decade. Yet the inevitable transition in energy is marked by reluctance, doubt, and confusion in the minds of many.Yet I need not tell this group that the problem is real, and urgent. It is in its most simple form, an imbalance, and a growing one, between the supply wanted in terms of price, source, and kind, and the demand needed and insisted upon. Although the views as to how this supply and demand equation is to be balanced differ substantially, the arithmetic of the equation has been essentially constant. Simply compare the stated energy goals of President Ford's Omnibus Energy Bill of 1975 and President Carter's NEP of 1977.The statistics are essentially the same.Both called for arresting and slightly reducing import levels;Both called for a reduction in the energy growth rate to about 2. percent per year;Both called for a doubling of current coal production by 1985;Both called for stabilizing recent sharp declines in oil and gas production;Both called for substantial increases in domestic nuclear capacity; andBoth called for rigorous Research and Development efforts in alternative energy sources.While the mechanism proposed to reach these goals differs measurably, the goals are essentially identical simply because they are inescapable; in reality, the degrees of freedom in addressing domestic energy problems are not great and options are largely fixed.It is imperative that the magnitude of these goals not be underestimated. If the rising level of imports, with consequent concerns of trade deficits, supply security, and even availability in the mid-term, is to be checked, it can only be done through modification in the historical level of consumption and through increased domestic production.Significantly modifying a long and established history of intensive energy consumption will be difficult in the short term. There are some indications that future growth in energy consumption will be less than that of the past generation. Nonetheless, a near term of reducing growth to an annual rate of 2 percent, which appears modest on the face of it, will require a serious effort in conservation, and must be",,American Petroleum Institute

It recognized a number of realities with regard to the trend and direction of the Nation's energy situation and proposed a series of strategies -- copying mechanisms and hard choices -- aimed at navigating the difficult shoals ahead.Underlying the preparation of the strategies were several fundamental premises. The first of these is that, even though this country stands at the edge of an awesome discontinuity in it s production and use of energy, there is still time to make the adjustments. Second, the question is not whether we will make the transition to a post-petroleum era. The transition will be made. The only question is whether it will be a smooth one, the result of planning and preparation, or chaotic, the result of a succession of worsening economic and political crises. Third, while there is little political mileage to be earned by facing the harsh facts of the transition and planning remedies, the depth and significance of the problems do not allow us to avoid this responsibility. Ours has been a chain letter energy economy in which we have picked up early, handsome dividends at the risk decades from now of our children and grandchildren finding their mailboxes empty.Before solutions can be found, it is necessary to forge a consensus about the problem. Despite a lag in public acknowledgement of the significance of our energy difficulties real progress has been made on this horizon. There now appears rather broad agreement on the definition of the problem.Our Nation is energy vulnerable. Nearly every year another energy delivery has suffered severe breakdowns -- oil, gas, coal; our way of life, our economy, our jobs will be threatened if we don't take advantage of the time available now to make the transition and to solve the basic institutional and supply problems which lie at the root of these breakdowns. This period, a matter of five to ten years, can be seen as years of grace .Energy conservation can buy us precious time to develop new conventional and nonconventional sources that will forest all and prevent energy famine for the Nation later.The age of cheap energy is gone - or at least passing quickly. Greater acceptance of this fact of life in both the public and private sector is fundamental to our ability to make the necessary transition in our energy-based economyIncreasingly, since World War II, we have become dependent upon oil and natural gas, We must face that over the cost of the next5 decade we in the United States will not able to increase the supplies of oil and natural gas Substantially, that those increased supplies will be far less than the demands that will flow from the growth of our economy, And the national energy plan is premised on the continued expansion of the American economy.",,American Petroleum Institute

Both ideas are good ones, but yours is further eroding your credibility by promising something you cannot deliver.This is especially true at a time when there is a very temporary glut of on the market. Those of you who saw ABC News last evening heard Howard K. Smith suggest that the glut presented an opportunity to break OPEC's solid front and get pricesbackwheretheybelong.

Striegler(ARCO Oil and Gas Company Division of Atlantic Richfield),,,,,,API-79-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"IntroductionDuring the last several years some very good drilling performance and cost savings have been achieved by the application of diamond bits in appropriate situations. A substantial feeling persists in the drilling industry that diamond bits area specialized tool to be used in rather unique problem situations. These situations. might involve extremely low drilling rates, a need for-very long bit life, a need to drill a smaller than normal hole size, a need for a high speed down-hole motor bit, or some other special situation.It is much more realistic to consider diamond bits aconventionaltool to be used in any appropriate circumstance where there is a reasonable opportunity to reduce drilling costs without causing additional risk. Generally, application of diamond bits for conventional rotary drilling is worthy of evaluation as an alternative to tricone bits when tricone bit rates are no higher than about 10 to 12 feet per hour. Of course, application to the special situations mentioned above should be continued where appropriate.Presented herein are' some economics of diamond bit applications in various rotary drilling situations. Primary emphasis will be on (1) determining when it is appropriate to consider trying diamond bits and (2) realistically estimating performance that may be attained. Technical design details will not be covered here; rather, an understanding of when operators should contact. diamond bit service companies for study of a particular drilling situation will be developed. Appropriately designed bits and operating guidelines are readily available from bit companies.Economics and Other ConsiderationsThis section concentrates on economic results, and therefore the basis for these calculations must be clearly established. The drilling cost in dollars per foot is the primary tangible measure of drilling efficiency, and it is calculated from the standard equation shown on Figure 1. Intangible savings are also often achieved while using diamond bits. These are not estimated but include advantages that accrue generally to long bit life and faster penetration rate . Diamond bits, being of solid body construction, also are less likely to leave junk in the hole than tricone bits . At the same time, encountering junk with a diamond bit usually leads to a poorer bit run than it would with a tricone bit.Figure 1 is a case which illustrates that increasing drilling rate is much more effective in reducing drilling cost than increasing bit life, once a minimally acceptable bit life of 50 to 100 hours is achieved. For example, if you double the life of a diamond bit drilling 5' ft/hr from 100 hours to 200 hours, the cost is reduced by 11 percent. Doubling the penetration rate would reduce the cost by 50 percent. Doubling the rate and halving the life reduces the cost by 39 percent. This means that diamond bits must be designed for maximum rate with acceptable life rather than maximum life with adequate rate",,American Petroleum Institute

Noble(Sunmark Exploration Company),,,,,,API-79-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"Following the discovery of oil and gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, the Oil Industry turned to other offshore areas including the Baltimore Canyon in an effort to establish additional commercial reserves. Many years have elapsed and almost continuous effort and extremely large capital expenditures have been made in this effort. Only recently has drilling been permitted in Atlantic waters, with initial wells designed to obtain stratigraphic information. Exploration drilling, started in 1978 after many legal problems were overcome, has produced one gas discovery of unknown commercial potential. Equipment has performed well and no major drilling problems have been found. The recent Sale #49 received much lower bids than did Sale #40 and expressed current Industry concerns regarding profitability of the area.INTRODUCTIONAfter nearly two years of delay following the Federal OCS Lease Sale in 1976, Industry has been permitted to begin. exploratory drilling in the Baltimore Canyon area. Initially, results from this drilling seemed quite encouraging with Texaco announcing a potentially significant discovery and several other operators conducting extensive testing programs. However, since the initial encouragement, news has been entirely negative, with only a slight bit of hope cast by the announcement covering the recent Baltimore Canyon #3 C.O.S.T. well.A careful examination of the entire sequence of activities, climaxed by the February 28, 1979 Baltimore Canyon Sale #49 , is in order.AREAThe Baltimore Canyon trough centers some 75 miles east of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Initial reconnaissance seismic exploration began as early as 1960, and by 1969 data acquisition had started in earnest. By 1970 the concept of group shoot seismic data acquisition was well accepted and annual data gathering programs continued until recently.Geophysical data gathering actually occurred along the entire 'U.S. Atlantic Coast, extending out beyond the Continental Shelf. This work quickly pointed to the Baltimore Canyon area as being most prospective and efforts were concentrated in evaluating this basin.Prior to Federal OCS Sale #40 very extensive seismic work had been completed. Also, various other surveys including aeromagnetic, gravimetric and sea floor sampling for geochemical analysis were accomplished. Additionally, information was obtained from the B-2 C. 0. S .T. Well (Continental Off shore stratigraphic Test) drilled to a depth of 16,043' at a cost of $8,.4 million. Probably in the history of exploration never had so much effort been expended prior to a sale and the general structural picture as well understood. With the sale announcement, the U.S.G.S. indicated that their estimate of hydrocarbons for the sale area ranged from 400 million to 1.4 billion barrels of oil and 2.6 to 9.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. More recently (June 19781, U.S.G.S. estimates were revised to 800 million barrels of oil and 13.3 TCF of gas. Without commenting on their quantitative conclusions, it is apparent that this is, in their opinion, a gas prone province.",,American Petroleum Institute

Frank(Sun Production Company Division of Sun Company),,,,,,API-79-E001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"IntroductionIn 1974, Sun Oil Company, now Sun Company, Inc., instituted a study to obtain the average profile and attrition habits of many-of its families that work in the production of oil and gas. That total background analysis depicted high employment for seven years immediately after World War II with an anticipated heavy exodus in the latter 1970's and early 1980's. In fact an update study in 1976 predicted a personnel loss of 42% from the production company during the next 10 years of which two years have already. been consumed. The latter study also showed that the average person leaving Sun Production was 61 if the individual was over 50 years old. This was due to illness, death, or preplanned early retirement. The predicted 42% loss was typical throughout the non-exempt, exempt and managerial ranks.Slide 1reflects the total number of completed oil wells and current number of producing oil wells in the United States. With the extension of their producing life caused by new economics, we can see the wells outlast the work span of most individuals. We suspect our analysis is not uncommon to many major companies. The strategy developed from these detailed analyses required a long term commitment to acquire, train, and develop competent personnel at all levels and such was implemented in 1975 by hourly recruiting. Our professional recruiting has always been strong and aggressive since most major companies lost 5-7% of their professionals per year prior to 1975-78. So my talk today will not dwell on this problem or drilling personnel that has been abnormal.The major thrust of this paper will be the predicted high loss through attrition of field experience within the next 8 years based on a 1976 study. We have had in the past the luxury of developing field hourly personnel in 10 to 20 years and their advancement reflects this pace. However, today we have lease operators and repairmen that have less than 2 t o 3 years total experience where we have been accustomed to decades.Now our offices are farther from field operations and yet one-third to one-half of our technical or professional staff have nearly the same experience profile. Equipment and complicated field operations are two to three times more complex than in 1950's. A 500 barrel tank of oil could represent $7500 and a barrel of - fluid could cost 30t or more lifted and processed. In 1978 Sun was lifting 6.8 barrels of water to obtain a barrel of oil where in the 1960's it was 2 BWIBO. Our wells and equipment are also getting much older and we are lifting more fluid from them.In 1977 we vowed to develop off-job training programs which would, as a minimum, yield 2-1/2 days per year for all hourly personnel with specific jobs exceeding this target. This plan represents 1% of their work days invested in off-job training due to the experience gap that was developing.",,American Petroleum Institute

Anyone who manufactures, fabricates, marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or tests a package or container for use in the transportation of hazardous materials is responsible under this Act.The Act further defines the area of penalties which can be incurred, both civil and criminal. Due to the candor of the Act (the Act requires training), ARCO felt it must actively follow the law in order to protect the company and its employees together with the implicit protection of the stockholders return on investment.There was no company-wide notification of the need for a training program on hazardous materials. However, early in 1978, the Training Development Group began to get requests for assistance in setting up some short training programs in regard to:Filling of tank cars and tank trucksPackaging and labeling of hazardous materialsPlacarding vehicles that transport hazardous materialsSafe practices in regard to the foregoing areas of interestSuch requests came in fortuitously, on a low key basis, and did not have a great impact upon us since we had no great knowledge of the subject. In essence, we saw that it would be cost-effective and operation-effective to consolidate into a team effort. Therefore, Training and Development acted as the central point of contact and became the project leader and coordinator.The first step was to call a meeting of the interested parties with the prime purpose to get an organized training program put together. The meeting resulted in clearly delineating five functional areas that needed to be dealt with. They are:Identification of the problems associated with hazardous materials.Company liability positionDescription of Federal Regulations CFR 49 TransportationCriminal and civil penalties and finesPackaging of hazardous materials.Packing of substancesTank car and tank truck loading and loading racksDocumentation.Proper entries on forms.Proper formsPlacarding and labeling.Manual on Handling of Hazardous Materials.Available to each operator and operator's supervisor who handles",,American Petroleum Institute

After all, there is ample evidence that petroleum companies, large and small, can strongly disagree with one another. However, it may be that the SEC now has provided an unusual opportunity for our agreement. In short, I sense that most oil and gas companies will conclude that RRA is an idea whose time hasnotcome and whose time should never arrive.In thinking about RRA, I find it helpful to consider its place in the longer sweep of history. RRA reflects the sometimes slow and sometimes painful recognition by government, and by the public, that oil and gas are essential for the continued economic vitality of our country.The so-called energy crisis following the 1973 oil embargo triggered a frenzy of thought and action in the public sector. Unfortunately, our government has not addressed the important energy issues with the skill and speed necessary for the moral equivalent of war .. However, it seems that a war-like spirit has been adopted by those in government who always begin solving problems by asking for more information. The avalanche of requests directed to our industry for more and more information is, in a word, enormous. The proposed RRA reporting merely adds pieces to an almost impossible jigsaw puzzle.RRA represents an unusual attempt to provide for uniformity in petroleum accounting. Earlier efforts to obtain uniformity have floundered, but the subject was brought to the surface once again as a result of the .Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. That Act directs the SEC to assure that accounting practices are developed for reports required by the DOE to create an energy data base.My understanding is that the Act doesnotrequire that one uniform accounting method be established and doesnotrequire that the reporting basis for the DOE energy data base be the same as for audited financial statements. I believe it was an SEC decision that one uniform accounting method should be established and used for both purposes. The ill-fated efforts by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to establish such a uniform accounting method by issuing statement No. 19 is now history that I will skip over.Concurrent with the attempts to change petroleum accounting, there have been ongoing efforts to somehow recognize the very real effects of inflation on companies? operations. Both the, FASB and the SEC have grappled with the inflation issue. In 1974 there was a FASB proposal for price level adjusted financial statements; in 1976 the SEC established requirements for disclosing replacement cost information; and for 1978 the SEC requires that present values of proved reserves be reported.",,American Petroleum Institute

The present name was adopted in 1952 and in 1976 the function was placed under the jurisdiction of the Division of Continuing Education. The original objective was to provide a coordinating and instructional function to train field level people of the petroleum industry. The service was charged with the responsibility of identifying qualified personnel, hiring and training them as instructors to teach schools selected and supported by industry. These instructors traveled to those areas where instruction was needed and conducted schools in whatever facilities they could borrow, rent or lease. With the technological advances brought on during World War I1 and the Korean War, these instructors found themselves rapidly getting out of date. In order to provide up-to-date technology it was obvious that PETEX schools needed to be taught by people more closely involved with day-to-day petroleum operations. With support from industry and working through the petroleum trade associations PETEX in 1954 and 1955 established three residential-type schools, Drilling Technology, Production Technology and Pipeline Technology. With the advent of residential-type schools, in addition to providing fee-paying students, the concept of industry support was enlarged toproviding highly qualified personnel who could teach short segments of the schools,providing guidance in the form of advisory committee personnel who could monitor and keep up to date the curriculum, andproviding guidance in the preparation of training media and materials to augment the schools.Until 1975 PETEX training was limited to the State of Texas because the organization was supported by funding through the Texas Education Agency. In 1975 PETEX withdrew from assistance given 5y TEA and currently receives no support from any taxing agency, either State or Federal, and operates solely on a cost-recovery basis. Since petroleum industry companies operate on an interstate and international basis PETEX could not be limited to Texas and provide the service necessary to support the industry. Schools attract students from all the oil producing areas of the free world and training materials are sold worldwide.From 1956 to 1972 PETEX1s growth and spread to additional areas of training was rather slow. Until the late 60's and early 70's PETEX1s activity was confined to working with the American Petroleum Institute's Production Department and Transportation Department and the International Association of Drilling Contractors. The late 196o1s and early 1970's brought about greatly increased interest in training in many different phases of the petroleum industry. Other trade associations expressed a desire to secure quality training and PETEX1s list of cooperating agencies started to grow. Schools were added for the Gas Processors Association in 1969, the Southern Gas Association in 1972, the Petroleum Industry Electrical Association in 1975 and the Association of Oilwell Servicing Contractors in 1979.

A.),,,,,,API-79-K001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"It is always a pleasure to take part in one of these annual meetings, but doubly so when one has the privilege of sharing the same platform with such distinguished members of government and academia as Congressman Breaux, Under Secretary Joseph and Dr. Weidenbaum.My assignment today is to outline for you Exxon's view of the Nation's energy outlook. In so doing, I plan to focus on three areas :Energy demand, including a look at energy conservation;Energy supply, with emphasis on oil and some comments .on synthetics; and, finally, someImplicationsof these forecasts, both short and long range.As part of our normal planning cycle, we prepare regular assessments of the Nation's energy environment for 10 t o 15 years into the future. Necessarily, of course, such assessments are closely linked to specific assumptions about key factors that could affect the energy future. In our current outlook, for example, we have assumed a reasonable degree of economic and political stability, slower growth in the Gross National Product, environmental policies compatible with economic growth, and the availability of oil imports.Our forecasts are not intended to be firm or final. We try to maintain a rolling assessment of the future. Not only are we dealing with a moving target-- demand -- but also no single view of the future can adequately accommodate complexities of the energy problemLet's look first at the present pattern of U.S. energy consumption and how our energy is being used:Slide 1: Where Does Our Energy Go?Energy demand in our economy falls into four consuming sectors:TheNonenergy Sector, which accounted for 8 percent of demand last year, consists of oil, gas, and metallurgical coal used as feedstock or raw materials, rather than fuel.TheIndustrial Sector, which accounted for 32 percent of demand, includes all U.S. manufacturing and mining industries.TheTransportation Sector, with 26 percent of the energy demand, includes the fuel needs of all vehicles that transport people and commodities.TheResidential/Commercial Sector, the largest consumer of energy in our economy, accounted for 34 percent of demand. It covers the energy use of most public and private buildings.The annual growth rate of energy demand is projected to be somewhat over 2 percent a year between now and 1990, which is barely more than half the growth rate (of 4.1 percent) experienced during the 1960-1973 period prior to the Arab embargo. (In the wake of the embargo, during the 1973-1977 period, the growth rate dropped to 0.7 percent.) This slowdown in growth is expected to stem in part from higher energy costs, the reduced economic growth just mentioned, and energy conservation.Even with the slower growth rate, we'll still require about a third more energy in 1990 than we are now using. The nation consumed 39 million barrels a day of oil equivalent last year. We expect demand of 51 million barrels a day in 1990.Since conservation will have such a significant impact on future energy growth, let's examine its effects for a moment or so. The conservation challenge, of course, is one of obtaining a more efficient use of energy while maintaining an adequate rate of growth in the economy.",,American Petroleum Institute

Joseph(Department of the Interior),,,,,,API-79-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"These are unusual times in our national history. Wherever one goes -- whether in small towns or large cities, on rural farmlands or in crowded ghettoes-- the American people are struggling with contradictory perceptions of the national well being.It is a time of abundance, yet it is a time of scarcity.It is a time of compassion, yet it is a time of selfishness.It is a time of confidence, yet it is a time of distrust.It is not surprising, therefore, to find the American people reevaluating their institutions and demanding that they justify their continued existence in accordance with four basic standards:What social. good do they serve?How do they distribute their resources among those from whom they derive their legitimacy?What standards are normative in distinguishing between private interest and the public good?What is being done to improve efficiency while at the same time guaranteeing equity?It is altogether fitting that these questions are being directed not simply to social welfare agencies, but to private and public institutions as well. Wherever we are and whatever we do, we are under a new public scrutiny with new standards of public accountability. So it is with this in mind that I turn to the issue of oil and gas production and the role of the Department of the Interior, both as it relates to its present mission and as envisioned in the President's proposal for an expanded Department of Natural Resources.I was born and raised in Louisiana, so I grew up in the shadow of oil wells and learned at an early age to appreciate the impact of petroleum development on the State's economy. In the last few years as I have had to make difficult national decisions regarding both conservation and development, I have also come to appreciate the wisdom of Theodore Roosevelt's admonition that conservation means development as much as it means protection. The public's demand for balance and common sense in managing natural resources has a long legislative and judicial history. Both Congress and the courts have directed us to recognize the needs of multiple publics and to consider the wide diversity of resource values before making decisions about what best serves the public interest.As a former business man, I know firsthand the importance of fulfilling one's responsibility to shareholders. As a government executive, I find that while I do not have shareholders, I am responsible to a wide variety of stakeholders -- constituent groups with a stake in how we manage the Nation's resources. These constituents in the natural resource sector include those who believe that mineral resources should be exploited to the limit. It includes those who believe that wilderness is the only answer to maintaining an area?s natural integrity. It includes wildlife interests who want habitat for wildlife, and ranchers who need public lands for grazing. It includes fishermen and hunters, recreationalists and farmers. It is our job to balance those different interests and, to the best of our ability, to make decisions which benefit the Nation as a whole, not only for now, but for the future. The time has come to end the polarization which results from the characterization of resource decisions in doctrinaire environment versus development terms. What the public needs and what we at Interior seek is to develop needed energy resources as fast as is administratively achievable and in such a way as to protect other resource values at the same time.",,American Petroleum Institute

Smith(Federal Energy Regulatory Commision),,,,,,API-79-M001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1979,"IntroductionBefore launching into the what we're doing and how we're doing- it description, I do want to note two things. . First, the Commission took no position on whether the NGPA was a good bill or a bad bill, and I'm not here to defend it today. It is useful, however, as someone who was faced with the prospect of another contentious biennial review of producer prices and the increasing frustration of diverging inter- and intrastate market prices and supply, the NGPA was a relief -- of sorts. We were forced to exchange old, familiar problems for new, challenging ones. The second point is that the FERC has a strong commitment , to making the NGPA work. We realize that not everyone is pleased with the compromise the Congress reached, but it is the law of the land and we take very seriously our responsibility to implement and enforce the provisions of the Act.I would like to divide the NGPA in to three categories of action for the omission---the Title I pricing mechanism and state determination process,non-Title I activities that are governed by statutorily controlled deadlines, such as Titles II and IV andthe remaining miscellaneous items that require Commission attentionUnfortunately, I'm afraid that each of these three divisions is like a new hatchling, whichever one yells the loudest gets the Commission's attention. As a result, the public has no clear perception of the Commission's order of procedure or its progress to date. I hope to clear up some of that confusion today.Title I of the NGPA lists the various categories of gas and the ceiling prices applicable to each. Those prices became effective December 1, 1979. The act was passed November 9, 1979. The Commission panicked on November 10th. (work commences earlier).Nonetheless, we were able to implement the pricing structure by December 1st through the use of interim regulations. These rules are now in effect and seem to be working quite well, but they must be finalized. The comment period ended on January 31, 1979, and the staff is now in the process of evaluating the written and oral submissions. Staff will present proposed final regulations to the Commission for our consideration sometime in the future. I would not predict a large number of drastic changes, but let me outline a couple of the areas of difficulty that we must re-examine.The regulation that has generated the greatest confusion is the definition of a first sale as it applies to production by pipelines and their affiliates, known as the attribution rule. The NGPA establishes prices for all first sales, and all sales are first sales, EXCEPT sales by pipelines, EXCEFT that a pipeline sale can be a first sale if the natural gas is attributable to the pipeline's own production.The interim regulations contain a rule, B 270.203, that implements this provision of the NGPA. I call this a case of doing something bad to avoid doing something dreadful. Others call the rule ridiculous, absurd, illegal, untenable, unworkable, and unrealistic. I anticipate the final regulations will be modified, but let me show you how we got into this box.",,American Petroleum Institute

Mott(Texaco Inc.),,,,,,API-80-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"I propose to talk to you today about recent advancements in deep water technology and to forecast some of the developments which I believe will occur during the decade of the 1980's.Exploration DrillingIn the past, exploratory drilling technology has developed well in advance of the technology and needs for development drilling, producing, storage and loading facilities in deep water. This is exemplified by the fact that exploratory wells have now been drilled in water depths approaching 5000', whereas the deepest water in which current production emanates is slightly over 1000' of water.The current deep water drilling record of 4876' was established during the summer of 1979 by Texaco Canada, Inc., as operator for a group of Canadian companies offshore Gander, Newfoundland. That well, known as Blue H-28, was drilled by The Offshore Co. Drill Ship Discoverer Seven Seas to a total depth of 20,023 feet, commencing on April 28, 1979 and terminating August 25, 1979, or slightly less than 4 months.Several unique problems were encountered in planning for and in drilling this well. Among these were:The well was located in Iceberg Alley which had an effective drilling period with minimum iceberg exposure of 5 to 6 months. Even during the optimum period however, icebergs are present. To overcome this hazard, an additional supply vessel was engaged and equipped to tow small icebergs out of the path of the drill ship if they appeared to endanger the vessel. Also, means of locating and monitoring the paths of the bergs were provided. During the 4 months that the drilling vessel was on location four icebergs were towed out of the path of the drill ship; the largest of these was estimated at 400,000 tons. Additionally, provisions were made to cease the drilling operation, disconnect the riser, and move the drilling vessel out of the way of oncoming icebergs which were larger than the towing vessel could handle. Special studies were made to determine the maximum speed the drill ship could move with essentially the entire riser suspended without overstressing or damaging the riser.The area offshore Newfoundland is also subject to severe winter storms and varying current conditions which far exceeded those in which the D. P. drill ship had worked previously. Current measurements, wave measurements and oceanographic studies were made over a year in advance of drilling to evaluate the effect of the anticipated environmental conditions on the drilling operations. Special studies of these data dictated that shut down and riser disconnect conditions be defined and issued to the drilling vessel to insure that the riser was not overstressed.",,American Petroleum Institute

Katz(ARCO Oil and Gas Company),,,,,,API-80-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"Enhanced oil recovery methods (EOR) hold promise for recovering oil remaining after conventional recovery techniques. Steamflooding, in-situ combustion, carbon dioxide miscible flooding, and micellar-polymer flooding appear to have the most potential. These recovery techniques are not recent inventions. Research on all these methods began in the 1950's and has continued more or less uninterrupted to the present. With the exception of steam injection , EOR methods have not yet been a significant factor in U. S. oil production. They are more costly and uncertain than conventional recovery methods and in the past have not been economically attractiveChanges are occurring in both oil price and oil supply which will affect the future of enhanced recovery application. The decontrolled oil price has changed by a factor of 4.5 in real terms relative to oil price at the beginning of 1970. Oil supply shortages starting in 1973 renewed interest in EOR methods and resulted in an increased level of industry and government research and field testing. It is too early to see what effect the oil price increases of 1979 will have. An additional significant development in EOR economics is the windfall profits tax incentive for EOR projects. For several projects, the incentive will greatly reduce the economic risk and should result in some large scale projects being initiated as soon as logistics will allow.It is the intent of this paper to summarize the state of technology for EOR processes, to discuss the effect of the windfall profits tax on EOR timing, and to mention some of the operating problems expected.EOR PROCESSES,/u&gt;Steam injection is the most proven of all the EOR methods and has enjoyed by far the most commercial success. Technical information on this process began to be published in the late 1950's and operators began serious consideration of field applications in the early 1960's. Initially, steam was used for huff and puff well stimulation. Although results were not good in every case, they were economic in enough cases to spur rapid development of the process. As the heated zones around wells merged, operators began to convert to continuous steam injection. Since 1968 there has been a large increase in continuous steam injection for steam flooding. In early 1978 there were at least 100 active steam injection projects, accounting for approximately 230,000 barrels a day of oil production.' Of this total, about 150,000 barrels a day was attributable to continuous steam injection.Field testing of the in-situ combustion processes in the United States dates from the early 1950's and since that time there have been more than 100 field trials. Generally, performance has not been sufficiently good to be economically attractive considering the relatively high front-end investment for air compressors and the oil prices that have prevailed in the past. In early 1978 there were only 16 active in-situ combustion projects accounting for approximately 10,000 barrels a day of oil production.1Carbon dioxide flooding is a self-generating miscible displacement process which can result in very high displacement efficiencies. The process is applicable to low-to-moderate viscosity oils. Carbon dioxide miscible flooding is semi-proven with about 15 field trials to date. The majority of these carbon dioxide miscible projects were small pilot tests of tertiary recovery in waterflooded reservoirs, and most projects were initiated in the 1970's.",,American Petroleum Institute

Despite a tragically counterproductive excise tax, rampant inflation, breakaway Interest rates, legislative problems in Washington and elsewhere and environmental constraints that sadly add to our nation's energy problem, we -- the oil and gas operators, drilling contractors and oilfield service and supply companies -- are having a hard time believing we're not entering a millennium of sorts. And in a way, that's O.K. When times are too good, we tend to forget that, even as huge as our industry is, we're only a small cog in a pretty big wheel.The point is, while we're experiencing flush times these days, we all should remember that there have been other so-called rosy times in the past. Contractors particularly should remember that those brief periods were separated by much longer and less successful periods. Like the mother rationing her Sunday dinner, we might be wise t o look forward occasionally for that historical cyclical slowdown in oil and gas exploration and production and the resulting economic and operations problems.The U.S. contract drilling industry , both onshore and offshore, has never been more ready to tackle increased demand for its equipment than it is today. We've got the rigs and, for the most part, we've got the personnel to man them. What's more, we're accelerating the technology of oil well drilling much more rapidly than in the past, thanks in a major degree to the research and development efforts of you, the oil and gas producers, as well as some of our own successful work. We are ordering more efficient rigs, we're purchasing state-of-the-art support equipment, and we're meeting the challenge of the increased drilling pace wherever it takes place.But, like other, particularly high-technology industries, the drilling business is not without burrs under its saddle. We're growing very quickly, and many of our problems reflect those that are typical of growth industries.For the first time in 23 years, the Hughes Tool Co. count of rotary drilling rigs actually turning to the right in the C.S. is hovering around the 2,700 mark. The last time the count passed that mark was in 1956.It's been a long, dry 23 years, as any drilling contractor can tell you, and it's a far cry from the all-time low of 814 rigs working in 1971. The weekly average for the total year was a mere 975 rigs.It is encouraging to the U.S. drilling contractor that he has a growing market for his equipment once again.Forecasts for 1980 and beyond take an even more optimistic tone. We've seen the forecasts in the press. They range from a Hughes forecast of (2,450-2,500) average for the year to such super-optimistic predictions as 2,700 rigs, made recently by a New York oil analyst who's been right more often than not with his predictions.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lesch(Hughes Tool Company),,,,,,API-80-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"Technical Challenges of the 80?sThe challenges that must be met by the manufacturers and suppliers of petroleum equipment and services to meet our national goals are formidable, but I am optimistic that they can and will be met. Our industry has traditionally been faced with difficult technological and economic problems but we have managed to solve most of the problems through our innovative and entrepreneurial abilities. I am confident that this experience, coupled with our technological capabilities will allow us to meet the challenges of the 80's.To find and develop the necessary petroleum reserves for the 80's will require drilling deeper wells in more hostile environments. We will be challenged by what one might characterize as a frontier situation increasing water depths, drilling in the hostile Arctic areas and in waters where icebergs must be dealt with. We will need to explore deeper onshore horizons in more difficult topographical areas. Not only will it be necessary to drill under these difficult conditions, but we must find ways to more economically produce and market the petroleum products. These conditions impose severe demands on drilling and production equipment. The deeper wells will challenge our drilling and production capabilities because of higher downhole temperatures, greater capacity requirements on surface equipment, and more critical demands on the associated downhole equipment. Drilling fluids, tools, and elastomers will need to withstand higher temperatures and greater stresses. Drilling in deeper waters will require the development and refinement of better and more economical drilling and production platforms. Present industry efforts in the development of tension leg and guyed tower platforms for deep water drilling and production are manifestations of the need to solve this requirement. Technological advancements in subsea production equipment will result in many of the theoretical things discussed in the 70's becoming a reality in the 80's. Political and economic conditions are emerging which will make subsea production systems an exciting market area in the years ahead. It appears that the wet systems will dominate with remote control and sophisticated acoustic telemetry systems becoming commonplace. The industry challenge will be to economically produce from smaller and more marginal fields with subsea production systems while meeting the reliability and safety requirements.Increased drilling from platforms will necessitate improved drilling fluids to minimize torque, drill string and casing wear in highly deviated holes. The industry will be challenged to develop on-platform environmentally acceptable processing systems to handle disposal of waste materials such as drill cuttings, drilling fluids and other chemicals. Because of the extremely high cost associated with deep water offshore and onshore remote areas, plus liability concerns, there is a greater need for development of more reliable and accurate monitoring while drilling systems than we have today. It is imperative that we develop reliable systems with higher data transmission rates so that we can monitor more than just directional drilling data. We need reliable, accurate and fast downhole means for hydrocarbon detection to insure proper control of the well at all times to avoid embarrassing and damaging oil spills.",,American Petroleum Institute

Withers(Sun Production Company),,,,,,API-80-G001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"Due to higher gas prices and higher natural gas demands, both commercial and lease fuel, an emphasis will be placed on lease energy conservation within Sun Production Company in the 1980's. This paper describes some of Sun's energy related assumptions and philosophies. It describes pressures working for and against energy conservation in lease operations and what Sun is doing or will do to counteract these pressures working against our energy conservation goals. The four basic types of oil field energy conservation measures are discussed with specific examples of conservation techniques used by Sun. Included in the Appendix are lists of conservation measures by types which can be used by engineering and field personnel to surface conservation opportunities.INTRODUCTIONSince 1973, the production of oil in the United States has been on the decline. Every year each barrel and MCF is more difficult to obtain. We are now lifting more fluid from greater depths. As prices of oil and gas rise, the economic incentives are there to go to higher volume lift and enhanced recovery, which means we must handle our fluids in the most efficient manner to maximize our profits and minimize our energy usage.In 1960, Sun was lifting 1.5 barrels of water for every barrel of oil. By 1973, this ratio had risen to 3.5/1. In 1979, it was 7.7/1. It is projected that this ratio will double every ten years, made feasible by escalating oil prices. Until recently, lease gas was plentiful and cheap. Governmental controls of gas prices led to the inevitable waste and/or misuse of gas. Even though gas prices were low, Sun started its active lease energy conservation program in 1974. The major emphasis to date has been placed on reducing fuel gas. The fuel usage categories are field compressors, oil treating, artificial lift, heaters and dehydrators, and gas engines for plunger pumps.SUN'S ASSUMPTIONSAs we go into the 1980?s, Sun has made some energy related assumptions. Sun suggests that the inevitable higher oil prices will create higher water product ion, infill drilling, developments in enhanced recovery, increased lease energy consumption and new energy conservation technology. The water handling facilities are going to be larger and will include more sophisticated process equipment. The better water handling systems will be needed to minimize the reinjection of high priced oil back down the injection wells. As oil prices rise, so will the cost of goods and services. Because of these costs, protecting equipment by proper design and preventative maintenance will be stressed. No longer will we have the luxury of off the shelf replacement or any downtime waiting on parts. The downtime we have may mean that a high priced barrel of oil has been flooded past our producing well, never to be recovered.A good energy program leads to operating wells and leases more efficiently, such that these wells and leases can be produced longer, yielding more oil and gas before the economic limit is reached. Thus, operational efficiency is synonymous with energy conservation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Sanders(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-80-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"Recruiting, employing, and training of field personnel is conducted in various ways throughout Shell Oil Company. One of the ways that has proven highly successful is utilized in the Total Staff Concept organization at the Thomasville Plant and Production Unit - Rankin County, Mississippi. This paper will describe the Staff Concept with special emphasis given to the classroom and on-the-job training features. The intensive training program, coupled with meaningful job performance evaluations and salary administration on an individual employee basis, has resulted in a highly motivated work force.INTRODUCTIONIn 1969, Shell discovered the Thomasville Field about 18 miles southeast of Jackson, Mississippi. The sour gas (28 t o 46% H2S) is produced from the Smackover formation and is processed in a 100 MMCF/D Sulfur Recovery Plant. Startup occurred in May 1972, at which time the Total Staff Concept'' was initiated in the Plant and Field Operations. This was the first time this type staffing concept was introduced to the Shell Production organization. By Total Staff it is meant all employees in Plant and Field Operations would be paid on a monthly basis and would be subject to personnel policies normally reserved for staff employees with nonexempt status. As non-exempt staff, these employees would be paid in accordance with overtime and shift differential policy provisions. The concept was designed to eliminate artificial distinction in personnel policies existing between staff and hourly employees, e. g., at that time, no waiting periods for illnesses, personal leaves with pay, and other fringe benefits reserved for staff employees. The concept provided for an intensive on-the-job and classroom training program (on company time and expense ) coupled with meaningful job performance evaluations directly related to the administration of salaries on an individual employee basis. Recognition of performance is realized by providing an outstanding salary category where 20 percent of the employees can be administered. All employees in the concept are titled Technician. The concept is especially applicable and helpful in assisting in upward mobility of these employees by a systematic, planned, on-the-job training program and salary program geared to superior performance. The result of this concept is a highly motivated work force.DISCUSSIONStaff Planning and Employment PracticesSelection of Thomasville employees actually begins at the Staff Planning sessions held each year in November. Increase or decrease in field manpower levels are projected in these sessions and approved for the following year. Affirmative action goals for minority and female hires for producing operations are carefully considered in the staff plans. Following approval of these plans, searching for and hiring new employees begins. Some recruiting for field personnel is done at Thomasville and other locations in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. However, the number of acceptable candidates applying at Thomasville normally exceed the available openings. New employees are usually high school graduates. Many applicants have completed a two year trade school course and some have college degrees. Applicants with prior oil field and/or gas plant experience are given special consideration.",,American Petroleum Institute

Mitcham(ARCO Oil and Gas Company),,,,,,API-80-I001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"IntroductionARC0 Oil and Gas Company or AOGC has been facing a shortage problem in regard to trained manpower in its offshore operations. This is due to rapid expansion efforts in several areas of operations and the inability to retain trained manpower on Upper Cook Inlet platforms. The South Alaska Operations Group felt that it must seek an organized training approach as a solution to these problems. They realized that this systematic training approach would need to satisfy current training requirements and would also provide a way to solve future training problems.A systematic training program was already being implemented in our North Slope operations at Prudhoe Bay. The Operations Training Group had hoped to modify the existing program to meet South Alaska requirements, but after thorough investigation we discovered this program was not the answer to the problem. The existing training programs on the North Slope were tailored to the unique needs of the Prudhoe Bay installation and would not directly apply to the Cook Inlet and other offshore operations. These factors led us to the creation of a new training program called STEP.STEP is an acronym for Systematic Training and Evaluation Program. This program was formulated to maintain a completely objective training program. We believe that this program will satisfy both the present and future needs of AOGC. The following discussion will concentrate on the problems, objectives and solutions through use of the STEP program first in the Cook Inlet in Alaska then in our lower 48 offshore operations.Upper Cook Inlet - AlaskaProblemThe need for a systematic approach to training in the Cook Inlet operations manifested itself in three major areas. These three areas were safety and proficiency levels, turnover, and to maintain union free status. Each of these facets of the problem were equally important and any one of these three problem areas could have been damaging to operations.Management was deeply concerned about the proficiency level and safety of the personnel who did occupy the operator slots. Employees in these positions were not adequately trained and knowledgeable enough to be considered completely competent. Since these employees had spent a minimal time in operations and had received primarily on-the-job training, there was some doubt on the part of management as to the employee s' performance capabilities.Another portion of the problem was the exodus of trained competent operators from Cook Inlet to the North Slope. This was caused mainly by differences in the wage market. North Slope operators were paid on a different scale and were performing functions similar to the operators in the Cook Inlet. Since the work schedule of seven days on - seven days off was the same in both locations, the operators felt that the North Slope area was more attractive. The operators who remained were rapidly approaching retirement age and there was no trained work force to fill these vacancies.",,American Petroleum Institute

Bounds(Zapata Off-Shore Co.),,,,,,API-80-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"I was invited to talk today on the subject of how training program results are evaluated from an operations management point of view in the contract drilling business.Before I talk about evaluating a training program, let me first talk about the objectives and start-up plans that must be considered.First, and most importantly, if a training program---any program for that matter---is to succeed, management must make a strong commitment. Commitment of financial resources (nothing worth having is cheap), and commitment of human resources, (nothing worth doing is easy). These commitments---financial and human---are definite requirements and are necessary for any training program to succeed.We at Zapata feel that all drilling contractors, and in fact, all firms in the petroleum business, contractors and operators alike, have a responsibility to the industry and to the economic welfare of our country to make a strong commitment to training our people.We at Zapata have spent over One Million Dollars a year on training since we began our program in 1977.Our motives behind making this commitment are really very simple and basic. First, there has been and will continue to be a shortage of skilled labor. Secondly, technology used in our business has advanced considerably in the past decade and is expected to accelerate in the future.Third, teaching people and helping them to develop and expand their knowledge and skills will usually motivate them towards doing a more efficient, effective and profitable job. Last, but very importantly, the cost efficiency and job effectiveness of firms in the petroleum industry are very important factors in our effort to improve our energy supply situation---better trained people result in a better effort!If training programs didn't impact favorably on the bottom line, there would be pressure to do less, but training does, in fact, impact favorably on the bottom line. I feel that it?s one of the most important investments we're making in our company today. We're developingour humanresources in order to do a better job of finding yournaturalresources, and that makes good sense to me.Let's get back t o the basic elements of a training program. I think of our training efforts in terms of five basic questions :(Slide #1)Objectives---What do we want and expect from a training program?How will it be developed, implemented and managed?How much will it cost?How can the results be measured---are they satisfactory?Are operations and profits improving?We expect that an effective training program will impact favorably on these important objectives.(Slide #2)Reducing personnel turnoverIncreasing promotions from withinDecrease in accident frequency and costsReduce equipment downtimeTighten control of overall rig operating expensesI will discuss the effectiveness of our training program in meeting the above objectives shortly. But before that I'd like to discuss the structure of our training program and the types of training that we're involved with. We utilize three types of training methods:",,American Petroleum Institute

We makehigh quality equipmentfor the oil-gas industry.That's our business,/u&gt;. When we began to formulate and update our business plan for the future we kept requiring more and more people with still more skills. We have grown from 800 to 3,600 employees in only eight years. When we broke our future people requirements down in detail and reviewed the possibility of finding that many already trained people,we quicklyrealized that our futuresuccess in a very large waydepended on our ability to train existing employees and recruit and train new employees.We took a good look around our industry and other areas to see what they were doing to meet their requirements.There are many excellent training programs in industry and the number is rapidly revising. Less successful training programs often seem to be detached from the companies real main stream of activity. It was as if the training function was a necessary low priority evil and was a good place to pasture problems.Statements like Lack of Management Support from training people were reflective of how some training programs had declined. We felt it was often caused by the training section not closely tailoring their function and services to the company's actual needs or objectives.Oftentimes, it appeared that training covered much more material on a particular job than was actually required. Some employees received training, but often that training was directed at the jobs the training people thought were important years ago, while large new groups of employees received no training at all.We believe that top management must issue clear directives and work closely with the training function in order for any training program to be successful for both the company the student.Making decisions about our own program's purpose and direction has not been easy. In fact, I would say it has made it harder by forcing us to make choices, design our programs and facilities carefully, and really finding out what our departments management, and customers needed from us.So I would like to tell you today about what we are doing in training at Hydril and how we came to where we are in less than two years. Our program design efforts are still in the early stages, but the basic thrust and form training is taking at Hydril is worked out in a clear way and it has top management support and involvement. We are an active part of the team.Let me go through the steps we followed in getting to where we are. What I would like to call a tailored approach to the training function, If your company is building or revising a training program the first thing I would tell you isto look around. Training is like a wheel in one way at least; it's been invented. So we started visiting different companies, attending training association meetings, and conventions, talking to training people, seeing what they were doing and getting some idea of how effective different approaches were.",,American Petroleum Institute

Paramore(Halliburton Company),,,,,,API-80-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 13-16 April, Dallas, Texas",1980,"It is indeed a pleasure and an honor to be invited to participate with such a distinguished gathering. And, I am delighted to be talking about the outlook for oil field services during the 1980?s, because the outlook is good--very good. Despite everything the government could do--regulation, confusion, excise taxes, et cetera, drilling in the U. S. is on an upbeat; and it seems that it will continue that way unless some presently unforeseen, adverse political or economic event intervenes. Foreign markets offer the same encouraging prospect.Restated, my topic boils down to: The Energy Crisis-- What Does It Mean to the Oil Services Industry? It must be recognized that there is an energy crisis and that it will remain with us through the indefinite future.Given that fact, it is hard to conceive of a greater political and economic necessity than the development of new and more diversified sources of crude oil and natural gas. It is already evident that rising costs are changing lifestyles and will change them even more, with unpredictable social consequences. But, higher costs are not the only problem. What would happen if the Western world were deprived of access to Middle Eastern crude--or faced with the prospect of being denied access?It seems, therefore, that we should wring every available barrel out of our domestic resources. Increase secondary, tertiary and whatever other recovery system is needed to produce that last barrel out of the ground. Explore more-- everywhere.The fundamental message to the oil services industry is to be ready to provide more of everything, the world over, to support the higher levels of exploration, production, and enhanced recovery that the crisis is generating.At this point, I probably should stop and define oil field services and products as I use the term.I am eliminating drilling and drilling hardware, i.e., rigs, bits, pipe, tubing, etc. Although many of my comments are equally applicable to these areas, I am concentrating more specifically on drilling muds, logging, testing, completing, perforating, cementing, and stimulation products and services. They are used in the drilling of new wells--where they account for about 20 percent of the total drilling cost. They are also used in remedial work on old wells and in secondary and enhanced-recovery projects.The experience of Halliburton shows that nearly half of its domestic revenues comes from work on old wells. The point IS: Don't look solely to new wells or rig count as a measure of the total market. The reworking of old wells could be equally important over the next several years. And, on top of that, there are the secondary and enhanced-recovery markets.Let's look at that first market: new wells. Exploration and development budgets of producers have increased dramatically. Estimates of the amount of domestic drilling activity in 1980, made as recently as mid-1979, are proving to be low, and this is being reflected in upward adjustments to current and longer range projections.",,American Petroleum Institute
882,321415,,Status And Outlook For Oil Recovery By Injection,Charles S. Matthews(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-81-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"INTRODUCTIONCommercial oil recovery by use of steam began in the U. S. in 1960 when Shell achieved success in their first field trial. This first project was located in the Yorba Linda field in Southern California. Since that time, steam injection has grown to play a major role in oil production. In this paper we will trace the history of this growth and will take a look at the future. We will also discuss possibilities for further enhancing production via steam and will consider constraints to that growth.HISTORYThe Period 1960-1970The early years of steam injection were a time of great experimentation with various types of reservoirs and oils. Many of these trials were successful. One reason for early success was the fact that results of laboratory research and theory were used to guide these field trials.Steam soak (cyclic steam injection) was widely tested in this period. There are still important steam soak operations in a number of fields where first injection was in the period 1960-1970. Among these are the following (with approximate 1980 steam soak production in parenthesis): Cat Canyon (7,000 B/D), Coalinga (3,500 B/D)Kern River (20,000 BID) McKittrick (5,000 G / D ), Midway- Sunset (45,000 B/D),and Yorba Linda (8,000 B/D). Santa Fe Energy is one of the largest steam soak operators with 20,000 B/D at Midway-Sunset.Along with the successes in the 1960-1970 period, there were some expensive lessons. One early lesson concerned casing. Heating during steam injection would stress low strength casing beyond its yield point. As the foreshortened casing. cooled this would develop tensile stress in excess of the tensile joint strength. Failure would occur by pin-end jump out. The problem was solved by increasing the strength in tension of the coupling joint.1During this period the industry learned which types of reservoirs were responsive to steam and which weren't. One type which did not respond was the shallow reservoirs containing extremely viscous oils ( tar sands). Extensive tests were made on U.S. tar sands during this period. Geological studies and extensive core holes were taken in nearly every major tar sand in the U. P. Much research was carried out. Field tests were conducted on tar sands in Missouri, Texas, Wyoming, California , and Utah. Results of many of these have now been published.2,3These tar sands experiences were nearly always negative. Most U. S. tar sands suffer from either extremely high viscosity or low tar saturation. Many had thief zones. Some were highly fractured.Would today's higher oil prices make U.S. tar sands viable? We think not. It appears that , in most cases, more injected energy would be required than would be recovered in the tar.Although there was little success with tar sands, steam was quite successful in. other reservoirs containing oils in the 10'-20' API range. By 1970, oil production via steam has reached a level of over 160,000 E/D, mainly in California. About 130,000 B/D was from steam soak with the remainder from steam drive.",,American Petroleum Institute

Southtern Division),,,,,,API-81-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"Deep drilling poses major problems when high temperatures, high pressures, and acid gases Are encountered below 17,000'. A combination of these items usually requires Extensive planning, exotic materials, long drilling times, and result in high costs. This paper discusses some of industry's accomplishments, current technology, and challenges associated with deep drilling And is conducted in water depths greater than 5,000'.INTRODUCTIONAmerica?s first oil well, drilled in 1859 by 'Colonel' Edwin L. Drake. Was a deep drilling Challenge to those involved. Although Drake reportedly said that they were prepared to drill to a thousand feet if necessary, oil was found at a depth of 69', approximately four months after the well was started in April, 1859. The Oil and Gas industry has continued to set depth record reaching the 10,000' mark in 193, the 15,000' mark in 1938 and the 20,000 mark was reached in 1972. Only two wells have been drilled below 30,000' in the United States. The first, a 30,050-footer in 1972, and the second , a 31 441-foot hole in 1974, were both drilled by lone star Production Company in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin.The deepest well in the world is reported to be in the Soviet Union and recently drilled below 34,448'. The target depth of this well is 49212' (15,000 meters). This well, the USSR's SG-3 wildcat on the Kola Peninsula, west of Murmansk, was spudded in May, 1970, reached a depth of 31, 725' in July, 1979, and a depth of 32, 808' in May 1980. The Soviet's have reportedly said that improved technology probably will be required if the hole is to achieve target depth.The depth of well is not the main item to measure when determining the complexity of a deep well. Any time we stretch the capability of men, equipment, and technology, it is a challenge. For purposes of this review, a deep well will physically be referred to as being deeper than 17,000'. This depth has been selected to include a majority of the wells in the Tuscaloosa Trend of South Louisiana where many deep drilling challenges exist. If acid gases (H2S or CO) are produced at bottom hole temperatures above 300 &deg; F, continuous corrosion inhibitor circulation may be required, and the well will be defined as a deep sour Gas Well( DSGW). Some companies have developed their own DSGW specifications for metallurgical control on deep, critical, acid gas wells since some requirement exceed API specifications.4. Deep drilling in certain geological areas is not new. As can be seen in Figure 1, the 20,000' drilling depth was reached over 30 years ago and the 30,000 foot depth was reached over 8 years ago. The industry has had rigs capable of drilling to 30,000' for several years. However, if the well is to be an economical success, it must be safety completed to allow long term sustained production. Therefore, for evaluation, completion, stimulation, and initial production.",,American Petroleum Institute

Harvey Jr.(Cameron Iron Works),,,,,,API-81-K001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"BACKGROUNDFire test procedures for testing valves have been available since the 1960's. Some procedures were published while others were only in draft form. Various groups such as OCMA, Coast Guard, Exxon, API Department of refining, and others were active in developing fire test procedures. Most of the procedures were for soft seated ball valves and therefore were not really suited to determine the capability of API 6A and 6D type valves to hold pressures in a fire environment. In June 1974 the Valve group to develop a fire test procedure for testing and qualifying API Spec 6A and 6D valves. The group consisted of 25 numbers with an approximate equal number of users and manufacturers.DEVELOPMENT OF API RP6FAs a starting point the task group reviewed most of the fire test procedures available. The task group concluded that none of the fire test procedures available at that time were suitable for fire testing API Spec 6A and 6D valves.The task group set out to develop a test procedure that would be more representative of the conditions a valve might see in service, when exposed to a fire. With this in mind a proposed procedure was developed which included the following main elements:Test pressure at fire condition at fire condition at 75% of valve pressure ratingValve to be closed during test at fire conditionsFlame Temperature 1400 - 1600&deg; FValve must be able to be unseated (opened ) at pressureA schematic of the test setupMost of these elements were a major departure from previous fire test procedures. In order to prove the suitability of the proposed procedure It was decided that a test facility needed to be built thru API funding at southwest Research in San Antonio, Texas. Two valves were tested in this facility with good overall results. Based on the performance of the Facility and the proposed test system it was concluded that the proposed test procedure provided a useful and meaningful way to determine the ability of a valve to hold pressure in a fire environment. The proposed procedure was approved thru ballet in API Committee #6 and issued as a tentative document API RP6F in October 1978.During a two year period after API RP6F was issued there were a total of 57 valves tested. Out of the 57 valves only 17 valves passed all the requirement of the test procedure. In November 1980 a second edition of API RP6Fwas issued without the tentative designation.It should be noted that API RP6F provided a test procedure for determining the pressure holding ability of API 6A and 6D exclusive of the end connection joints. End connection joints were exclusive because it was felt a separate study needed to be made to determine the pressure holding ability of the typical end connections used on API 6A and 6D valves.",,American Petroleum Institute

Nelson(Department of Agronomy)|Shyilon Liu(Department of Agronomy),,,,,,API-81-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"Because drilling muds are frequently incorporated into soil near well sites and because little is known about the bioavailability of metals in drilling fluids, a greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the effects of applying 3 water-base muds to 2 fertile soils on yield and metal content of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Two heat - treated, laboratory muds were prepared from barites low in toxic metals, whereas 1 drilling fluid contained a mixture of 4 low grade barites having significant levels of Hg, Zn, Pb, Cd, and was representative of a worst case situation .Muds were mixed with soil in 1:l and 1:4 ratios and unamended soil treatments were included as controls . Four or more cuttings of each species were produced over a 6-month period and yield and metal concentrations in tissue were determined for each cutting. Acetic acid-soluble, hot water-soluble, DTPA-extractable and total metals in soil were determined before and after cropping. Plants grown in mixtures containing 50% Battle Mountain drilling fluids or 20% and 50% mixed low grade barite mud had yields which were only 36 to 96% and 20 to 95%, respectively, of those from the control soils. The marked decrease in dry matter yields possible resulted from soluble salt or Na effects, Zn toxicity, and/or poor soil physical conditions. Application of moderate rates of low metal barite muds did not lower yield. The uptake of Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb, and As and the concentrations of these metals in plant leaves were related to the total amount of the metals in the rooting zone. The Cd concentrations in chard and ryegrass grown in soils treated with the drilling fluid made from four barites were 7 to 36 and 9 to 44 times higher than plants from unamended soils.Likewise, the Zn, Cu, Pb and As concentrations in chard were increased by 14 to 35, 1 to 3, 5 to 14, and 3 to 4 times by application of mixed barite drilling mud. The Zn, Cu, Pb, and As concentrations in ryegrass plants increased by 16 to 31, 2 t o 3, 4 to 25, and 3 t o 11 fold when soils were amended with the high metal mixed barite mud. These findings suggested that Cd, Zn, Cu, As , and Pb present in drilling fluids were, in part , available for plant uptake. Application to soils of drilling fluids prepared from low metal barite resulted in lower metals concentrations in plant leaves than was obtained with control soils. Mercury present in drilling fluid was not available for plant uptake. Barium, Ni, and Cr components in drilling muds were not readily taken up by chard and ryegrass. Extraction of drilling fluid or soil - drilling fluid mixtures with DTPA reagent or acetic acid was a satisfactory rapid test of availability of Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu to plants . Hot water soluble As and Ni may be useful in predicting the availability of these two elements to plants.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hartt(Florida Atlantic University),,,,,,API-81-M001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"Fatigue is a possible mode of failure for offshore structures, particularly in deep water or rough sea locations. The problem of fatigue failure occurs at welded connections, where stresses are invariably greatest. The present paper defines this problem and describes the numerous and often complex variables which have made it difficult to design against this mode of failure. The goals of API-sponsored research regarding this topic are described and then compared with other research programs such as the United Kingdom Offshore Steels Research Project (UKOSRP), The API research has focused upon a critical aspect of this overall problem which has not been addressed directly by any other research program, i.e., the development of seawater corrosion fatigue test data in the 106to 108cycles-to-failure range. Results from the API project are also discussed with regard to recently developed API fatigue design criteria; and it is shown that designers, operators, and certifying authorities can place greater confidence in these as a consequence of this work. A need for further research is emphasized, and specific topics which have evolved as significant are listed and briefly discussed.INTRODUCTIONFailure of engineering structures and components due to dynamic or time variable stressing (fatigue) has historically been an important technological problem. In the case of offshore structures, a typical example of which is shown in Figure 1, fatigue is of concern from both design and operational standpoints due to wind and wave, current, diurnal, duty loadings as well as dynamic response (vibration). For jacket- or template-type structures fabricated from tubular steel members, if fatigue cracking and failure occur it will be at the welded tubular connections, as illustrated schematically by Figure 2. Stress a t such sites is concentrated due to structural (geometrical) irregularities, and metallurgical properties may be inferior due to influence of welding.The offshore petroleum production industry has an excellent overall record with regard to avoiding fatigue failures. However, the recent thrusts into frontier type areas (deep water and rough seas) have resulted in more difficult operating conditions than in the past. Consequently, it is more important than ever that this fatigue problem be understood and that the design be based upon appropriate and realistic criteria that have been substantiated by experimental data. Accomplishment of this has been difficult, however, because of the fact that offshore structures in frontier-type locations may experience 107to 108cycles of relatively low-stress amplitude over the design life. Typical cumulative stress cycles for structures in various locations are compared in Figure 3.The objective of the present paper is to discuss the fatigue problem with regard to the integrity of welded steel in seawater and to describe recent research efforts which have focused upon investigating this mode of failure and upon developing design criteria for mitigating this damage.",,American Petroleum Institute

Indeed, there is even substantial evidence that many educators do not understand it.It follows, therefore, that neither the general public nor government is well prepared to comprehend the financial realities of an adequate energy supply. It is not recognized that the supply of energy, in any form, is determined by the long term investment to provide that supply. It is not understood that an inadequate investment relative to expanding market needs surely will lead to an eventual shortage. Nor is it realized that this economic principle applies whether the investment is made by a private industry or by a government.Proof of the consequences of underinvestment is provided by the experience of the petroleum industry in the United States since World War II. Even if unit discovery remains constant, the industry's investment devoted to the search for oil and natural gas must grow somewhat faster than market demand to assure full market satisfaction and also maintain a realistic, safe reserve-to-production ratio. But, if these costs are rising, investment must then grow still faster than demand. And, if inflation prevails simultaneously, investment must grow even faster.Since World War II discovery costs have risen and inflation has prevailed. Therefore, it was essential that investment grow much faster than demand. And, for the first decade following the war, the industry was able to meet that standard. With the removal of war-time price controls in mid-1946, prices in general began to rise and the composite price of oil and natural gas doubled in the following decade. The increase led to a larger generation of investment funds and the petroleum industry responded by more than tripling its annual investment. During the 10 year period, investment grew nearly twice as fast as demand. And, as a consequence, the industry was able to discover 50 percent more oil and gas than the market required.After the mid-1950's, however, the industry's ability to invest in the search for petroleum was severely curtailed by governmental regulation. The imposition of price controls on natural gas not only held the price of gas at an absurdly low level but actually controlled indirectly l the price of oil as well because fuel oils had to be priced competitively with gas in the market. These restraints prevented any further increase in the composite price of oil and gas for the next 15 years. Indeed, after adjusting for inflation the real price actually declined by 30 percent. Although the production of oil and gas increased by 3.5 percent a year during this period, the annual growth of production revenue was limited to only 1.5 percent by the decline of real prices.",,American Petroleum Institute

Keller(Standard Oil Company of California),,,,,,API-81-S001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"Thank you for that introduction, Rob, and thanks to all of you for the opportunity to speak to you today.In part, this is to be a welcoming speech, so I enthusiastically and warmly welcome all of you to San Francisco.Possibly, some of you are here for the first time, so I would like to say a few words about our city.Most people agree that San Francisco is special for a combination of reasons: it?s beautiful setting, its sun and fog, its parks and flowers, its Victorian houses, and its many restaurants offering so many cuisines.I hope that all of you will find opportunities to experience the city during your stay. But even if you don't step out of this hotel, one San Francisco experience is already yours: the Palace.This stylish old building is beloved by the world for its Garden Court, and has often figured in the city's history.For example, many Presidents have stayed here, and one died here1. Also, it was here that the famous tenor, Enrico Caruso, stayed 75 years ago this month on the opening night of an opera.The next morning was April 18, 1906. hat's- a famous date, because shortly after 5 a. m. there was some seismic activity in San Francisco, followed by three days of fire. The fire consumed most of the original Palace and just about everything else from the Ferry Building to Van Ness Avenue.Caruso did not endear himself to San Franciscans in this emergency. He left town on the first available train, allegedly saying that he preferred Mount Vesuvius, which was then erupting. In fact, he vowed never to set foot in San Francisco again -- and he kept h is promise.Needless to say, I hope you enjoy the city more than Caruso did, and that you will return often.Despite the approaching 75th anniversary of the earthquake and fire, the natives profess to be unconcerned and you may as well take the same official position.Should 1906 repeat itself, the citizens are unlikely' to conclude that the Almighty disapproves of San Francisco. This was made clear after the fire 75 years ago, when a verse sprang up here. It concerned a whiskey merchant named Hotaling, whose establishment was one of the few buildings not destroyed downtown. Here is the limerick: If, as they say, God spanked the town for being over-frisky, Why did he burn the churches down but spare Hotaling's whiskey? My more serious task this afternoon is to provide you with an overview of today's world energy scene and its impact on the United States.As far as I can see, the WORLD ENERGY SCENE still means the world oil and gas scene. That's because petroleum today still accounts for about 70 percent of the non-Communist world's energy consumption. While several scenarios for the future are possible, I don't think the situation will be radically different in the year 2000. Two decades from now, the chances are that oil and gas will still be providing more than half of our energy.Therefore, my subject today has to be world oil, although oil leads to other subjects. And what I will say first about oil is something we can all appreciate.Oil isdynamic. The oil business has always been complex. It is ever changing, as a result of many factors.This has become even more true in recent times with the intrusion ofpoliticsin to the business. Politics has brought new dimensions of business uncertainty.Today, governments throughout the world are involved in energy, to various degrees in different countries. These government activities have caused momentous events, especially since the early 1970s with the emergence of a strong OPEC, the use of oil by some oil-exporting countries as a political weapon, and the steep rise in world crude oil prices.",,American Petroleum Institute

Morrow(Standard Oil Company),,,,,,API-81-U001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 5-8 April, San Francisco, California",1981,"It is a pleasure to take part in your program. This examination of our nation's energy future comes at a most appropriate time.We meet today in an atmosphere of relative calm for our industry. There are many signs of contrast with the immediate past, indicating that the climate ahead should be much improved.Unlike other periods over the past eight years, no immediate supply crisis dominates our operations planning. To the contrary, crude and product stocks are more than adequate to meet near-term market demands. However, experience has taught us that our continued dependence on foreign oil can quickly change the supply outlook.With no immediate oil supply problems, criticism of our industry has become less strident. And though our image still suffers, the public's improved understanding of this country's energy problems is helping moderate the tone of comments about our industry.There is one more important area of improvement. The new administration has signaled that production and the marketplace will receive greater consideration in the establishment of energy policy. One of its first acts was to end the unwieldy oil price control program, and the day-to-day burden it imposed on our industry.These developments present new opportunities for cooperating with our Government in seeking acceptable solutions to our nation's energy problems. But the present environment also contains challenges. In return for a larger role in shaping energy policy, we will be expected to deliver on the objectives of that policy. I believe our industry will welcome that responsibility.In looking ahead at the means of fulfilling these expectations, there is no question that conventional energy sources will remain of primary importance to the United States well in to the next century. These sources--oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear and hydroelectric power-- must act as a bridge between the present and a future which may bring new forms of more readily available energy. A look at the nation's demand for energy over the next 20 years will help to define the role of conventional sources, particularly petroleum, in meeting our future energy requirements.Energy consumption is based in large part on our nation's level of economic activity. We expect 1980's gross national product of $2.6 trillion to grow in real terms at an average rate of 2.6 percent a year between now and the end of the century. Growth is expected to be slightly higher in this decade with a moderate slowdown in the 1990 to 2000 period.An historical rule of thumb suggested that energy consumption in the U. S. would increase at approximately the same rate as real GNP. From 1950 to 1973, for example, average output rose 3.8 percent annually and our energy consumption increased 3.5 percent per year.That rule was valid until 1973. Then large increases in world oil prices followed on the heels of the embargo-induced supply shortage. The rate of energy consumption hassincebeen much less than real GNP growth, a trend we expect to see for the rest of the century.",,American Petroleum Institute

A.),,,,,,API-82-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, San Antonio, Texas",1982,"It is indeed a pleasure for me to have this opportunity to discuss with you today the prospects for significantly increasing recovery in some of our mature fields by the use of chemical injection. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has been warming the bench for many years while the first team of exploratory and development drilling, stimulation, artificial lift, waterflooding, and gas pressure maintenance have been used to expand hydrocarbon resources and improve recovery. Nearly one-half trillion barrels of oil have been discovered in the Country, but it looks like nearly two-thirds of this will not be recovered with current primary and secondary producing methods. As a result of the increase in oil prices over the past decade plus the significant gains in technology that also occurred, enhanced recovery has come of age and can be expected to add significantly to recoverable reserves in the future.My comments will address primarily the challenges and opportunities for chemical enhanced recovery projects and the implications of a successful pilot test Exxon has just completed in its Loudon field.By reference to Figure 1, enhanced recovery techniques are in varying stages of development. Steam processes are well established in the heavy oil fields of California and are expected to continue to contribute significant quantities of extra oil. Combustion techniques have had success in a few fields. Large scale miscible C02operations are about to become a reality with the massive commitments of capital and manpower being used to design and implement projects in West Texas and Gulf Coast fields following successful pilot tests. Nitrogen is being used in those special cases where it is applicable, as in the Jay field in Florida. Hydrocarbon miscible projects, while equally effective in recovering oil, will have limited application because of the greater value of hydrocarbon miscible agents as fuels and feedstocks.Chemical flooding, on the other hand, is a frontier technology. While polymers have been used in several waterfloods to achieve improved mobility control, polymer flooding will have limited application. This technique recovers less than 5 percent of the original oil in place and is most effective for oil viscosities between 20 and 100 cp; thus there are only a limited number of candidate reservoirs. There may be limited use of alkaline materials to generate surfactants in situ but this process has yet to be proven. Specifically-designed surfactant systems can recover a large part of the residual oil left after water flooding and we feel that surfactant flooding will realize the greater portion of the chemical EOR reserve potential. The remainder of my talk will deal with the current status and outlook for surfactant flooding.As shown in Figure 2, many factors must be considered in designing a surfactant flood that will achieve high oil recovery and be cost effective. I will touch briefly on a few of the more significant ones that impact what I will cover during the remainder of my talk.",,American Petroleum Institute

However, over the past decade another certainty has forced itself to be added. No one can predict the price of oil.Yet the price of oil has been the underpinnings for almost every study I have seen on the rig market in recent years. Generally, these studies are discredited 6 months later when some unforeseen, but seemingly obvious circumstance, radically changes the economic structure of the industry.Today I am going t o take a look at what I see in my crystal ball and if I seem a little smug about it, it is because I am pretty confident about it . Unlike most forecasts which are based on the price of oil, my predictions are based on a long proven formula, that for lack of better label, I call gut feel .The offshore mobile rig market is currently again in a throes of change, but the more it changes, the more it is the same. We only have to go back about 6 years to find out how the rig market is going to react tomorrow.This year the offshore drilling market is being hit hard with a double whammy from which it could take up to several years to recover. First, there simply are too many rigs coming out of the shipyards and second, there is the dropping of crude prices which diminishes any hope that a sudden spurt in the exploration budgets could possibly come to the rescue .To accommodate all the projected new rigs , even if we assume a 10% Slip page and cancellation factor, exploration budgets would have to increase in the range of 30 to 35% this year (based upon the current day rate levels) . This simply is not going to happen. As you folks obviously know exploration budgets have not increased substantially this year and we have heard of several majors even revising and cutting back on budgets previously approved for 1982. Sitting on the thresh old of the second quarter, I would say the drilling market would be lucky to see a 10% overall increase in drilling budgets this year, worldwide. I might add, however, that offshore exploration budgets have shown an average annual increase of 31% ever since the Arab oil embargo in late 1973.REF: Slide 1Though there is little visible evidence of it yet, the rig market is currently in a state of over supply. Right now about 8 rigs are idle, without contracts. However, we know of another 45 to 50 units whose contracts will not be extended or who are available for immediate farmouts.Then add to these figures another 158 mobile units which are supposed to be delivered from the shipyards this year and one can easily see the specter of large oversupply looming just ahead.",,American Petroleum Institute

Thompson(Operators Inc. Tenneco Oil Company),,,,,,API-82-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 4-7 April, San Antonio, Texas",1982,"INTRODUCTIONOperators, Incorporated is a solely owned subsidiary of Tenneco Oil Company. Operators was formed in 1972 for the purpose of providing a steady work force to Tenneco's offshore, and later onshore, leases. (Prior to 1972, Tenneco used third - party companies to operate its platforms.)In 1976, Operators began to experience a shortage in trained manpower. This shortage was partly due to the rapid expansion that Tenneco, and consequently Operators, began to experience and partly due to the high demand in the oil industry for experienced personnel. The offshore operations were particularly hit by this high demand for experienced personnel. Due to this high demand, Tenneco management was forced to hire many inexperienced employees.Because of the increased number of inexperienced employees, the Company also found that the total number of lost-time accidents began to increase. In response to these conditions, the Company decided that it must provide training for their employees.At first , the Company turned to industry schools in an attempt to provide the needed training. However, after careful investigation, management found that industry schools were not meeting the needs of the Company. The Company began to look for other methods that might meet its needs. They realized that an in-house systematic training approach was required. In addition, the level of accidents must decrease. The Company felt that something must be done to directly influence the accident rate.In 1978, an in-house training program was proposed and accepted by the Company. The program was called the Modular Training Program (MTP) and was largely modeled after Mager's Criterion Referenced Instruction. A facility was also planned which would provide classrooms and living quarters. Finally, a comprehensive safety program was immediately put into effect to influence the accident rate. (A large part of the safety program is automatically built into MTP. MTP is oriented towards the safest and most effective skills possible. Because of this, the safety program will not be described in this paper. )THE FACILITYFollowing the initial recommendation to build a Training Facility, construction began in the middle of 1979 and was completed in October of 1980. The Training Facility is located on five acres of land on the west side of Lafayette , Louisiana. The 24,000 square-foot building houses the administrative offices for development and implementation. The building also contains a galley that will seat 45 people; a recreation room; twelve bedrooms capable of housing 48 trainees; two large and two small classrooms for. individualized study; a complete graphics and video department; and a large work area for hands-on training . The Training Facility contains a simulated platform immediately behind the building. The simulated platform has the gas production equipment for separating and processing compressed air, salt water, and a nonflammable liquid which simulates the viscosity of condensate. The 13,900 square-foot platform also has a helipad; three operational cranes; a well deck area; navigational lights and fog horn; water safety equipment; fire fighting equipment; the different production safety systems (safety devices, ESD, fire loop, etc.); and an electronic production monitoring system.",,American Petroleum Institute

The general design and non-design features which included the installation of safety equipment was, and still is, submitted to the U.S.G.S. for approval prior to installation. A proposed revision to OCS Order No. 8 was published in the Federal Register on December 10, 1975. This revision contained specific requirements relative to training offshore personnel in safety and pollution control equipment.Gulf's management committed themselves to comply with the proposed revised OCS Order No. 8 by initiating the training of offshore personnel with an in-house school. In reviewing what should be taught to comply with the OCS Orders, Gulf decided to expand the program to include training on the operation of producing equipment, fire fighting equipment plus crane operation and maintenance procedures. The program was expanded to seven days, the normal working tour of offshore personnel on a 7 and 7 schedule. All Gulf personnel and key contract personnel were to be trained.The first session of the Anti-Pollution Safety Device Training Program began on January 20, 1977 and was held on the fourth floor of the Gulf Building in New Orleans. As of December 31, 1981, 570 students have been through this program.Revised Federal OCS Order No. 2 stipulated that drilling personnel would be trained and updated on well control. A1though Gulf has taught and encouraged well control training for years, the OCS orders stipulated that only schools certified by the U.S.G.S. would be acceptable in teaching well control. Gulf submitted their proposed course and after a few minor refinements the course was approved by the U.S.G.S. on September 12, 1979. Through December, 1981, 92 students have been certified in the Comprehensive Well Control Training sessions and 111 have been certified in the one-day refresher session.During the planning stages of the Well Control program, Gulf decided to locate both the Anti-Pollution Safety Devices Training Program and the Well Control Training Program under one roof. Since the Anti - Pollution school had outgrown its area in the Gulf Building, a new facility was found for both programs. This facility is located approximately 10 miles from downtown New Orleans and was occupied in January, 1979 and became known as the New Orleans Training Center. The building consists of 14,500 square feet of space, and houses classrooms, offices and hands-on laboratory facilities.The New Orleans Training Center is under the Drilling Department of Gulf Oil Exploration and Production Company's South and East Offshore Division.

The remaining 90% of rigs Used diesel-driven mechanical transmissions and DC generator/motor combinations. In spite of its advantages in reliability, flexibility and reduced operating costs, its acceptance was gradual.During 1981, with significant new rig construction, the number of new rigs incorporating SCR power increased by 700 units. What brought this increase about can be attributed to several factors:. More technically-knowledgeable managers with drilling contractors influenced the purchase of the SCR system;. Good operating experience with the system;. Competitive pricing with other systems.The net result of this significant increase in SCR systems is the need to more fully understand its operation advantages and how to maintain and repair the equipment. This need exists throughout the drilling contractor organization from top level managers to rig floor personnel.Oil and gas operators should also be made aware of how the SCR system functions, since drilling performance and cost of operations are influenced by the system. Operators can save on fuel supplied, lower rig downtime and greater operational flexibility with SCR units.",,American Petroleum Institute

The Petroleum industry training system was designed to provide a cost effective approach for training those who work in the petroleum industry. Over 240 companies in 17 countries have chosen to use The Petroleum Industry training system to train their personnel.THE NEEDThe need for increased training effectiveness has been significantly impacted by the large numbers of experienced personnel who are reaching retirement; the resulting influx of untrained personnel; and, an increased awareness of the hidden costs (e. g., length of training periods, costly mistakes, turnover -- often of best trainees , etc.) of relying solely on on-the-job training. Yet, the cost and difficulty associated with training personnel can be quite high due to the following factors:Development of in-house programs can be expensive, time-consuming and can encumber key personnel.Travel, lodging and other expenses associated with the training of personnel who are located all over the world, can be quite high.Maintenance of training programs to reflect changing technology can be expensive and is often neglected.comprehension and retention of good information is often low due to poor learning design.Target audiences may vary considerably in knowledge and experience thereby creating inefficiency in the training process.Existing programs may be dated, lacking in accountability, or a mismash of information from various sources that are poorly organized for learning purposes.

The objective of this project was to develop a data base which could be used to evaluate and improve the earthquake-resistant design guidelines given in theAPI Recommended practice for planning, Designing and Constructing Fixed offshore Platforms, RP 2A. Towards this objective, the results from various recognized methods of analysis were tabulated and compared. Particular emphasis was devoted to assessing platform capacity and ductility requirements.For a complete description of the project, the reader is referred to API PRAC reports 79-26, 80-26A, and 80-26B. 'This paper briefly reviews the work that was performed, highlights key results, and offers several observations on the thoroughness and validity of earthquake-resistant design provisions in RP 2A.EXAMPLE OFFSHORE PLATFORMThe example platform was an eight-leg steel template-type structure designed for the oceanographic and seismic environment offshore Southern California in 265 feet of water. The jacket legs were sized to accommodate 66-inch diameter piles at the corners and 48-inch diameter piles elsewhere. None of the piles were considered grouted into the jacket legs, so the piles only supported the jacket vertically through welds at the tops of the jacket legs. The platform had two deck levels and two groups of well conductors.The structure was analyzed with computer program INTRA. With this program, the response of structural elements was tracked beyond their yield or buckling limits. Additionally, the jacket was considered to be supported and coupled via the piles to a nonlinear, inelastic soil system through which the earthquake motions were imparted to the steel structure. Figure 1 is a sketch of the analytical model together with some notes regarding the various finite element types that were used in the model.STAGE I ANALYSESIn the first stage of the project, the structure was analyzed for two baseline seismic load cases, a strength requirement loading by the response spectrum method and a ductility requirement loading by an equivalent static method. These are two methods of analysis commonly used in current design practice.The strength requirement specified in RP 2A is intended to insure that a platform has sufficient strength to withstand without significant damage the intensity of ground shaking which may be reasonably expected during the service life of the platform. The platform owner can determine the expected earthquake intensity by site-specific studies, or alternatively he can use the generally conservative design spectra given in HP 2A. For this study, the API design spectrum for seismic zone 4, soil type C was utilized. The response spectrum method is a linear analysis procedure, i.e., the structural responses are assumed to be directly proportional to the intensity of the applied load. Therefore, the analytical model of the example structure was linearized such that the forces and deformations in the supporting linear soil model would roughly match the forces and deformations expected from the true nonlinear soil when subjected to strength requirement loads.",,American Petroleum Institute

Mills Jr.(Rotan Mosle Inc.),,,,,,API-83-A001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"PURPOSEIn view of the current uncertainty regarding OPEC's future price/ production actions, we have attempted in this study to establish a framework with which to measure the effect of a wide range of possible OPEC actions on normalized domestic drilling rig activity . We use the term normalized because 1983 activity is being abnormally depressed by: (1) the illiquid aftermath of an oil industry that became overly dependent on abnormal inflows of outside capital and credit in 1981 and in early 1982, and (2) by the wait and see strategy adopted by many operators during the current period of major oil price uncertainty. Thus, average rig activity during 1983 is likely to fall well below normal levels , just as activity during 1981 was well above normal levels. We do not foresee these abnormal conditions continuing beyond 1983; thus, we feel that the model contained in this analysis is useful for estimating rig activity beyond 1983.ANALYSISOur analysis is contained in a series of 17 illustrations which can be grouped into three sections.Section 1deals with Figures 1 through 6. These figures develop the historical relationship that has existed between wellhead revenue and rig activity for the last 30 years. Using historical oil and gas prices and volumes and historical rig activity , shown on Figures 1 through 4, Figures 5 and 6 demonstrate that wellhead revenue projections provide a useful basis on which t o forecast normalized' rig activity . Figure 5 shows that the ratio of wellhead revenue per active rig is trending upward over time at a steady rate (approximately 9.4% per year). The equation of the trend line is a ratio) = 172.8862 + 0.089549 x (Y), where Y = the year and a ratio) = the natural logarithm of the ratio of wellhead revenue per active rig in $OOOs/day/rig. The r2 or goodness of fit is 0.989 and the standard error is 7.9%.) Figure 6 compares actual rig activity to that which would have occurred had rig activity relative to actual wellhead revenue been exactly on the trend line shown on Figure 5. Figure 6 shows clearly the abnormally high level of activity in 1981 created by the then massive availability of outside capital and credit .Section 2deals with Figures 7 through 9. These three figures are designed to allow the user to assess future rig activity relative to a wide range of assumptions about future wellhead revenue changes from the 1982 base. For example, if one assumes that wellhead revenue (net of WT) in 1984 will be 10% below its 1982 . base, one would locate the -10 curve on the left-hand scale of Figure 7 and follow this curve downward and to the right to its intersection with the 1984 vertical axis. From this intersection point, one would move horizontally to the right-hand scale and read that trend-line rig activity in 1984 would be 2,400 rigs.(Figures are available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

Since 1974 the Overthrust Belt has stimulated the imaginations of many major oil companies and independents because of a series of significant oil and gas discoveries in southwestern Wyoming and northeastern Utah. To this day, intensive exploration and development continues. Before discussing the specifics of some of the key discoveries, I would like to briefly describe the geology which gives the play its name.Figure 1 shows the extent of the Overthrust Belt. As you can see, it is not limited to a small portion of Utah and Wyoming where most of the discoveries have been made but extends from Alaska to Mexico. The same forces which caused continental drift caused the formation of the Overthrust Belt. Movement from the west to the east caused the westernmost rocks to be pushed up and over the eastern rocks. This is illustrated in Figure 2. This Overthrusting caused a 60 mile shortening of the earth's crust in the area of southwestern Wyoming. As a result, geologic traps formed which are necessary for hydrocarbon accumulation.The first Overthrust Belt gas discovery occurred in 1913 at Turner Valley, 25 miles southwest of Calgary, Canada. In 1924 oil was found beneath the gas cap. Turner Valley is the oldest oil and gas field in Alberta. It had original estimated reserves of 1.5 billion barrels of energy equivalent oil. Gas reserves from 1.0 to 1.8 billion barrels of energy equivalent oil have been discovered in Mexico's Thrust Belt. Success did not come easy in the area of southwestern Wyoming and northeastern Utah. More than 500 dry holes were drilled in the area prior to the discovery of Pineview Field by American Quasar in January 1975. Improved seismic techniques have resulted in the discovery of 25 additional fields along the 50 mile long, 10 mile wide fairway (Figure 3). Production has steadily increased from this area; today 52,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 450 million cubic feet of gas per day (MMCFD) is produced from these fields. We expect production to steadily increase since exploration and development of the fairway remains very active.There is no single formation, reservoir type or hydrocarbon type which characterizes the Overthrust Belt. Figure 4 illustrates some of the formations which are productive. They include the Cretaceous Kelvin sands in portions of Pineview Field and the Jurassic Twin Creek fractured carbonate productive in Yellow Creek, Anschutz Ranch and Glasscock Hollow Fields. The most significant sweet production in the Overthrust Belt comes from the Jurassic Nugget sandstone. It is productive in Ryckman Creek, Glasscock Hollow, Clear Creek, Painter, East Painter, Anschutz Ranch, Anschutz Ranch East, Pineview, Chalk Creek and Chicken Creek. Production is currently 47,500 BOPD and 100 MMCFD from the Nugget.(Figures are available in full paper)",,American Petroleum Institute

S. oil fields, industry will increasingly seek means by which to extend the life of these fields. Enhanced oil recovery, using carbon dioxide as the displacing fluid, is looked upon to play a prominent role. However, numerous issues concerning the technical performance of carbon dioxide-based oil recovery, adequate supplies of affordable C02, and the technical attractiveness of this approach still need to be resolved.BACKGROUNDSince the early 19701s, when oil production peaked at near ten million barrels per day, following the discovery of Prudhoe Bay, oil reserves and production have been steadily declining. The latest estimates of oil reserves show the U. S. with 29 to 30 billion barrels, a ten-year supply at current rates of consumption. While exploration will add new reserves, more efficient development of the already discovered oil will be required if oil production and reserves are to be stabilized. Enhanced oil recovery, particularly using carbon dioxide and other industrial gas, provides one important means of adding to domestic oil supplies.SIZE OF THE TARGETNationwide, the target for enhanced oil recovery includes 300 billion barrels of oil already found, yet unrecoverable with conventional production means, as well as the oil in the new fields still to be discovered. Carbon dioxide (and other gases) injection could technically be applicable to a large sub-set, nearly one-half of this target resource. In general, one would look for light oil reservoirs having sufficient depth and continuity.",,American Petroleum Institute

Mitchell(Standard Oil Co. of California),,,,,,API-83-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"INTRODUCTIONThe unique configuration and structural system of typical offshore platforms and the unique aqueous environment in which they are located require structural design considerations for resisting earthquake ground motions that differ from most other types of structures. Unlike buildings, most of the imposed load on an offshore platform is at the top of the structure. However, added mass of water around the submerged structural elements in addition to water contained within the elements significantly affects the dynamic structural response. Offshore platforms have few non-structural elements such as curtain walls and partitions to provide additional lateral resistance and structural damping of dynamic loads. Since offshore structures need to be relatively stiff to avoid resonant conditions with ocean waves, they cannot employ flexible, ductile moment-resistant framing systems which are favored for tall buildings in seismically active areas. Instead most offshore platforms which have been or are being constructed use a tubular braced frame system which is generally considered to have low ductility.Building codes provide a simple static earthquake design procedure for buildings which approximately estimates the dynamic response. This procedure, which has been developed through years of experience and research, takes into account load distributions and structural systems typical for buildings. 6uil.dings are usually designed to resist earthquakes that are likely not to be exceeded in severity during their lifetime within the elastic regime of the structural system. Special detailing requirements are specified by the codes which ensure that such buildings can develop the ductility to also resist rare intense earthquakes without collapsing. The buildings are not normally analyzed for these rare events, but experience and research have shown that when the prescribed design procedures are followed, there will be adequate ultimate resistance.These procedures for designing buildings are not appropriate for offshore platforms. Instead, the API has established guidelines in Recommended Practice RP 2A (Ref. 1) to design offshore platforms for earthquake ground motion using more complicated dynamic analysis procedures. Like buildings, the offshore platforms need to respond only to the more frequent less intense earthquakes in the elastic regime. However, the designer must demonstrate analytically that the structure-foundation system has sufficient reserve energy to resist the rare intense earthquake without collapsing.Because the guidelines in RP 2A are unique, the API through the Production Research Advisory Committee has sponsored a number of research projects (1) to evaluate the clarity, thoroughness and validity of the design provisions, and (2) to determine the post-yield and post-buckling behavior of tubular members and braced frames in order to be able to estimate the ductility of offshore structures by analytical methods. Six individual API-funded projects have been undertaken in these areas within the last 5 years and a limited participation research project funded by the participants and administered by API is about to get underway. These projects are tabulated in Fig. 1.",,American Petroleum Institute
903,321435,,Effect Of Slip On The Flow Properties Of Cement Slurries,R.J. Mannheimer(Southwest Research Institute),,,,,,API-83-H001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"What is slip and why is it of practical importance?While the exact mechanism of slip can depend on both the type of dispersed system and the type of viscometer, one simple physical explanation of slip is illustrated in Figure 1. In this case, a cement slurry has exuded a film of water that adheres to the walls of the viscometer. Despite the fact that such a thin (1 x cm) film of fluid would be difficult to observe directly, this paper will show that it can dramatically reduce the apparent viscosity that one would measure. However, slip is magnified by the small hydraulic radius (-1 mm) of a typical viscometer. Consequently, apparent viscosities, based on laboratory data, may seriously underestimate the flow resistance in large diameter pipes and annuli if slip is ignored.What are the predicted effects of slip?The theoretical behavior of a material with a yield value, but without the complications of slip, is illustrated by the darkened squares in Figure 2.*Note the characteristic flattening of the curve as the yield value (i.e., in Figure 2 the yield occurs at log 70 = 1.845) is approached. The predicted effect of a thin film (2.5 x cm) of water on the rheological properties of this same material is dramatic. In the first place, the apparent viscosity decreases with decreasing gap size (H = Rc-Rb, where Rband Rcare the radii of the bob and cup, respectively). Furthermore, the curves with slip have distinctly different shapes near the yield value than the curve for which the slip velocity (Vs) was assumed to be zero. This result is important because it illustrates that even relative changes in rheological properties can be misleading if slip is ignored. One of the most significant predictions illustrated in Figures 2 is that slip provides a mechanism by which a material can flow at shear stresses below the yield value. We will soon see (Section IV) that cement slurries exhibit many of the characteristics of slip that are predicted in Fig. 2.How can we estimate the true shear rate when slip is important?The true shear rate (corrected for slip) is the quantity (V-Vs)/H. In order to calculate the slip velocity, we will assume that the apparent viscosity is a unique function of the shear stress. Consequently, if the stress is constant, then the apparent viscosity must also be constant. Likewise, if we assume that the slip velocity is a function of the shear stress without specifying the particular functional form of this shear dependency, then it follows directly from the definition of the apparent viscosity that the slip velocity can be calculated from the differences in the apparent shear rates(V/H) for two different size gaps.",,American Petroleum Institute

Ellis(Conoco Inc.),,,,,,API-83-I001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"Changes are taking place in the oi1,industry. New technology spurred on by the microchip is changing the tasks to be performed. New employees are entering the industry to operate and maintain the new as well as the old. Current employees need instructions on the use of the new and on improving the performance of the old. My job, as well as your job, is to provide these employees with the opportunity to obtain the knowledge and the skills necessary to perform these tasks efficiently, safely and with consideration of the environment.A well planned and directed training program does pay in the oil industry. However, it should be a continuous program. There should be no cutbacks when the economy slows and/or the workload slackens. In fact, these slack periods are an opportune time to send an employee to a training session since it is easier to have other employees perform his tasks - thus obviating the need of hiring a temporary replacement. When the workload increases, better trained, more efficient employees will be available. This just could reduce the need for hiring new employees to take on the added workload.Providing relevant and timely training develops a more satisfied and secure employee. Call it esprit de corps , pride in self, or morale.It is built through individual or group accomplishment and subsequent recognition. It promotes high standards of achievement and keen competition to better oneself or one's group. We have a letter in our files from a young woman in our Hobbs, New Mexico division. She developed a tremendous pride in accomplishment after attending a one week training course. One her own, she entered the local college and obtained an associate in science degree. The result is a better trained, more dedicated employee with not only pride in her accomplishments, but also pride in her company. It is important to expose the new employees to self-improvement early in their careers - this is best done with a planned and relevant personnel development policy, of which training is an integral part.Up to this point I have been talking about intangible benefits to the company. It is difficult to put a dollar value on these; however, our files are full of training ,results and we can estimate the magnitude of the impact. I would like to share with you a few Conoco examples on which you can place a dollar value.In one area in Texas, the attendees of a short course, based on what they learned, made over one hundred modifications to the wells in their area over a two year period, increasing production in individual wells from a two BOPD increase on the low side to a 140 BOPD increase on the high side. Also, fuel costs were lowered and maintenance reduced. Use your own crude price to place a dollar value on this measurable result of training.Another example: a lease operator in our Corpus Christi division doubled production and cut energy 50% after participating in a course in which he learned how to properly time clock a well.",,American Petroleum Institute

Clegg(Shell Offshore Inc.),,,,,,API-83-J001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"INTRODUCTIONOperating personnel in the oil field have discovered that the computer is a valuable tool that is easy to use. Although using oil field computers may not be as fun as playing Pac-Man they come in very handy insolving problems,storing, manipulating and retrieving data, andin controlling equipment.Their use is now so commonplace that most of us must learn to use the computer or perish. Rather than fighting these electronic marvels, let us learn to use them effectively.Computers can be classified in a number of different ways. In order to keep things simple, let us divide them into the following hardware groups:Hand-held programmable calculator-computers. Reasonably inexpensive.Micro-computers. Moderately low cost.Mini-computers. Expensive.Large central base (main frame) computers. Very expensive.First, here are some basic definitions. A computer is more than a calculator. To be a computer, it should accept an outside software program package written in a special language. This program can be compiled and stored on a magnetic card or chip. Such programs are capable of directing the electronic package to ask for data, to make calculations and decisions and, finally, to produce answers. Computers have a random access memory (RAM) in which information can be stored or retrieved on a temporary basis. Also, they normally need a read-only memory (ROM) which is a memory chip (commonly called CROM) in which information is permanently stored. Or better yet, the computer may use an EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) which is a memory chip in which stored data can be erased and rewritten.HAND-HELD PROGRAMMABLE CALCULATOR-COMPUTERS (HHPCC)Who would have thought just a few years ago that drillers would now be routinely using HHPCC's? On close examination, however, use of computers on drilling rigs was natural -- especially if they could be made portable and were able to withstand a moderate amount of abuse. Drilling operations are normally expensive, and events often occur that need quick solutions, requiring accurate and sometimes rather complicated calculations. Numerous articles have been written on the use of these HHPCC small Computers2, 3, 4, 5 , 6. Many of these articles were written by employees of IMCO Services which has led the oil industry in developing and using calculator modules (CROM?s) in drilling operations. The HHPCC arrived in the oil field in the 1970's. The most popular (newer models) are the Texas Instruments TI-59 and the Hewlett-Packard HP-41C/CV. Operating personnel have used mostly the TI-58 or TI-59, whereas engineers tend to use the HP-67, HP-97, and HP-41C. Typical specifications for such computer hardware normally require:Simple - easy to use (this is most important).Easily portable and battery powered.Reliable with low maintenance - rugged.Low cost.Avery desirablefeature is an attachable printer. In addition to this, the computer must accept the software program from a suitable source. Several sources are available.",,American Petroleum Institute

Kaschube(Hanley and Bird),,,,,,API-83-K001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"I would like to thank the Production Department of the American Petroleum Institute for giving me the opportunity to acquaint you with the Petroleum Production Course at Bradford Area High School. This course is unique in that it represents the first vocational-technical course of petroleum production ever developed for use on a high school level. Its success has pointed the way for the establishment of similar courses in other areas.The need for this course came about during 1960-1970 when there was a shortage of skilled oil field production workers in our area. This need was brought to the attention of the area school board, and within a short period of time, the production course was established.This is a typical Vo-tech course in that approximately half of the students' time must be spent in classroom study and the remaining time in the laboratory or shop. The lab portion of this course is not typical in that the students spend this lab time on an actual oil lease owned by the school district.Incredibly, the kind of oil lease we needed was found just three blocks from the high school. It was perfect for our purpose since it included a building, producing wells, injection wells, electric jacks, a central pumping power and many other things, not the least of which were mineral rights. The total purchase price for the lease and all equipment was $40,000. A description of the lease is shown on Figure 1. The location of the lease relative to the high school is shown on Figure 2.The course itself was begun in September of 1976; however, the school did not take possession of the lease until the middle of October of 1976. The first instructor was Frealyn 0. Stark, Jr. whose name is mentioned here since it was he who insisted that a lease be acquired for actual hands-on experience by the students. Mr. Stark was admirably suited for the position of instructor since his oil field experience spanned 30 years and included everything from oil field equipment manufacturing to operating his own lease. It was his oil lease that was used for the laboratory field work during the first six weeks of the course.The fun really began when we took physical possession of the high school lease in October. The initial task was one of cleaning up a lease which had been nearly totally neglected for years. In this sense it was ideal since all wells, equipment and buildings. were in need of repair, painting, and/or replacement; but first we had to clear out the jungle and find the equipment.The lease is operated in much the same way as any other oil lease and each student (grades 10-12) performs all tasks normally required on a lease. This includes drilling, plugging, pulling pipe and tubing, setting pump jacks, small engine repairs; in general, anything and everything that can be encountered in running a lease. These tasks were not performed in a random manner, but rather follow a specific form.",,American Petroleum Institute

We've been through the crippling slump of the early 70?s, and then to the exceptional high activity of the early 80?s, and are now going back down with a steadily declining rig count due to high taxes and falling oil prices. And, we are only through the first three years of this decade.Ask any of the 14,000-plus independent producers in this country where they have been, and I suspect you will get at least 10,000 different answers -- some good, some bad, while others will probably shake their heads in bewilderment. Chances are, however, they will probably all say we have been through periods racked with uncertainty.Our nation's drilling activity peaked to new all time records in December, 1981, with a high of 4,530 operating rigs . The drilling momentum carried through into 1982 with 44,726 wells completed by the end of June, a 26 percent increase over 1981. Successful wells were up by 22 percent, gas wells increased by 24 percent, and the total footage drilled increased by 34 percent. It was t o be another record year for independents, and indeed, 1982 ended as a peak year for total wells drilled -- oil , natural gas and wildcat. However, success was , tempered by steadily decreasing crude oil prices which started early in 1982, and threatened economic difficulties because of a rapidly developing working capital crunch.But, drilling records resulted from unusual phenomena that certainly can't be used as a basis for projecting the rest of the decade. In 1981, the rig count increased from a low starting point, while i n 1982 it began a steady decline from a record high. The numbers were also padded by Johnny-come-Latelies to the industry, and fast buck promoters hoping to cash in on the boom from crude oil price decontrol. Conservation efforts were also making an impact, as was the declining prices for crude oil . At the start of 1983, there weren't many independent producers who could tell you where they'd been, much less where they were going.There were, however, some promising prospects, even though producers may not have recognized or perceived them at the time. The history and upheavals of the events of the first three years of the 80's are bringing about a leaner but healthier industry. Those who weren't trained or professional in the business are moving on, leaving the serious seasoned contenders to handle the oil patch. The cost of most field operations are declining ; contract or costs are off by as much as 25 percent, steel has discounted by 35-.C0 40 percent and the average - cost of wells has dropped substantially.",,American Petroleum Institute

Anderson(Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago),,,,,,API-83-P001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"Hearing about the prospects of your industry is as interesting for me as it is for you, because oil and banking do have so much in common, and because of Continental Bank's important position in financing the petroleum industry. What our two industries have accomplished together in energy development over many years has been important. What we have yet to accomplish from this point forward is even more important. From its inception, the energy crisis was also a financial crisis . And for nearly a decade now, oil and banking have been dealing with the situation. To some extent, our specific problems have come from being unable to wave away the world's problems. If you're a born worrier, you were born at the right time, but there is a striking similarity of recent experience in your business and mine.The similarity was such that a few years ago a couple of people in our bank who track various issues of public interest thought it would be instructive to put together an informal study of oil and banking. It took the form of a slide presentation -- replete with some of the scathing headlines, editorials, and cartoons that hit the oil industry over shortages and rising prices. In effect, it was an effort to warn bankers about the kind of reaction that can result when changing conditions upset ingrained public attitudes and expectations, whether for cheap and plentiful energy, or for cheap money and plentiful credit.That was only two or three years ago, but we had no idea then how rapidly those reactions would develop and mount, what with endemic inflation, determined efforts to contain it, high interest rates, and rapid change in the financial service industries. We also had no idea that global recession, high energy prices, increased supplies outside of OPEC, reduced consumption, high interest rates, and inventory liquidation would all combine to change So dramatically the pressure on oil prices.In retrospect, this may seem surprising, because energy has been a central part of banking considerations throughout these past 10 years. Yet as with any major development, the outlines of change are never too clear until they finally begin to take form. Then too, politics as well as economics figures in nearly all of our considerations. And while political developments are often imponderable, their effects on economic conditions are generally incomprehensible, even to politicians .Part of the riddle may be, as Peter Drucker observed, that ...economic analysis is possible only if it excludes uncertainty and change, and economic policy is possible only in contemplation of uncertainty and change. In any event, oil and banking have come full circle , to the point that today's pressures now appear to be almost the reverse of what they were only recently.",,American Petroleum Institute

Reif(Reif National Fuel Gas Co.),,,,,,API-83-Q001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 17-20 April, Denver, Colorado",1983,"Things have an interesting way of coming home to haunt you, in some cases, more rapidly than other:;. Last week I was a panelist a t an AGA marketing meeting in San Francisco and Dick Nelson from Shell attended that meeting and discussed the producers' point of view with respect to current problems in the gas industry. He did a great job and I am sure he enjoyed the meeting, but nevertheless, he was somewhat like a Christian in Lion's Den. I feel somewhat the same today. However, let me tell you why I may be a little bit different than the average gas distributor.National Fuel is an old natural gas company, reaching way back to the 1870's and 1880's. We pushed the first long transmission lines across the Alleghenies from the Pennsylvania gas fields to western New York in 1888. We developed the first underground storage of gas in Welland, Ontario in 1913 and the Zoar Field in New York in 1914. We have over 4000 producing and storage gas wells in our service area and we have a producing subsidiary headquartered in Houston. We also have a pipeline subsidiary and a storage company providing underground storage for non-affiliates. So we really have a widely diversified gas company in addition to our distribution function.In 1956, I attended the first meeting of AGD in New York, by invitation, I concluded and reported to our officers that in my judgment, AGD was formed to fight the producers and I believed that effort was counter-productive for our industry. National Fuel did not join that organization. Later we were instrumental with Consolidated, Columbia and Nicor, to name a few companies, in forming IJDC. These companies all had production affiliates and we felt our interests coincided with the gas industry as a whole. To continue, we are an old gas company; we do know the facts of life about drilling gas wells; we appreciate and understand' the risks .and the rewards of natural gas production.In 1952, we negotiated for the purchase of gas from Shell in the Sheridan Field in Texas and Tennessee hauled the gas for us. That contract evolved because of a favored nation clause in a Tennessee contract. Shortly there after, we had the Phillips decision with all of its ramifications in 1954 and now we have come full circle . Last week at that AGA meeting, I told the assembled AGA executives and I quote: With the usual dire threats about supply, the industry settled down to digest wellhead regulation. Surprisingly, we discovered that wellhead controls weren't all that bad. The price of gas was held well below oil and coal wasn't really a factor. We quickly gobbled up almost 100% of the new home heating market -- better than 65% of the industrial market and were aggressively competing in the cooking and even air conditioning markets.",,American Petroleum Institute

913,321445,,Variable Deflection Fatigue Of Welded Structural Steel In Sea Water,W.H. Hartt(Florida Atlantic University)|Newman K. Lin(Florida Atlantic University),,,,,,API-84-D001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1984,"Design for fatigue resistance has been judged as critical to the integrity of welded connections of offshore structures. While considerable understanding of this failure process and of how it can best be mitigated has been realized in recent years, much of this information has been based upon data and analyses from constant amplitude or deflection experiments. In actual service, however, the stressing is a random non-stationary process; and questions have been raised regarding distinctions, if any, between constant and variable amplitude (or deflection) results and applicability of linear damage summation techniques. The present paper describes an ongoing research project investigating variable deflection fatigue of welded structural steel connections in sea water. Two spectra, one of narrow band and the other wide band, and three levels of cathodic protection are employed. Results to date are presented along with a perspective of the rationale being employed to evaluate the results, first, with regard to our present understanding of variable amplitude (deflection) fatigue and, second, as these pertain to design of welded connections for marine service.IntroductionFatigue has been judged to be of major importance with regard to integrity of offshore structures (1-3). This failure mode may be particularly critical at welded tubular connections, where both macro- and micro-geometrical irregularities contribute to a concentration of stress. Figure 1 illustrates this schematically for the case of a Y connection. Present design procedure for fixed offshore structures of the jacket type typically employs the following sequential steps (4) :Definition of the long-term wave climate based upon the best available information.Global analysis of the structure to determine its response to (1). In the case of deep water structures (period greater than three seconds) dynamic amplification effects are included.Evaluation of local stresses at tubular connections in terms of sea state.Assemblage of stresses to develop a long-term distribution.Calculation of the cumulative damage, D, based upon (4) and the appropriate design S-N curve, according to the expression(Formula is available in full paper) where niis the number of stress cycles corresponding to a discrete sea state and Niis the number of cycles for the corresponding stress range of the design curve .Typically, D should not exceed unity; and the design fatigue life of each joint is often required to be twice the intended service life of the structure.An important assumption upon which accuracy of this design technique depends is that the S-N curve adequately reflect the fatigue response of a particular connection in question. Past research activities sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute have produced fatigue data (5-7) which have enhanced confidence in the high cycle regime of the S-N curve, and these are referenced in the design commentary (4). Historically, these curves have been based upon data from constant amplitude or deflection fatigue experiments; however, it is not known how accurately these represent behavior of actual welded connections which experience random stressing in sea water from wind, wave, tidal, duty loadings and, perhaps, dynamic amplification. Similarly, this design procedure can be no more correct than the linear damage summation technique which is generally employed in the analysis",,American Petroleum Institute

I want to update you on key environmental issues that pose considerable cost impact to our industry. These issues cover the spectrum of air, water and waste, and are addressed within the API Production Department by the Committee on Environmental Conservation (or CEC) which I chair. This morning, I will concentrate on five specific areas of current concern--offshore and coastal discharges, groundwater protection regulations, waste regulations, electrical equipment rules, and air emission rules.First, offshore and coastal discharges. Perhaps the single most important issue we face this year is the statutory mandate for EPA to institute New Source Performance Standards (or NSPS) requirements in its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (or NPDES) discharge criterion by July 1, 1984, utilizing Best Available Technology (or BAT).EPA's statutory authority to regulate discharges, issue general permits, as well as dredge and fill permits, emanates from the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Act requires the agency to implement Best Available Technology requirements in their permits commencing July 1, 1984. The general permits in the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf Coast Area, Offshore Southern California and in Alaska are those which cover the bulk of our activities where discharges are to waters of the U.S.The CEC Subcommittee on General Permit Coordination has opened dialogue with Region 6 and EPA Washington, presenting hard data and detailed comments addressing the issues of a (1) ban on diesel (even for stuck-pipe situations), (2) a reduction in oil and grease limitations from 72 ppm to 59 ppm, and (3) subsurface injection of produced water from gas platforms in all areas and all platforms in the Territorial Seas. A recent report for the Offshore Operators Committee by Walk, Haydel and Associates indicates that the investment cost in the Gulf of Mexico to achieve 59 mg/l on the OCS area and subsurface injection of produced water in the Territorial Seas would be $1.2 billion. Annual operating costs by the year 2000 are estimated to be $299-million.Translating these requirements to the coastal subcategory would require additional capital costs of $3.05 billion and annual operating costs of $829 million. This study was done only for the Gulf of Mexico. The costs of compliance for California and Alaska are additive as well as the full range of economic impacts that these restrictions would cause.Increased operating and capital costs dictate earlier abandonment of marginal wells, leading to significant losses of otherwise recoverable oil. We are hopeful that our ongoing talks with the agency at this time will be productive and that the industry performance record in these areas coupled with research to date will minimize these onerous impacts.The second area of concern deals with groundwater protection regulationsEPA is attempting to formulate a groundwater strategy in a manner which will be consistent across the states. EPA believes that surface impoundments which do not necessarily harbor hazardous wastes pose a significant threat to the nation's groundwater resources. A recent study called SIA - Surface Impoundment Assessment identified our industry as custodian of the largest number of such impoundments.",,American Petroleum Institute

Prud'homme(Princeton University)|Alice Chu(Princeton University),,,,,,API-84-G001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 1-4 April, New Orleans, Louisiana",1984,"I. INTRODUCTIONGuar gels crosslinked with transition-metal ions are used as fracturing fluids in oil well completion. Gels are attractive because cross linking creates a fluid with sufficient viscosity to suspend solid propants while requiring only small amounts of par polymer. To simulate the fracturing operation and predict fracture geometry it is necessary to understand and model the rheology of guar gels. To date , the reproducibility of laboratory tests of guar gel rheology has been poor and models of gel rheology have involved only empirical modifications of the power-law fluid model. These empirical models are incapable of describing the effects of shear and time history on gel properties.The purpose of this paper is t o provide a working guide to the rheology, and characterization of guar gels . First , in Section II, we describe the experimental techniques used t o study guar rheology, which include dynamic oscillatory shear measurements and steady shear measurements. Dynamic oscillatory shear measurements are especially important in investigating gel structure because these measurements can be used to determine the number of network cross links. These measurements and their interpretation are discussed in detail, since they are probably less familiar to researchers in the oil production research area than are steady shear measurements. In Section III we describe the rheological Instruments used in this study. In Section IV the preparation of guar samples is detailed . The composition of the model guar gel used in this study was specified by the API steering committee. Our observations on the factors controlling gel rheology, including chemical effects , sample preparation effects , and flow history effects are presented in Section V. In Section VI a model that describes the rheology of gelling fluids is described. The model is based on the temporary network theories used to describe the rheology of polymer solutions. To this theory we have incorporated the chemical kinetics of metal ion adsorption onto the guar polymer backbone and subsequent polymer-polymer cross linking. In the final section recommendations for standard test procedures, for rheological instrumentation, and for future research are presented.I I. RHEOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTSA. Dynamic Oscillatory MeasurementsDynamic oscillatory shear experiments which measure the linear viscoelastic response of materials are acknowledged to be the most valuable probes of gel o r network structure. Though steady shear measurements are necessary to duplicate process conditions , the oscillatory measurements give more insight into the properties of the gel than do steady shear measurements. When interpreted using classical network theory, linear viscoelastic measurements can be used to determine the kinetics of gel formation, the crosslink density of a gel , or the shear degradation of gel structure . The gelatin of polyvinyl alcohol and gelatin gels have been studied by a number of researchers ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , and a t Princeton we have used these measurements to study polyacrylanide gels used as permeability control agents in enhanced oil recovery ( 4 , 5 ).",,American Petroleum Institute

As a result of intense industry effort, the Amendments to XCRA provide for the exclusion of special wastes as hazardous wastes until and after proper study by EPA. Within the purview of special wastes are included produced brines and drilling fluids. The Act mandates EPA to study these wastes and report to Congress as to the necessity to continue their exclusion status.Based on contact with EPA's Office of Solid Waste, EPA has not yet completed its study of produced brine and drilling fluids. As a first step, EPA has contracted for: (1) a review of state regulations pertaining to these wastes and (2) a literature search relative to research available on these wastes.API continues to share with EPA research efforts relative to industry findings as to the fate and effects of produced waters and drilling fluids. As you know, these discharges are addressed at great length in the voluminous EPA comments and hearing records relative to the establishment of general permits in the offshore areas.Additionally, API has and continues to study the impact of drilling mud pits at onshore locations. Presently, API is planning a fresh water drilling mud pit study where the contents of a new site will be monitored from before the site is built, through the drilling phase and for some time after the pit is closed. A 1ocation.in the Gulf Coast Area will be selected and pre-drilling monitoring wells drilled. Data relative to seasonal ground water movement will be collected prior to construction of the pit.During the life of the pit, an accurate inventory of the discharges to the pit will be maintained. The pit will be constructed using a natural clay bottom. Following drilling, a decision to close will be made based on the inventory and monitor well data. Monitoring will continue for up to eighteen months following closure. This pilot site will provide information necessary to continue the pit study in other soil and climate areas of the United States.The information from this study will allow for a Best Management Plan for the pit constituents and ultimate closure of fresh water drilling fluid pits. Further, it should provide ample data relative to the fate and effects of various mud systems and additives on groundwater.You should be aware of the movement in the regulatory and legislative arenas to control these wastes. Either industry provides the basic research 1ead.ing to the best management of these wastes, or we will be regulated without full knowledge of their environmental impact. EPA has had sufficient emotional stimulation over the past five years to cause closer scrutiny of our operations relative to waste, disposal. Unfortunately, there isnotan abundance of research in the area of fate and effects of impounded oilfield wastes. Consequently, the need for a more extensive study by API is obvious.",,American Petroleum Institute

Crump(Shell Oil Company),,,,,,API-85-B001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"All over America, companies are asking, How can we run faster? ... cheaper? ... better? How can we operate smarter? The answers vary, but in many cases companies are turning to computer technology.That's where the auto industry turned in the face of stiff overseas competition. Complex robot systems have helped improve the quantity and quality of Detroit's assembly line products. The retail industry turned to computers too, and now cashiers ring up sales more accurately with laser scanners that provide instant inventory updates.The petroleum industry is also turning to computers. A movement is underway to use them to monitor and control equipment, and to transfer information to main-frame computers. That can mean improved use of time and money, and, in some cases, a safer place to work. With today's economic climate and regulatory pressures, these benefits are too valuable to overlook.APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED OPERATIONSAt Shell, we call the general use of computers in the field Computer Assisted Operations, or CAO. Typically, computers are used to monitor such oil field facilities as producing wells and injectors, field separators, dehydration units, pumps, compressors, chemical feed systems, storage tanks, pipelines, gas plants, and steam generators.The computer systems come in a variety of packages, as Figure 1 shows. The typical Shell CAO system uses local host computers linked to electronic remote terminal units (RTUs) that are wired to individual pieces of equipment.For example, Shell's oldest CAO systems were installed in Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and East Bay in the early '70s. They use minicomputers to monitor production and lift gas systems, report alarms, and status changes. They also automatically test wells and print routine reports. The Atchafalaya system also meters gas flow in the Crawfish Pipeline from Morgan City to a Shell refinery outside New Orleans. Besides substantially increasing well testing frequency in the Atchafalaya Basin, the systems are especially valuable in these marshy areas where routine travel is difficult and expensive.During severe winter weather, travel also can be a problem in Northern Michigan. Up there, a Shell Oil Company subsidiary, Shell Western ECP Inc. (SWEPI), operates more than 400 wells from Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. In 1984, three CAO systems based on minicomputers were installed there. In addition to providing the basic services found in Louisiana, the Michigan systems also monitor tank levels and calculate daily oil and gas fluctuations for 37 central production facilities. Operators use this information as a daily audit tool for their production facilities. The logged data are also available for routine reports to state agencies.FIGURE 1. SOME OF THE OPTIONS FOR COMPUTER ASSISTED OPERATIONS OR CAO (Available in full paper)Several systems also operate in California's hot, dusty San Joaquin Valley. One was installed in 1980 by another Shell Oil subsidiary, Shell California Production Inc. (SCPI), for a waterflood pilot in the Belridge field. The system monitors the water treatment plant, the pilot injection system and producing wells, and provides critical alarms and reports. At one time it also monitored a steam injection pilot.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lawrence(American Gas Association Arlington),,,,,,API-85-C001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"The title I was assigned for this presentation is When Will The Gas Bubble Break. Accordingly, I want first to answer that question, and then go on to give you our views on the natural gas supply/demand situation and the many areas of mutual, indeed vital, interest that API and A.G.A. share.A.G.A. has forecast that the excess short-term production capability ( gas bubble ) will last at least another two years and possibly for the rest of the decade. Our view is reinforced by the change in Canadian Government pricing policy for gas exports -- a policy that is making more gas available to U. S. energy consumers at price-s that the marketplace will accept.We estimate that thedomesticgas bubble will be about 2.9 Tcf in 1985, up slightly from 1984 and down from 3.9 Tcf in 1983. After the continuing surplus has ended, we expect that gas supply and demand will bein balance.That is,there will not be a gas shortage-- but rather there will be increased incentive for a dynamic new growing supply to serve a growing demand, and there will not be the upward pressure on wellhead prices that some analysts have forecast.When examining short-term natural gas availability, it should be borne in mind that we currently have about 21 Tcf/year of gas available to U. S. markets. This includes a significant quantity of unused Canadian gas that is currently under contract but not being taken. This level of gas deliverability will not be dissipated quickly by rising demand or by the current slowdown in gas well completions. Indeed, despite all anecdotal evidence to the contrary, the figure available to us indicates that U. S. peak gas deliverability remained nearly constant between 1981-1984 -- even though gas well completions declined during this period. It should be noted that gas well completions turned around during the second half of 1984.Our assessment of lower-48 states gas supply stability also is supported by the fact that replacement of production with new reserve additions has far exceeded the expectations of just a few years ago. In the period 1980-1983, aggregate reserve additions in the lower-48 states were 96% of production, 1983 being the third consecutive year when additions nearly equaled orexceededproduction.In 1979, A.G.A. conducted a survey of producers, pipelines and government agencies to assess the outlook for lower-48 states gas production and reserve additions. Overall, seven producers and five pipeline estimates were accumulated and these companies in aggregate forecast 11.8 Tcf/year of lower-48 states reserve additions between 1980-1985. However, between 1980 and 1983, lower-48 states reserve additions in fact average 16.8 Tcf.In summary, the U. S. is currently in its seventh year of what was predicted to be only an 18-month delivery surplus.",,American Petroleum Institute
921,321451,,The Productivity Management Process,John G. Belcher(American Productivity Center),,,,,,API-85-E001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"Before we can talk about managing productivity, we ought to properly define it. The generic definition of productivity is output divided by input -- it is the relationship between an organization's outputs and the inputs utilized to produce those outputs. Improving productivity simply means getting more out of what you put in. Now, while t h a t is a nice straightforward definition , it is inadequate for most organizations. It does not address the quality issue, for example, and it is of little meaning to an organization whose outputs are intangible, such as an engineering department. One of the first tasks of a productivity manager, therefore, is to develop a definition t h a t is meaningful to the organization.Too often managers perceive that productivity applies only to the labor input and sometimes, even more narrowly, only to the hourly worker. In fact, productivity applies t o all of the inputs that are utilized in the productive process. The productivity of capital, materials, or energy may have even greater impact on the bottom line than does the productivity of labor.If we look at the trend of labor productivity growth in this country, we note that the U. S. achieved a regular average annual growth rate in labor productivity of 3.2 percent per year for about 20 years after the close of World War 11. Beginning in the mid-sixties, however, that growth rate began to decline. From 1965 to 1973 the annual growth rate averaged less than 2-112 percent, and from 1973 to 1979, less than one percent. It bottomed out in 1979 and 1980, when outright declines in labor productivity occurred. This was the first time in recent history that the U. S. had experienced a consecutive two-year decline in labor productivity. While growth rates have accelerated again in the early 1980's, for the most part they have not returned to the r a t e s achieved in the early post-war period. In fact , another decline occurred in the third quarter of 1984.When we examine the growth rates of other developed nations, we see that the U. S. has been dead last in labor productivity growth from the mid-sixties to the present, averaging only about one percent per year. Not surprisingly, the Japanese have led in productivity growth during this period, averaging a 5.5 percent increase per year. Even countries that have had well-publicized economic problems, such as the United Kingdom and Italy , have increased their productivity at a more rapid rate than has the United States.When we look a t absolute l e v e l s of labor productivity, however, we see t h a t the United S t a t e s is still number one, with West Germany, France, and Canada close behind. The Japanese economy is only about 75 percent as productive as is the U. S., although in manufacturing, the Japanese are almost even.",,American Petroleum Institute

Tappmeyer(Reading and Bates Drilling Co.),,,,,,API-85-F001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"The most obvious immediate economic challenge for the drilling contractor is to survive the overbuilt status of the industry. Only time, additional activity, and some hardware retirements will take care of this.The challenges we need to look at are any steps or actions we can take to survive and come out of this difficult period in an economically viable condition. If we do not emerge from this period in a viable economic condition, not only we but our clients will suffer while the drilling industry rebuilds its capabilities.Being a drilling contractor and probably somewhat biased, I feel our clients understand it is a great time to get low cost drilling work done, which it is, but have little real concern for the ultimate and not too distant effect on them, which is the quality of service they willnotget from a drilling industry in economic shambles.For this reason, I believe it is important for both we, as drilling contractors, and the operating companies who use our services to explore possibilities for keeping the drilling industry alive, if not totally well, until a better balance of rig supply and demand gives us some help.At current prices, our ability to provide the hardware and quality our clients have come to expect cannot last. Our present efforts to continue that quality are based on an expected--no--rather a hoped for significant improvement in the profitability of our business in the immediate future. If this doesn't happen--we as contractors, even the strong ones, begin disappearing and the service you receive will degenerate to a level you may find hard to accept.To illustrate this point, Table I, Industry Financial Review, shows the published financial results for a cross section of our industry during the last 12 months and latest quarter. Without some improved profits, there really isn't any question where this industry is going--right down the tube.The simple, direct way for the contractor to regain his health is to receive day rates commensurate with the service provided, assuring sufficient profitability to retain top people and attract the capital required to meet our clients' technical hardware needs. I will give some long odds our clients are not going to be so generous any sooner than they have to. On this presumption, let's take a look at how we got in this condition, and then how we might improve the situation during this period of excess equipment supply and still achieve for our client the best results for the least cost.Table I - Industry Financial Review (Available in full paper)As a result of our listening to what we wanted to hear about the limitless requirements for our services, some misguided optimism, and resulting poor judgments, we now have our clients in the position of having a high quality service available at very low cost--a quality developed significantly during the higher day rate period.",,American Petroleum Institute

In Baker's own case, the greatest impact occurred in our tool jointing facility where revenues dropped by 95% within 270 days and for the past 30 months have remained at about 10% of their previous high. The least impacted units were those heavily involved in maintenance and workover.Thus, publicly traded companies have been hit with different amounts of revenue retreat depending upon the mix of their products, services, and market geographics. Using a sampling of published data from segment information of annual reports, the least impacted in revenue fall was Schlumberger at 16%; next was Halliburton at 29%, followed by Hughes Tool Company at 34%, Baker International at 35%, Dresser Industries at 36%, Smith International at 41%, and NL Industries at 48%. These percentages are from that company's all time high reported sales regardless of which year the high water mark occurred. Again, referring to our own data, the pricing structure generally broke between sales fall backs of 25 and 35% and that price break has ultimately averaged a rollback of about 25 to 50% of the 1981 price levels.Against this backdrop, companies in the manufacturing, service, and supply sector are mandated to look toward their economic survival but even more important, every company and/or every product group must earn within the customer community a feeling that that company or that product and service has a right to survive now that the cold light of dawn has revealed that oil is not going to be $100 a barrel and gas is not going to be $15 per mcf. There are some products and services which sprang up during the heyday that will die because they are not perceived by the oil and gas community to be in a proper cost benefit relationship.Turning to what Baker has done to meet our economic challenges, we have targeted the opening paragraph from the management primer on down markets. Be the lowest cost producer of a product and service your customer wants to buy while simultaneously aiming for the highest quality product, the highest quality service people, and the best deliverability out of inventory. Although it's easy to articulate this simple platitude, it's very difficult to achieve it in practice and the level of achievement will vary from profit center to profit center.Of the items receiving intense scrutiny in our Company at the moment, the most dominant is an attempt to accurately assess where, when, and how much of the products and services will be needed by our customers, with a confirmation of this assessment coming from an understanding of where the cash flow will come from to support those customer activity levels.",,American Petroleum Institute

A.),,,,,,API-85-I001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"INTRODUCTIONI appreciate this opportunity to discuss the operating challenge that I personally believe to be a fundamental upon which any good operation is built -- Operating Safety.In my discussion this afternoon, I plan to forego the tendency to build a safety discussion around statistics -- frequencies, ratios, indices -- and focus instead on (1) the broader issues and ( 2 ) what I believe our industry can do to improve performance in this very basic area.SLIDE 1For perspective, let me start with the bottom line. The petroleum industry's safety record is good. Although we haven't reached our objective of being accident-free, we are doing a pretty good job -- surveys consistently show that the petroleum industry is one of the safest. National Safety Council data shows our industry's incidence rates to be considerably better than the average of all principal industries, ranking generally well within the top ten.Next, progress is being made -- we are improving -- as we must. For example, our own API reports show that the total incidence rates for Exploration and Production, as well as for Drilling, have dropped significantly over the last few years. I should point out, however, that based on recent IADC statistics, we may have seen a reversal of this downward trend in inland drilling. Our progress is being recognized -- the Coast Guard, in testimony before a House Committee on June 16, 1983, acknowledged that the rates of both injuries and deaths in offshore drilling have declined significantly since 1979; and the Minerals Management Service reported in 1983 that the overall industry safety record is rapidly improving.Nevertheless, all of us involved in operations know that safety requires -- and merits -- constant attention. We have found, with few exceptions, that retention time for safety-related matters is relatively short and that, absent an experience -- an accident -- we have to be constantly reminded of safety considerations.And finally, teamwork and cooperation are imperative. Operators, contractors, consultants, labor, management, regulatory agencies, and industry groups such as API, must all work together in a spirit of cooperation if we are to collectively get the most out of our efforts to improve operating safety.Let's concede -- up front -- that a good safety initiative is expensive and time-consuming, it diverts effort from other activities, and can, in fact, become a nuisance. So perhaps before going any further, we should ask ourselves -- why emphasize safety?SLIDE 2Although there are many good reasons for promoting safety, I think we will agree that there are three primary areas of concern which can be enhanced through the assurance of safe operations.First, there are what I have termed humanitarian concerns -- concerns for the physical well-being of our fellow man.",,American Petroleum Institute

S. A., and as an equipment manufacturer in my position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cameron Iron Works, Inc., for the past seven years. I also served as an active director of the API for ten years, and was then made a Lifetime Honorary Director upon my retirement, and, as such, continue to attend board meetings.Because of this rare background, I was urged by your organization, as well as some of my manufacturing friends, to accept the assignment to develop a I' manufacturers' viewpoint of API's Quality Program. Since the objectives of the program are so obviously worthwhile for both segments of this great industry, I succumbed to flattery and accepted. I will address my comments specifically to the SPEC 6A document that will be voted on in a few weeks, but many of the points will equally apply to the entire rewrite effort.My first step was to have a series of meetings with Cameron people who were acquainted with the background as well as the details of the proposed SPEC 6A. Following that, a small team called upon executive and technical people from six of the largest SPEC 6A wellhead equipment suppliers. This was to ensure a common understanding by manufacturers of the proposed standard, and that I could report to you regarding these manufacturers' views with some confidence.I have been very interested in Tom Sawyer's review of the past activity of the API Production Department and the developments in more recent years that have stimulated this quality effort; i. e., deeper drilling, production of more corrosive and dangerous gases and fluids, extension of drilling into more hostile environments (such as offshore and the arctic), as well as increased government regulations in some quarters.Other developments that came about during this period included an expansion in research and development by both the manufacturers and the producing oil companies. In our own case, we brought into the market the more exotic metals of the aerospace industry, as well as new elastomers and equipment designs. Needless to say, our competitors also made their contributions. Some of the oil companies created new technical groups to attack equipment problems, and in several instances they set new specifications for their own companies, some of which were then adopted by other companies. Entering the picture, also, were third parties offering inspection services as well as quality assurance specifications. On the manufacturing side, the number of wellhead competitors we can identify increased from 15 in 1979 to over 47 today.",,American Petroleum Institute

It is a pleasure and a privilege to provide the overview for the annual meeting of the API Production Department.In considering the theme of this meeting, Challenges in a Decade of Uncertainties, it occurred to me there is no uncertainty so great as that of a speaker who is -not first on the agenda. I owe thanks to Bobby Hall, Tut Ellis, and the program committee for giving me the first shot on this occasion. At least I know I shan't be left speechless. If I touch on the subjects of the 20 other speakers who will be addressing us over the next two days, let me apologize in-advance -- and say that if I do trespass in their areas of expertise, it will be only briefly.What I intend to do is provide some perspective for the specific problems that will be discussed later. I'd like to begin by stepping back from the here and now and reviewing the wide sweep of changes that have affected our industry over the past 20 years. From this perspective, our current difficulties, which loom so large from close up, may take on more manageable proportions.One of the most significant events of the past two decades was the emergence of the environmental movement, which became a major force in American politics and -- through the political process and the courts -- a strong influence on industry as well. For many years, it seemed that the goals of the movement and the objectives of our industry were in direct and irreconcilable conflict. This led to frustrating and costly delays in exploration and development, particularly in the new frontiers offshore and in Alaska.But we have learned to live with environmental regulations and, in many cases, we take pride in going beyond the letter of the law.Environmental challenges will probably always be with us, but there is no doubt in my mind that today we are better-equipped to respond to those challenges than at any other time in the past 20 years. One reason for this is the expertise -- you might even call it sophistication -- we have developed in dealing with the environment and with the agencies that have environmental responsibilities. That ability has carried over to our relations with many of the organizations that spearheaded the environmental movement. We still don't see eye-to-eye with those groups on many things, of course, but at least we have substituted rational dialogue for the brick bats that were hurled regularly from both sides of the fence in the past.A second landmark event of recent history was the rise of OPEC, the growth of national oil companies and, to a large extent, the dispossession of the private oil companies in many major oil-producing countries. During this period, the international oil companies largely lost control of production to the governments. As a result, oil production in these countries became subject to national economic priorities; it also became a political and diplomatic tool.",,American Petroleum Institute

Swearingen(Continental Illinois Corporation),,,,,,API-85-L001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.It is a special pleasure to be back in Dallas and to have an opportunity to talk to a group of petroleum engineers. I have chosen as my subject this afternoon the somewhat ambiguous yet all embracing title of Changing Times . This is altogether intentional since I want to talk today, not only about changes taking place in the oil and gas business, but about changes that are taking place in business generally in our country and in the world.I think it is human-nature to measure current activities against the background of one's own experiences. I can recall as a youngster thinking that Summer was forever and that the vacation days between school terms were almost without limit. At 6 years of age, I suppose 3 months was indeed a long time. At my present age of 66, however, I think about Summer as 13 weekends that pass almost as quickly as one can tear pages from the calendar.As a child I can recall penny candy, and 5&cent; for a candy bar seemed a small fortune. Today that same candy bar costs 40&cent; and inflation has taken its toll in the price of everything we buy.When I came into the oil business 45 years ago, the price of oil was about % 1.00 a barrel and the United States was producing about 3.7 million barrels a day. Natural gas sales were about 15% of current volumes, and much gas was being sold in the field at 7-10&cent; per 1,000 cubic feet -- hardly enough to pay the cost of gathering, processing and compressing for market. In many areas gas had no market at any price.During the 70's, we saw massive increases in the price of oil and gas to levels of % 35 a barrel for oil and in some instances % 8 per 1,000 cubic feet for gas. Demand seemed insatiable and worldwide concerns were primarily about whether supplies were sufficient to meet demands through the end of the century. It was widely believed that the price of oil would continue to rise steadily and reach % 80-% 100 per barrel by the year 2000.These events, and the expectations they generated, caused a boom in the oil business that none of us had ever experienced before. New drilling rigs were built as quickly as they could be put in place. What had previously been marginal oil and gas prospects quickly became major development opportunities. Manpower demands became insatiable whether for geologists, engineers, geophysicists, drillers or oil field operators. Refineries were modernized, enlarged and even built from the ground up. New pipelines both for oil and gas crisscrossed the nation.",,American Petroleum Institute

Hair(National Wildlife Federation),,,,,,API-85-M001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"Thank you for this opportunity to present the environmental viewpoint of the oil and gas industry. But I must warn you: I hope to shatter forever your stereotype of environmentalists in the same manner that we at the National Wildlife Federation are attempting to shake up the environmental movement's view of the business community.If there is one major message -- one penetrating question -- that I want to leave with you today. . . that I want to travel far beyond this room it is: Why do environmentalists and business people keep repeating the mistakes of past decades? Why do we insist on being adversaries, fighting the same battles over and over again? Aren't we bone weary of drawing battlelines whentogetherwe could chart an effective and positive strategy for both economic development and environmental protection?Unfortunately, an event just two weeks ago proved again that the answer is no . That's when Interior Secretary Hodel announced his five-year program for the Outer Continental Shelf. And, as predictable as the sunrise, industry dashed to its corner, shouting resource lock-up. And what did the environmental community do? What else? Some of my most vocal colleagues screamed They're going to rape our resources as they ran for the opposite corner. Who won with that kind of rhetoric? Absolutely no one !Why should the environmental and business communities always approach issues from such predictable and adversarial positions? How can we -- working together -- break the stereotypes that bind us to outdated thinking and outrageous fears? How can we in the environmental community and you in the oil and gas industry move beyond a discussion of motives to a consideration of merits?I challenge you to initiate the change -- here and now -- first by erasing the skepticism that makes business people and environmentalists too leary of one another.I'm reminded of a story President Kennedy used to tell.Shortly after his election, Kennedy had some run-ins with the steel industry about prices. As a result, he earned a reputation for being anti-business. To counter this perception, Kennedy invited industrial leaders to the White House -- where he spoke enthusiastically about his administration's work on behalf of industry. As he ticked off his accomplishments, he became more and more excited. Finally, he got a little carried away and declared, Why, if I weren't President, I'd invest in the stock market right now. In fact, your opportunity is here now as the Federal government opens thousands of new acres to offshore energy development and as onshore exploration becomes more widespread. We urge that corporate and governmental decisions regarding oil and gas development be based on solid scientific and economic information. Such information should clearly lay out the benefits of development and the inherent environmental risks..There is no such thing as a risk-free society. But we must have enough thorough and objective data to assess those risks and weigh them against economic realities and national needs.",,American Petroleum Institute

Akins,,,,,,API-85-N001,"Annual Meeting Papers, Division of Production, 31 March-3 April, Dallas, Texas",1985,"For its first ten years, OPEC was ignored by all but its own members and even by many of them. The consumers and their oil companies were dominant; no changes could be conceived. This comfortable state ended with the Mideast war of 1967. Although no immediate move was made by OPEC, it began to flex its muscles in the early 1970s. The industrialized countries began to grasp the fact that an organization of oil exporters existed. OPEC was taken very seriously after the overwhelming American assistance to Israel in the Mideast war of 1973, the inevitable oil embargo, and the consequent skyrocketing of oil prices. Immediately after the initial shock, the incredible nature of OPEC struck our economists who predicted its imminent demise.A well-known economist, Milton Friedman, who subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Economics, said in 1974 that OPEC could not possibly sustain a price of $10 a barrel. At that price, he said, so much additional production would come on-stream that the world would be awash in oil ; the United States would again become a major exporter. This gives sterling proof (if any were needed) that economics ( at least oil economics) is not a science but an art, and an arcane one at that.There were some disruptions in the world economy as the price of oil went up much too rapidly in 1973 and early 1974. Whether it went too far is another matter. Apparently it did not; consumption was barely affected by the price increases; in fact it continued to rise through the remainder of the '70s. Then the world was faced with the second great oil shock of 1979-80 which . sprang from western concerns over the Iranian Revolution and the Iraq-Iran war. The price of oil trebled again. Again, the rise was much too fast. There were severe repercussions in the industrialized world and in the Third World. This time, consumption was affected.The price increases of 1979-80 resulted from a frantic bidding by the industrialized countries for the available oil . This should not have happened. Had there been consumer discipline, some rationing and some modest draw-down of stocks, the crisis could have been avoided. Instead, the main industrialized countries built up their stocks thereby exacerbating rather than alleviating the relatively small disruption in oil production. But there are limits as to how far stocks will be built up; when every storage tank and every surplus tanker is full , the realization dawns on consumers that the feared crisis has not materialized and that there will probably be no further cuts in exports. Consumers then start to draw down their stocks. They did this in 1981 and 1982 and put considerable pressure on OPEC to reduce its prices or to restrain production.",,American Petroleum Institute

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory),,,,,,ARMA-01-0003,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,": This paper presents the results of laboratory measurements on the mechanical and acoustic properties of weakly cemented granular rock. Artificial rock samples were fabricated by cementing sand and glass beads with sodium silicate binder. During uniaxial compression tests, the rock samples showed stress strain behavior which was more similar to that of soils than competent rocks, exhibiting large permanent deformations with frictional slip. The mechanical behavior of the samples approached that of competent rocks as the amount of binder was increased. For very weak samples, acoustic waves propagating in these rocks showed very low velocities of less than 1000 m/sec for compressional waves. A borehole made within this weakly cemented rock exhibited a unique mode of failure that is called &quot;anti-KI mode fracture&quot; in this paper. The effect of cementation, grain type, and boundary conditions on this mode of failure was also examined experimentally.INTRODUCTIONRocks with weak intergranular cementation are often encountered during drilling and excavation in poorly consolidated, young, geological formations. Because the strength of such materials is low, they can be a potential threat to the stability of boreholes and other stress-bearing rock structures. They are, however, difficult to characterize because their mechanical behavior is intermediate between that of rock and soil.One of the fundamental differences between granular rock (sandstone) and soil (sand) is the strength of intergranular cohesion. Due to the lack of cohesion, sand under differential stress exhibits significant permanent deformation due to intergranular slip and rotation. A number of theories have been developed to predict the nonlinear, hysteretic stress-strain behavior of sands from only the grain packing geometry and frictional properties between grains (e.g., Mehrabadi et al., 1992; Nemat-Nasser Balendron, 1992). In contrast, competent sandstone (such as Berea) shows permanent deformation that is only a small fraction of total deformation during differential stress loading. Most deformation is attributed to the non-linear elastic deformation of grains and grain contacts that is essentially stress-path independent (Nihei et al., 2000). Intergranular cohesion allows the transmission of macroscopic tensile stress in the medium that can lead to the formation of tensile fractures. Weakly cemented granular rocks are expected to show intermediate behavior between sand and competent sandstone, exhibiting strongly hysteretic stress-strain behavior and the ability to sustain intergranular extensile fractures.The objective of this study is to understand the effect of the micromechanical properties of weak granular rock such as intergranular cohesive strength and porosity on macroscopic properties including load-displacement response, ultimate strength, acoustic wave velocities, and failure made. To this end, we conducted laboratory experiments upon synthetic samples of weakly cemented sandstone with a range of micromechanical properties. The synthetic rock samples were fabricated of pure silica sand with smooth, elongated grain geometry. The grains were cemented by sodium silicate. A series of laboratory load-displacement tests and acoustic wave propagation tests were performed both on core samples and rectangular bricks containing a single simulated borehole. The primary micromechanical parameter used for a series of experiments was the strength of intergranular cohesion. Porosity of the samples was also varied but its range was limited to relatively high values (32-42%). For the brick samples containing a simulated borehole, samples were also made of glass beads (nearly perfectly spherical) to examine the effect of gr",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Thermo-mechanical stresses coupled with the osmotic contributions are used to compute conditions under which the wellbore becomes unstable. Changes in pore pressure due to osmotic effects are a function of the water activity in the mud and the membrane efficiency of the shale. Shale strength alterations with hydration time are considered while determining the critical mud weights. The model presented in this paper is the first complete attempt at including mechanical, chemical and thermal contributions into a general three dimensional wellbore stability model. The results presented from the model clearly indicate the conditions under which all three contributions play an important role in wellbore stability.1 INTRODUCTIONShale instability problems have perplexed the oil and gas industry for many years. Shale drilling problems can be one or more of the following (Bradley, 1979a, b, Hawkes et al. 1998, Lal, 1999): oversized or shrunken hole, hole breakout due to collapse failure, lost circulation due to breakdown failure, stuck pipe, and poor hole cleaning. In addition, excessive volumes of cavings and cuttings, hole fill after tripping, sloughing shale, plastic flow and sand production, well control problems, and borehole breakouts due to low mud density and low mud salinity can also occur during drilling.These problems are primarily caused by the rock stress being larger than the rock strength when a borehole is drilled. This often happens when the in-situ rock is drilled out and replaced by the drilling fluid.Factors causing wellbore stability problems can be classified based on their different effects on shale pore pressure and stress alteration: mechanical, chemical, fluid diffusion, solute diffusion, and thermal diffusion. All the factors may disturb the pore pressure and some of them may disturb the rock total stress field. Therefore the effective stress and failure status may become altered.The discussion of mechanical effects can be found in Bradley (1979a, b), Detoumay Cheng (1988), and Yew Liu (1992). Biot (1941, 1955, and 1962) was the pioneer of poroelasticity studies. Based on his original and extended poroelasticity theory, poroelastic effects are incorporated into wellbore stability analyses (Rice Cleary, 1976, Cheng et al. 1993, Cui et al. 1997).Experimental results have proved the existence of chemical effects on shale pore pressure (Mody Hale, 1993a, O'Brien et al. 1996, Chenevert Pernot, 1998). Even for conditions of original identical wellbore pressure and initial pore pressure, an alteration of pore pressure was clearly observed by Hale Mody (1992) and Hale et al. (1993). Chemical effects, caused by the difference between shale water activity and drilling fluid water activity, can be treated as an equivalent hydraulic potential (Chenevert, 1969,. 1970) in wellbore stability analysis. Chenevert Pemot (1998) have successfully measured the membrane efficiency, which is determined as the ratio of the observed osmotic pressure divided by the theoretical osmotic pressure. The effect of chemical osmosis was integrated into wellbore stress calculations and can be found in Hale et al. (1993), Osisanya Chenevert (1996), and Fonseca Chenevert (2000). Ion movement can also induce pore pressure change inside the formation, as well as water transport across the wellbore.Thermal stresses can be induced by the temperature difference between the drilling fluid and the rock matrix. A pore pressure change can occur consequently due to the imbalance of the volumetric expansion between the solid skeleton and the pore fluid. Kurashig",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Lemoine(Geometrix Consultants)|R. Islam(Dalhousie University),,,,,,ARMA-01-0019,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,": Centrifuge tests were performed to study sand production problem that is a major issue in many oil and gas recovery projects. The tests simulated seepage-induced failure around a multi-perforated vertical well. Two different scenarios were considered: (1) perfs evenly spaced along the casing within a homogeneous sand layer, and (2) ditto but a shaley seam was introduced in the middle of the layer. Data collected during the experiments included time dependent variation of pore pressure within the pay zone, flow rate, sanding rate, and tracking of the enlargement of the cavity around the well. Numerical modeling was used to better interpret and support the experimental results. Overall, the study performed shows that (1) the location of perfs affects the mode and magnitude of sand production and the concomitant productivity, and (2) long-term productivity can be improved through managed sand production. These findings are consistent with some field cases where extraordinary increases in production were noted due to sanding.1 INTRODUCTIONManagement of sand production related problems is complex and is in desperate need of optimization. The conventional approach has been to err on the conservative side by employing any effective measure that prevents or minimizes sanding. Such measures commonly include installation of liners and gravel packs around wellbores right after drilling. Depending on the depth of the reservoir and length of the payzone, the installation cost can be quite high. There are also ongoing maintenance (e.g., workover) issues to contend with as gravel packs and filters become progressively plugged and that lowers the overall productivity (Kenter and Curfie, 1998). The primary design issue in situations where excessive sand production cannot be tolerated is to determine when to install sand control measures as often sanding does not become a problem until late in the life of the reservoir when significant depletion leads to squeezing of the material towards the opening. By deferring the placement of packs and filters, not only a better use of the capital spending is made but also the productivity of the well is not unnecessarily compromised.There are a number of key issues that field operators are concerned with when it comes to sand production. In some fields (e.g., offshore) any sand production is considered too much and every feasible measure must be taken to prevent it. The question in these situations is when should sand exclusion measures be installed. In less sensitive cases where operators are prepared to tolerate some sand production (sand bursts) in order to remove the skin damage, the question is how to make sure that sand production will not get out of control. Then there are cases where operators intend to exploit sanding to boost long term productivity. While this has been exercised with some success, the field performance has not been consistent. In some cases, very little improvement in productivity has been experienced, perhaps because not enough sand was produced or perhaps sanding could not be contained within the pay zone. In other cases, sand production either be came continual or culminated in water production, possibly due to absence or break up of the cap rock. In cases where sanding did successfully yield higher productivity, the principal mechanisms could not be uniquely identified as such the same success could not be repeated.Take the case for the Burnt Lake project (Yeung, 1995). In this case, in a pilot test, sanding resulted in over two orders of magnitude increase in productivity. Based on a relatively fast communication established between an injection and observation well that were over 500 m apart, several possibilities have been specul",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Tan(CSIRO Petroleum),,,,,,ARMA-01-0027,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,":This paper presents an experimental study on the effect of water/oil saturation on sandstone strength. Unconfined compressive strength and triaxial tests were conducted on outcrop and downhole sandstone saturated with oil and water. It is found that, in general, strength reduction is more significant for water saturation than for oil saturation. The degree of strength reduction due to water saturation is related to total clay volume; the greater the clay volume the more significant is the strength reduction. The results indicate that effect of water cut on sand production depends on the clay content of the formation. Significant strength reduction is expected for clay rich sandstones whilst this may be insignificant for clean sandstones.INTRODUCTIONSand production in petroleum industry is a phenomenon of solid particles being produced together with reservoir fluids. Conceptually, this process may be divided into two stages the loss of mechanical integrity of the rocks surrounding an open hole or periforation, and transportation of the failed rock particles to the surface. Prediction for sand production involves comparing the stresses around the opening with the rock strength using a sand production prediction model. It is well known that the effective stresses increase as the reservoir pressure is depleted. Furthermore, increase in water-cut in the reservoir formation during late life of the field is inevitable, be it due to water injection or water coning. On average, the oil companies today produce three barrels of water for each barrel of oil (Bailey et. al. 2000). Increase in water-cut can reduces capillary pressure that exists between the water and hydrocarbon fluid, and rock strength. Although the effect associated with reservoir depletion is, in general, incorporated in sand production prediction, the effect of water-cut on the sandstone strength has rarely been considered. This is due to a lack of understanding on the effect of water/oil saturation on rock strength, particularly for weakly/poorly consolidated sandstones.The effect of water saturation on rock mechanical properties has been a subject of intensive research in the past (e.g. Baud et al. 2000, Colback Wiid 1965, Dyke Dobereriner 1991, Hawkins McConnell 1992). It is well known that water saturation of specimens prior to testing has a strength reduction effective for all types of rock. For example, the influence of moisture content on the strength and deformation of sedimentary rocks was described in detail by Colback Wiid (1965). For shale lithologies and a quartzitic sandstone, they reported a 50% loss in unconfined compressive strength when the rocks were fully saturated with water from their dry state.It has been found that the effect of water on rock strength is highly variable for different types of rock. Dyke Dobereiner (1991) discussed variation of unconfined compressive strength of three sandstones with moisture content. They found that the reduction of unconfined compressive strength from dry to saturated varied from 24 to 34%. They concluded that, in general, the weaker the rock the more sensitive it is to changes in moisture content. Hawkins McConnell (1992) compared the loss in unconfined compresslye strength between dry and saturated specimens for 35 British sandstones. They found that the difference between the unconfined compressive strengths at dry and saturated states was 78% for the clay-rich Greensand while for the siliceous sandstone the strength decreased by only 8%. They concluded that the degree of strength sensitivity to water saturation is primarily controlled by the mineral composition and to a lesser extent by the rock microfabrics.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Starting from the '80s, rock mechanics specialists have attempted to explain, and predict the onset of sanding in a hydrocarbon well. Two common shortcomings in the traditional approaches are: (1) use of MohrCoulomb and similar failure criteria, which do not seem to explain the large, episodic manner of sand production from the reservoir rock; and (2) limited scope of laboratory rock mechanics tests e.g., triaxial tests at low confining pressures. Both aspects address the brittle failure of rock, which does not seem to account for the 'tons' of sand commonly produced fi-om a deep well. We have studied the development of a ductile failure zone around a well under high effective mean stress that leads to pore collapse and growth of a sand bank. This mechanism can explain the production of large amount of sand produced fi'om deep wells. Using the classical Kirsch equations for stresses around a circular hole, and a cap model to calibrate the constitutive behavior of rock, we have demonstrated that pore collapse indeed takes place around a borehole or perforation tunnel, leading to the growth of a sand bank. We have developed a graphical calibration procedure to validate the sanding prediction model. A case history of sand production prediction from a deep gas-condensate sandstone reservoir (Lower Devonian) is presented.INTRODUCTIONThe industry considersand production a problem when the rate of sand production is high, for two reasons: (i) abrasion of pipes and control fittings in the flow system, which may lead to catastrophic situation, e.g., explosion in gas flow line; and (ii) closure of the well due to 'sand-up', i.e., high accumulation of sand particles in the wellbore bottom, causing severe decline in oil/gas production rate.Certain amount of coarse sand particles can be tolerated, especially if the produced liquid is oil. Higher viscosity oil further lessens the blasting effect of sand particles. However, even a small amount of sand particles in a high flow rate gas well may not be tolerable because of the danger of intensive sand blasting effect leading to pipe explosion.In an excellent review of the analytical models for predicting the onset of sanding, Sanfilippo et al. (1995) categorized them into two groups, based on the failure mode of rock: tensile or shear failure. The models belonging to the first group aim to evaluate a critical production rate, or more precisely, a critical pore pressure gradient around perforations, while the other ones deal with a critical effective stress state. Among the first group are the criteria proposed by Weingarten and Perkins (1992), applied also by Ramos et al. (1994). The second group includes the models proposed by Risnes et al. (1981), by Santarelli et al. (1991), and the extension of the latter one by Kessler et al. (1992). The model proposed by Risnes et al. (1981) was later modified by Sanfilippo et al. (1995).Abass et al. (1993) have described the physical processes involved in four differentypes of mechanisms that cause large (grains) and/or small (fines) size solids generation (Fig. 1). These mechanisms are: (i) tensile failure, (ii) cohesional failure, (iii) shear failure, and (iv) pore collapse failure. As shown in Fig. 1, the tensile and/or shear failures create a locali?.ed shear fault/plane or shear bands. Around a wellbore or a perforation, these shear plane/bands are of small extent, implying that the amount of solid particles released from the rock matrix is also small. On the other hand, erosional sand production due to cohesive failure, and pore collapse failure can give rise to high rate of sand producti",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The analysis is based on bifurcation theory, and employs a Cosserat-Mohr-Coulomb flow theory of elastoplasficity with hardening and softening which is calibrated on conventional triaxial compression test data. The 'preference' for shear rs. splitting failure as a function of load conditions, material properties, etc. is addressed. In addition, the paper elaborates on the entirely different macroscopic features as exhibited by shear and splitting failure. The most important results are: (a) splitting failure shows a pronounced scale effect, whereas shear failure does not, and (b) the 'preference' for either splitting or shear cavity failure depends on constitufive properties, cavity size, and internal cavity support. Splitting failure appears to be favoured in stronger, more dilatant rocks and larger cavities, whereas shear failure appears to be favoured in very weak, non-dilatant rocks and/or smaller cavities. Moreover, small internal cavity support appears to favour shear failure, often leading to a significant increase in failure stress. The above results are in line with laboratory observations to date.INTRODUCTIONLoading experiments on cylindrical cavities in a wide variety of sandstones have shown that failure can take place either in 'splitting mode', leading to narrow 'cusp-shaped' breakouts, or it can take place in 'shearing mode' leading to broad 'dog-ear' breakouts (Van den Hoek et al. 1992, 1994a,b, 1996, 2000a; Haimson et aL 1993). In the latter case (shear failure), it is also possible that breakouts do not develop at all, but instead the cavity remains circular in shape, while shear bands are spiralling outwards from the cavity wall. The latter phenomenon has been observed especially in very weak sandstones (e.g. Van den Hoek et al. 2000b).Figure 1 shows a schematic layout of both failure types. In the case of splitting (Fig. la), initial failure is characterised by a &quot;buckling&quot; of the cavity wall, whereas in the case of shear (Fig. lb), initial failure is characterised by curved shear bands. Figure 2 shows experimental examples of cusp-shaped breakouts (Fig. 2a: Castlegate sandstone) and spiralling shear bands (Fig. 2b: weakly consolidated artificial sandstone).The scope of the paper is to analyze theoretically the issue of splitting versus shear failure at the cavity wall. The analysis is based on bifurcation theory, and employs a Cosserat-Mohr-Coulomb flow theory of elastoplasticity with hardening and softening which is calibrated on conventional triaxial compression test data. Previously, this theory was successfully applied to explain sand production behaviour in the field (Van den Hoek et al. 1996, 2000a), and size dependency of hollow cylinder strength observed in the laboratory on a variety of sandstones (Tronvoll et al. 1993, Papamichos and Van den Hoek, 1995).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The experimental resultsuggest that grain bonding in sandstone, as well as porosity, determine the shape of borehole breakouts. Samples of St. Peter sandstone and high porosity Berea sandstone, which have prominent quartz overgrowth grain suturing, develop long, tabular breakouts perpendicular to the maximum far-field horizontal principal stress direction, having virtually constant widths of approximately 5-8 grain diameters. Samples with considerable amounts of iron oxide cementing material, such as the 17% porosity Berea sandstone, develop dog-cared breakouts in the same orientation. Samples of high porosity (n=29%) Tablerock sandstone, which has clay mineral cementing material, develops broad, rounded breakouts that also extend perpendicular to the maximum far-field horizontal principal stress.INTRODUCTIONBreakouts in vertical boreholes result from compressive failure at the borehole wall, and occur at diametrically opposed points where the stress concentration is greatest, i.e. along the least far-field horizontal stress (o?,) springline. Gough Bell (1981) first documented this type of borehole failure in many Alberta, Canada wellbores, and confirmed from four-arm dipmeter logs that breakout orientations are orthogonal to the maximum horizontal principal stress (OH).Laboratory experiments reported by Haimson Herrick (1986), Lee Haimson (1993), and Haimson Song (1993), revealed breakout geometries in crystalline and fine-grained sedimentary rocks identical to those described by Gough Bell. Typically, these breakouts had a dog-cared shape extending from the borehole wall in the direction of the least principal far-field horizontal stress.Similar laboratory breakout experiments done by Haimson Song (1998) described two distinct breakout shapes in Berea sandstone. Samples of Berea sandstone with 17% porosity developed breakouts having the typical dog-cared shape and orientation. However, 22% porosity Berea sandstone samples developed elongated, fracture-like breakouts, which also formed parallel to the least principal far-field horizontal stress. Bessinger et al. (1997) documented such fracture-like breakouts in lightly sintered glass bead bricks subjected to uniaxial stress. These fracture-like openings, counterintuitively oriented perpendicular to the maximum farfield stress direction, suggest that they form by a different mechanism than breakouts studied previously. The goal of the research reported here is to provide some insight into the development of fracturelike breakouts, and the different material properties that determine the shape of borehole breakouts. We report here some initial breakout experiments in St. Peter sandstone and subsequent thin section analyses, and compare the results to previously published breakout studies in Berea and Tablerock sandstones 0talinson Song 1998, Kovacich 2000).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

In addition to failure in intact rock, wellbore instability can also be initiated along natural discontinuities, such as bedding planes and fractures, in rock masses (Last et al. 1995, Okland and Cook 1998). Such instability occurs when the effective stresses acting on the discontinuities reach their critical values which will result in the slippage and rotation of the blocks. In addition, mud infiltrated into the fractures may interact with reactive formations and/or lubricate the fractures which can lead to a reduction in the fracture friction angle. As a result, the rock masses are more prone to wellbore instability along the fractures.Few records of numerical analyses to investigate wellbore behaviour in fractured rock masses can be found in the literature, especially with friction angle reduction of the fractures when they are infiltrated with mud. Zhang et al. (1999) conducted a relatively comprehensive study of wellbore behaviour in fractured rock masses. However, no mud infiltration mechanism, which is believed to be critical in fractured rock masses, is considered in their study. In this paper, coupled numerical analyses are presented to investigate the influence of fractured rock mass, pore pressure and, in particular, mud infiltration into the fractures on wellbore stability under both isotropic and anisotropic stress states. Two regular fracture geometries are considered in the analyses.

The accuracy and reliability of the proposed model is verified by comparing the model prediction with the result of hollow cylinder tests on sandstone. The possibility of using critical effective plastic strain as an indicator for onset of borehole collapse and sand production is discussed.INTRODUCTIONSand production has been considered undesirable outcome from reservoirs, due to either an aggressive production strategy or weakly consolidated sand skeleton. Sand control strategy, effective or not, costs the industrial millions of dollars each year, particularly in off-shore operations and horizontal wells where solid production is strictly prohibited. A strategy to evaluate sanding risks in each producing well is essential to cut the cost on well completion. Accurately predicting the onset and amount of sand production obviously can allow completion engineers to decide if and when a sand control strategy is necessary.Numerical and analytical models have been used to develop quantitative tools, but the utilization of these tools must be verified by validating the models against field or experimental data. Extensive studies have been conducted to understand stress, deformation, and final collapsing process of various rocks. These studies are normally performed through hollow cylinder tests in lab, as well-defined boundary conditions and material behaviors may be obtained. Santarelli et al. (1986) noted that a linear elastic model may overestimate the apparent hoop stress concentration on the wall of sandstone hollow cylinders. Ewy Cook (1990) attempted to verify a hollow cylinder failure through a complete process of deformation and final collapse. Papamichos van den Hoek (1995) emphasized the effect of borehole size on collapse strength of hollow cylinders of sandstones. Because of the nature of simplicity, elastic-perfectly-plastic model has been used to study either the stresses or deformation near a circular hole. A drawback from such a model may rise because the such a model defines a problem which is statically determined: the near-hole stresses can be calculated separately from the strains and displacemenCs (Detournay Fairhurst, 1987). If we wish to develop a simple model based on elasto-perfectly plasticity and determine the final failure or sanding by stress/strength, as we usually do, then we are facing a great challenge: the initial plastic yielding may be too conservative to represent the onset of failure condition, as no hoop stress build up is possible after the initial yielding. Yet no hoop stress increase is permissible after the yielding, which makes final failure prediction by comparing the hoop stress with strength criterion impossible.To determine sand production associated with fluid flow, Bratli Risnes (1981) proposed a criterion for sanding when the effective radial stress is approaching zero. Such a criterion has been extensively adopted for sand production in the field, and there is report to support such a criterion used in gas field (Weigarten Perkins, 1994), but their accuracy and applicability in the field are yet to be defined in a broad sense. Because most existing simplified model is solely developed based on stress distribution, the constitutive relationship may appear irrelevanto the failure and sanding process. Such an approach can lead to serious misleading conclusions and results, as a reliable model should be verified by a physical model and compatible with constitutive relationship (Detoumay, 1986; Ewy Cook, 1990; Veeken et al., 1992).In this paper we proposed a simplified model based on elastoplast",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Company),,,,,,ARMA-01-0077,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,":A highly compacted shale from 12700 feet depth was found to contain a significant quantity of reactive clays. When exposed to freshwater while under stress, the shale pore pressure rose to a value greater than the fluid pressure, indicating the presence of osmotic-?type forces. The pore pressure response was extremely slow, corresponding to a permeability of -10 '22 m 2. Swelling and velocity reduction were also observed. In undrained hydrostatic compression tests, negative pore water pressures were measured, arising from capillary forces. However, other evidence indicates that the unstressed shale core is fully or almost fully saturated. Based on the 'response-time' of this shale, the maximum allowable strain rate for undrained triaxial compression is calculated to be'-5E-08 strain/sec.INTRODUCTIONThe behavior of shales impacts many industries, such as petroleum, mining, civil construction and tunneling. In the petroleum industry, shales represent the majority of the formations that lie above oil and gas reservoirs. Seismic waves must pass through the shales in order to image the reservoir, and wells must be successfully drilled through the shales in order to access the reservoir. Wellbore instability is a common problem in shales, due to their generally low strength and also to chemicomechanical interactions of the clays with drilling fluids.Developing a better understanding of shales will have large payoff, especially in predicting and preventing wellbore instability. Unfortunately, our understanding of shales, especially deep shales, is limited. This is because preserved shale cores are not often obtained, and even less often are the cores stored, handled and tested in a manner that keeps them preserved. Tests performed on shales that have been contacted by any aqueous fluid, for example, are suspect, as are tests performed on shales that have dried out.Even tests performed on fully-preserved samples can result in erroneous conclusions if the tests are not designed carefully. For example, tests in which the shales are not under stress, or in which the shales are only partially saturated, can give misleading results. Also, due to their extremely low permeability, shales must be loaded very slowly if one is to accurately measure the pore pressure within the shale. We recently obtained a preserved shale core from over 12000 feet depth. In spite of its great depth of burial and high degree of compaction, this shale contains a significant amount of mixed-layer illite/smectite, a reactive swelling clay. In addition to characterizing the petrophysical properties of this shale, we have performed both mechanical and chemico-mechanical tests. This paper reports some interesting behaviors that we have observed.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Ion transfer in the mud/shale system is coupled to formation stresses and pore pressure. The field equations are derived within the framework of a Biot-like isotropic poroelastic theory and allow determination of the mechanical response of shales to drilling-induced chemical, stress, and pore pressure disequilibria. These field equations are solved analytically to yield the solute mass fraction, pore pressure, and the stress distributions around a borehole using a generalized plane strain approach. The impact of ion transfer on pore pressure/stress fields around a borehole in shale has been studied by considering a vertical well. It has been determined that ion transfer causes the chemical-osmosis to become time dependent. As time increases, the transfer of ions leads to osmotic pressure dissipation and re-establishment of a pore pressure regime characteristic of hydraulic flow. Furthermore, it has been found that while the wellbore may be supported by a mud pressure of significant magnitude, the rock can experiences a tensile effective radial stress due to the invasion of solute into the formation. The distribution of tangential effective stress is also affected by ion transfer; it is reduced at the borehole wall, however, this reduction is initially overcome by the larger increase resulting from the reduction of pore pressure near the wellbore. The transfer of ions in the mud/shale system has a significant impact on stress and pore pressure distributions around a borehole. Hence, its contribution to borehole failure is significant and should be considered in the process of optimizing the mud properties.INTRODUCTIONOil-based muds can remedy some shale instability problems and enhance hole stability. However, oil-based muds are toxic and poorly biodegradable. Water-based muds may be used a,*, an alternative, but they have shown poor shale. drilling performance (van Oort et al. 1996), became when in contact with a drilling fluid, shale absorbs water into its clay matrix between aggregates, particles, and basal planes of crystals. The sorption of water is accompanied by a change in the interlayer spacings between clay surfaces which causes the rock to swell. In addition to the chemical composition of the drilling fluid, shale swelling and reactivity are influenced by the chemical composition, amount, and distribution of water within the shale itself. The influx of mud filtrate into the formation leads to excessive stress, pore pressure, and ionic exchange between drilling fluids and shale. Therefore, it is a major contributing factor to shale deterioration and instability. Additional causes of borehole instability include thermal stresses and the anisotropy of the formation as well as the in-situ stress state. The chemo-mechanical processes causing shale deterioration and borehole instability while drilling have been studied by a number of investigators (Mody and Hale, 1993; Ghassemi et al. 1998).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Of the sixty-eight samples tested, fourteen degraded into mud, and fifty-four experienced little or no changes. Kaolinite was the main clay mineral in the shales. Shales composed of kaolinite slake as a result of pore-air compression. Pore-air compression is the result of water suction by the pores. Pore-air compression is favored by small pore radii. The samples that slaked had pore diameters equal to or smaller than 0.06 mm. However, many of the samples that did not slake also had pores with diameters smaller than 0.06 mm. Using fractal theory, this study presents an explanation for why the shales with small pore sizes did not slake. The explantion is based on the degree of roughness of the pore walls. It was determined experimentally and theoretically that pore wall roughness had a negative effect on the development of pore-air compression in the shales with porediameters smaller than 0.06 mm.1 INTRODUCTIONShale is the most common group of rock material found in the Earth's crust. Because of their abundance, shales have been used in the construction of earth embankments for highways as well as earth dams for the retention of water. Shales also form part of the roof system in underground coal mines and of natural or engineered slopes. Many types of shales slake when in contact with water. Thus, shale degradation has been associated with many infrastructure problems such as settlement and instability of highway embankments, subsidence in areas with coal mines, and slope instability (Olivier, 1979; Cununings et al., 1983). To date our knowledge of the mechanisms of shale slaking is incomplete (Pappas and Vallejo, 1997). The purpose of this study is to present a microstructural analysis to investigate how pore geometry in shales influence their degradation when in contact with water. The pore geometry will be evaluated using fractal theory (Mamndelbrot, 1977).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

These forces are function of the composition, type, mount, and microfabric of the clay content in the rock, which are responsible for the global shale behavior. Thus, the knowledge of these features is fundamental to explain their swelling behavior. This paper presents the results of water distribution analyses of seven samples of shale from different oil fields along with their X-ray diffraction, in order to establish the differences in both composition and swelling behavior of such samples. The X-ray diffraction analyses show clearly the differences of swelling clay content between shale samples. Thermal gravimetric analyses also validate that a simple analysis of the water loss below 100 &oslash;C gives a good insight about the composition and swelling behavior of shales. It also show that the water loss below 55 &oslash;C, is strongly dependent of the activity; and that this dependence quickly decreases as temperature increases, which suggest that the role of activity in the swelling behavior of shale only takes place at lower temperatures.INTRODUCTIONOil and gas wells represent the fundamental infrastructure in hydrocarbon exploitation. Drilling the wellbore is the first and, usually, the most expensive step in oil and gas production activities. As a consequence, designing a stable and safe well has become a critical issue in petroleum engineering. Wellbore stability, mainly in shales, is one of the important problems encountered during drilling. More than one hundred million dollars are spent worldwide each year in remedial works. In the past, one solution has been to use oil-base muds, which can often eliminate the swelling problem associated with shales; however, environmental concerns increasingly restrict their use, and in many cases water-base muds are now required. The development of improved water-base mud for shale stability is the primary concern in the drilling industry. Wellbore stability has occupied the attention of many researchers this past decade and some discrepancies have been reported, not only in their chemomechanical approach, but also in the understanding of their hydration behavior, and their characterization.Shale are sedimentary rocks that have distinct laminated layered characteristics and high clay content. The chemical processes, responsible for this formation must be understood in terms of two mechanisms: 1) neoformation. actual precipitation from solution; and, 2) transformation. whereby a new clay mineral inherits a significant part of its silicate skeleton from preexisting minerals, usually a phyllosilicate.These processes include chemical weathering in soils, formation of authigenic minerals at the sediments depositional site, formation of diagenetic minerals after deposition, and clay minerals formed by hydrothermal alteration. Shales are, therefore, subjected to phenomena such as hydration, swelling, slu'inking, and strength reduction when exposed to water and ions. The mechanisms controlling these reactions are very complex and are not fully understood. These reactions result from the hydrophilic nature of the clay particles, which are somewhat, altered by both the chemical and mechanical environments. The chemical effects are due to the intermolecular forces between the clay particles and the ionic pore fluid inside the shale, as well as the composition of the drilling fluid. However, it has been recognized that the type and amount of clay groups and subgroups play an important role in distinguishing different hydration behaviors, as a result of their charge deficiency location (silic",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The drilling of a hole into a formation in equilibrium induces stress concentration around the borehole. A physiochemical interaction occurs if parameters like hydraulic and chemical potential of the water-basedrilling fluid (WBM) and shale formation fluid are not in equilibrium. Differences in these parameters influence the borehole stress-state and shale mechanical strength. This work presents the results of a laboratory study conducted to observe changes in pore pressure and acoustic and dynamic mechanical properties of Pierre II shale exposed to WBMs under simulated geo-static stress conditions. The experiments show that shale pore pressure is altered as a function of WBM exposure. These alterations can also be observed with simultaneous measurements of shale acoustic velocities. Results from such tests will aid in the diagnosis of logging-whiledrilling (LWD) wellbore (in)stability problems, which is the long-term objective.INTRODUCTIONShales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks composed of clay, silt and in some cases fine sands. In the hydrocarbon drilling industry and for the purpose of this discussion, shale will be termed as an ill-defined heterogeneous argillaceous material ranging from the relatively weak clay-rich gumbo to highly cemented shaly siltstone, with the common characteristic being of formations with extremely low permeability that contain clay minerals.Shales make up over 75 percent of drilled formations and cause over 90 percent of wellbore instability problems. The drilling of shale can result in a variety of problems ranging from washout to complete collapse of hole. More typically, drilling problems in shales are experienced as bit bailing, sloughing, or creep. (In)stability in shales is a continuing problem that results in substantial annual expenditure by the petroleum industry -half a billion dollars per year according to conservativestimates.A drilling fluid system (drilling mud) consists of different solid and fluid components, with different components added to the fluid to improve performance. Main functions of a drilling fluid include the removal of rock material during drilling, imparting hydraulic support to the borehole to ensure stability, providing lubrication to reduce friction between the borehole surface and drillpipe, cooling the drill bit, etc. In the past, oil-based drilling muds (OBM) have been the system of choice for difficult drilling. Their application has been typically justified on the basis of borehole stability, thermal stability, fluid loss, lubricity, etc. As environmental concerns restrict the use of oil-based muds, the petroleum-service industry must provide innovative means to obtain OBM performance without negatively impacting the environment. Water-based drilling fluids (WBM) are attractive replacements from a direct cost viewpoint. But, conventional WBM systems have failed to meet key performance measures met with OBMs, especially while drilling high-angle, extended-reach well trajectories going through water-sensitive shale formations.Past efforts to develop improved WBM for shale drilling have been hampered by a limited understanding of the drilling fluid/shale interaction phenomenon. This limited understanding has resulted in drilling fluids designed with inadequately optimized properties that are required to preventhe onset of borehole instability problems. Historically, wellbore (in)stability problems have been approached on a trial-and-error basis, going through a costly multiwell learning curve before arriving at reasonable solutions for optimized operations and systems.

The main objectives were to predict pore pressure and fracture gradient, analyze compartmentalization, aid to well design and control drilling in the overpressured sections. We were particularly interested in understanding the role of diagenetic changes and tectonic activities (faulting) that control (enhance/damage) the sealing properties of shales. Faulting is an important mechanism in forming of the overpressured zones, but on the other hand it can partially destroy shale sealing properties. These two different events were observed in the Gulf-of-Mexico area and thoroughly documented. Assessment of both examples allows defining an influence of particular fault and predicting formation pressure with more confidence.INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDThe scope of this paper is to analyze the results of drilling in overpressured zones, plus incorporate previous data and analyses of wells of Matagorda Island and East Cameroon fields and based on that provide recommendations tbr future drilling in the Gulf-of-Mexico area. Our main objective was to assess the influence of various faults on shaly sealing properties and well bore stability. Material for this study was collected over past several years when an effort was made to predict pressure compartmentalization and position of casing points in eight wells drilled.The features we have to account for, while drilling into a overpressured zones are the decrease of shale density, consequent increase of shale porosity and lower associated water salinity in contrast to shales that had been buried under overpressured regime [6,7]. This is important because of the great expense of drilling and complexities in completing wells in a deep zones and prediction of sealing properties in deep formations. The &quot;safe window&quot; for drilling could be determined between the calculated pore and fracture pressures. For the well to be stable and under control, the mud pressure gradient must always be in between. There are several mechanisms of the abnormal formation pressure (AFP) forming which are discussed in literature [3,4,7,8]. This includes: buoyancy; compaction; diagenesis; hydrocarbons generation; osmosis; temperature and tectonic. And also Adam Bourgoyne adds fluid migration across faults or underground blowout [1].Compaction of sediments with increasing depth of burial is believed to be the main source of abnormal pressure [4]. After the initial effect of compaction causing expulsion of interpore water from the shaly rocks, diagenetic changes become more important. During alteration, clay minerals are transformed from low density, highly disordered products of weathering/reworking into dense chlofite [2]. The difference in compaction can typically be observed and quantified using acoustic, neutron, density and resistivity logs.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Recent laboratory compression tests provide compelling evidence that water weakening also occurs in poorly-consolidated, weakly-cemented, detrital, siliciclastic (e.g., quartz and feldspar) rocks as well as chalks. A series of experimental studies was undertaken to identify the mechanism of water weakening in rocks, including many triaxial compression tests and uniaxial strain compression tests with fluid injection. Experimental evidence indicates water weakening requires the presence of chemically active water molecules and intimate chemical contact between liquid water and the rock matrix. One model that appears to be consistent with experimental results is &quot;stress-enhanced solubility&quot; of matrix grains subjected to high grain-to-grain contact stress. Quantitative models indicate this to be a viable water weakening mechanism.INTRODUCTIONThe consequences of water weakening are many, including a huge increase in rock compressibility, loss of strength, and reduction in matrix permeability. Consequences of water weakening for reservoir management include increased reservoir compaction and sea floor subsidence, reduced well bore stability, and increased casing failures. The water weakening of detrital rocks is less dramatic than observed in chalks, but it may easily account for the often observed well bore instability, production of solids, and casing failures that frequently accompany water breakthrough in hydrocarbon production wells. Water weakening also may contribute to poorer hole quality frequently observed in boreholes drilled with water base muds as compared to boreholes drilled with oil base muds.People have observed and studied the weakening effects of water on glass, rocks, and other ceramic materials for many years. Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the water-weakening phenomenon. Suggested mechanisms include reduction in surface free energy and intracrystaHine gliding (Boozer et al. 1962), dissolution and pressure solution (Newman 1983), capillary forces (Brignoli et al. 1994, Papamichos et al. 1996), and bond rupture at crack tips (Parks 1990).

A number of injection mechanisms are possible; and the dominating mechanism depends on the physical properties of the formation as well as other factors. The experimental investigation conducted during the study reported here indicates that rock texture is a key, contributing factor in certain physical rock characteristics including velocity and load bearing strength.INTRODUCTIONRock physics laws relate porosity, mineralogy, saturation, and pore-fluid to elastic rock properties, to elastic-wave velocity, and to impedance. These laws describe, for instance, the connection between seismic impedance and velocity and bulk reservoir properties.Often, an earth volume under examination has to be described by more that one rock physics law: Different depth intervals may have distinctively different velocity-porosity trends due to variations in depositional and diagenetic history. When building a rock physics model, one has to single out various velocity-porosity trends from the entire volume of data and assign these separate trends to appropriate depth intervals and depositional sequences. This procedure is called rock physics diagnostic. It is typically conducted on well log and core data. Rock physics diagnostic yields useful relations between seismic observables and porosity. It also leads to a description of the texture of rock, as shown in this paper. The combination of rock physics with stratigraphy provides a basis for interpreting seismic data away from a well. This combination also forms the basis, in a 3D volume, for predicting porosity and the types of fluid present, and for estimating strength.In order to dispose of significant volumes of drill cuttings and fluids into an unconsolidated formation, it is necessary to fracture the formation. A number of injection mechanisms are possible; and the dominating mechanism depends on the leak characteristics of the disposal formation, the direction of minimum principal stress in the formation, the injection sequence of the cuttings, and the physical properties of the formation. This paper focuses on the strength and sonic properties of shaley sandstone Static and Dynamic Properties of Shaley SandstoneFor this purpose, new laboratory data have been obtained on a sandstone core with large amounts of clay. The core was taken from the depth interval 10118 ft to 10197 ft.The data have been analyzed, first, to establish relations between the static and dynamic elastic moduli of the rock and its failure characteristics. Relations have been established between the static Young? modulus and Poisson? ratio on the one hand and the dynamic shear modulus on the other hand. These relations allow one to predict the static moduli from velocity well log data. The relations areE_Static = -0.34 + 0.59 G_Dynamic; R= 0.96PR_Static = 0.37 0.0208 G_Dynamic; R-0.99where E_Static and PR_Static are the static Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, respectively, and G_Dynamic is the dynamic shear modulus. The quantity &quot;R&quot; refers to the correlation coefficient for these two relationships based on the experimental data. All moduli are in GPa. The dynamic shear modulus is the product of the bulk density times the shear-wave velocity squared (Figure 1).

Nagel(Phillips Petroleum Company),,,,,,ARMA-01-0133,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,":For the compacting reservoirs of the North Sea, acid fracturing has shown to be an economical means of stimulating vertical wells. However, when applying the same practice in horizontal wells, the wells often encounter casing deformation problems significantly earlier than vertical wells. A 3D finite element model that simulates fluid production through a well in a deforming reservoir was developed. The model was used to analyze the influence of well stimulation on the rate and morphology of horizontal well casing deformations. Results from the model show that the model provides an effective tool to identify possible mechanisms that cause casing deformations in horizontal wells treated by acid fracturing. The improved understanding of the deformation mechanisms achieved by the model provides a guide in the selection of the most appropriate treatment for a horizontal well in chalk reservoirs. Numerical simulations over a wide range of operating conditions were performed using the model to establish quantitative relationships between casing deformation and key control variables. Modeling results for representative cases and the description and formulation of the finite element model are also presented in the paper.INTRODUCTIONFor hydrocarbon reservoirs with weak formations, high frequency of well casing deformation induced by reservoir compaction was generally observed during oil/gas production operations (e.g., Yudovich et al. 1989, Schwall Denney, 1994, Fredrich et al. 1998, Nagel, 2000). In general, the casing deformation mechanisms are complicated and inextricably linked with reservoir characteristics, in-situ geology, well configuration and completions, and reservoir production management. Different types of casing deformation mechanisms, that include shear, buckling, bending, traction, and compression, etc., can be triggered by the reservoir compaction process, Thus, for a specific oil/gas field, it would be very difficult to implement a program for mitigating casing deformation without a better understanding of the physical mechanism that caused the problem. Finite element modeling has been employed by many investigators (e.g., Chia Bradley 1989, Yudovich et al. 1989, Hamilton et al. 1992, Hilbert et al. 1998) as an effective tool to gain insights of casing deformation problems caused by reservoirock compaction. In particular, finite element models that properly simulate the primary physics of a casing deformation mechanism, can provide useful quantitative information and an increased understanding of the physical parameters of the mechanism.In this paper, a 3-dimensional, finite element model was developed to numerically investigate a horizontal well casing deformation problem induced by well stimulation in a compacting reservoir. Acid fracturing has been a common practice for stimulating vertical wells to improve productivity in the chalk reservoirs at the North Sea. When applying the same practice in horizontal wells, these wells experience casing deformation problems much earlier than in vertical wells. Based on casing deformation data from field measurements, it is postulated that well stimulation by acid fracturing may create cavities around the perforated zone of the treated well. For a horizontal well, the created cavity can result in vertical load shifting along the axis of the horizontal well. The shifted vertical load will induce sharply higher stress increases in casing and speedup the casing collapse process. For a vertical well, the created cavity will cause horizontal load shifting along the vertical direction of the well. During oil/gas production, this effect of horizontal load shifting for the vertical casing may give a slower rate on casing collapse",,American Rock Mechanics Association

These measurements were conducted using extensional wave pulse propagation and resonance over a 1 9 kHz frequency range for a hydrostatic confining pressure of 8.3 MPa. Analysis of the extensional wave data and the corresponding Xray CT images of the gas saturation show strong attenuation resulting from the presence of the gas (QE dropped from 300 for the dry sand to 30 for the partially-saturated sand), with larger attenuation at a given saturation resulting from heterogeneous gas distributions. The extensional wave velocities are in agreement with Gassmann theory for the test with near-homogeneous gas saturation and with a patcry saturation model for the test with heterogeneous gas saturation. These results show that partially-saturated sands under moderate confining pressure can produce strong intrinsic attenuation for extensional waves.INTRODUCTIONThe acoustic properties of poorly-consolidated sands is a topic of importance in a number of fields, including geotechnical investigation of soil properties for stability (Stoll, 1989; Ishihara, 1996), environmental monitoring of contaminants in the shallow subsurface (Geller and Myer, 1995; Seifert et al., 1998), and geophysical characterization of sand reservoirs and aquifers for petroleum production (Gardner et al., 1964) and CO2 sequestration (Eiken et al., 2000).Poorly-consolidated sands can be viewed as an end-member of the spectrum of naturally-occurring granular materials, with tight sandstones as the other end-member. From a macroscopic scale, poorly consolidated sand might appear as a deceptively simple porous granular material. However, the strong stress sensitivity of sand packings, along with the added complexities resulting from the presence of clay, and multiple fluid and gas phases, conspire to make the present understanding of this class of materials incomplete.Systematic studies of these effects over a broad frequency-range are required for a comprehensive understanding of the acoustic properties of poorly consolidated sands. The overall objective of our research program on sands is to investigate the role of partial gas saturation on the attenuation and velocity of acoustic waves in the seismic to sonic frequency range (1 Hz to 20 kHz) over a range of confining pressures. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a sonic frequency apparatus that utilizes resonance and pulse propagation to measure the velocities and attenuation of poorly consolidated sands under hydrostatic confinement. The confining vessel is fabricated of aluminum, allowing the gas and fluid phases to be imaged with an X-ray CT scanner. In this paper, we report our recent efforts to measure the extensional wave velocities and attenuation of a Monterey sand with homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions of gas.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

A combination of backscatter electron microprobelement analysis and image analysis is used to create colour image element maps. These combination maps of the elements Si/AI/K and Fe/Ti/Ca, give spatial information on quartz, feldspars, clay minerals, carbonate and the weathering products at an accuracy of 3 gtm. The images are used to create binary maps on defined elements, such as gains. The resulting dataset consists of area parameters like area percentages of minerals and porosity. These false colour presentations of various minerals clearly show the integrity of the grains in the hard grain framework. Weathering of mainly feldspars and cementation by carbonates are clearly visible and contribute to the understanding of the grain framework integrity. Feature properties like distributions of grain sizes, perimeter, grain contact lengths and orientations are measured on the binary maps. Combining area and perimeter properties for specified grains give the number of grain contacts per grain and per measure frame. Recent laboratory experiments on compacted grain aggregates combined with image analysis and modelling work, indicate that the gathered data in this study also can be used for the development of a micro-model on compaction. When the scale of this investigation is considered, one can think of the use of drilling cuttings as samples for reservoir integrity characterization.INTRODUCTIONReservoir performance with respect to pore characteristics and related mechanical behaviour is largely based on large-scale petrophysical bulk measurements. Increasing reservoir depth and the related rise in overburden stress play an important role in reservoir integrity. Depletion induced compaction is significant phenomenon to be considered. Pore/stress data information is based on log readings (ca. 15 cm resolution) and core/plug measurements (ca. t0 -tOO cm3). Mechanical test results on usually damaged and stress relaxed cores and plugs, need a careful interpretation. Long-term predictions, as needed for integrity, are also formulated by the condition of the reservoir rock texture and mineral content. These are essential when aspects such as reservoir collapse and subsidence are considered. Hence, the ensuing questions are relevant for the texture quality:&sect; What is the mineral composition and content of the reservoir rock, at microscopic level.&sect; Which effects of a compressive situation on the reservoir rock can be deduced from the mineral grain configuration.&sect; What geo-mechanical effects can be recognized and calculated, using texture images.Nine North Sea reservoir samples, originally from corings of two reservoirs, are used to find ways to visualise and measure relevant texture features (Wolf et al., 1998). The samples are from: A. Fulmar fmt., Upper Jurassic, depth -5. t kin. B. Skaggerak fmt., Triassic, depth -4.4 km deep. It is given, that samples from reservoir A show a growing compressibility with stresses above 45 MPa depletion. It goes with pervasive grain breakage and pore collapse. Samples from reservoir B show a constant compressibility up to 70 MPa depletion (Schutjens, 1998).On micro-scale both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) give a visual impression on the spatial relation between minerals phases and the pore related matrix. These methods only provide limited and subjective information on the relation between minerals and grain framework quality.

Defining the stress path with depletion through time AS?/APp as ,4, we find the critical value of`4 to be 0.67 based on Coulomb faulting theory and a coefficient of friction of 0.6. In situ stress and pore pressure data from the Valhall and Ekofisk oil fields in the North Sea indicate that production-induced pore pressure reductions cause poroelastic reductions of the least principal stress. As a result, normal faulting appears to have spread out from the crests of the structures to the flanks. Pore pressure and stress changes accompanying production in the McAllen Ranch field in South Texas indicates that ,4 ranges from 0.3-0.4 which imply that production-induced normal faulting is not likely to occur.INTRODUCTIONWhile it is well known that fluid injection can induce faulting in oil and gas reservoirs, several studies have reported that both fluid withdrawal and fluid injection appear to have induced active faulting (see review by Grasso, 1992).Active faulting in oil and gas reservoirs is of importance for a variety of reasons. Slip on active faults appears to be the cause of sheared casings of production wells in some fields (Maury et al., 1992) and, in others, shear slip on pre-existing faults and bedding planes appears to be a serious source of wellbore instability during drilling (e.g., Willson et al., 1998). Critically stressed faults in many low permeability reservoirs (i.e., faults that are active in the present stress field) contribute importantly to the overall reservoir permeability (Finkbeiner et al., 1998; Dohlakia et al., 1998). Meanwhile, reactivation of reservoir bounding faults can cause a loss of seal capacity and leakage to occur (e.g., Wiprut Zoback, 1999). Slip on active faults may also control the vertical extent of hydrocarbon column that a fault-bounded reservoir can contain (e.g., Finkbeiner et al., 2000).Mechanisms of Production-Induced FaultingIncreases in pore pressure can cause slip along preexisting faults by reduction of the effective normal stress on the fault plane as described in the Coulomb failure criterion:[Equation available in full paper]where x is the shear stress on the fault, Sa is the normal stress, Pp is the pore pressure and !a is the coefficient of friction (c.f., Jaeger Cook, 1971). Thus, by raising Pp, the effective normal stress, Sa Pp on pre-existing faults is reduced. A fault can therefore slip at a lower shear stress than would normally be required.Another mechanism of induced faulting in the vicinity of oil and gas reservoirs is poroelastic stress changes in the medium surrounding a compacting reservoir (Segall, 1985, 1989, 1992). In this case, faulting is induced by the superposition of preexisting stresses with the stresses caused by pore pressure decreases in the reservoir.We discuss a third mechanism in this paper by which normal faulting is related to changes in poroelastic stress within the reservoir themselves. We demonstrate that the stress path associated with reservoir production is such that in some reservoirs the poroelastic decrease in the least horizontal stress can lead to normal faulting in the reservoirs. These processes may be active in several oil and gas fields where normal faulting within reservoirs appears to have been induced by hydrocarbon production (c.f., Doser et al., 1991).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

It is solved in an explicit scheme. The pores and pipes are associated with the particle model. They are updated with the deformation and damage development of the solid part. The fluid pressure around a particle is integrated and applied to the particle. The fundaments of the coupling scheme and some modeling results are presented in this paper.INTRODUCTIONHydrocarbons are often produced with pore pressure depletion. This changes the in-situ effective stresses in the reservoir. The stress changes may induce damage and shear-enhanced compaction, which may affect the permeability of the reservoir materials. Reliable estimates of permeability and its stress de-pendence are crucial to successful planning and management of petroleum reservoirs. Many researchers have investigated the relatioaship between permeability changes and stress changes. When porous materials deform elastically the permeability reduction is quite small and can often he predicted by, for example, the semi-empirical Kozeny-Carman equation (Holt, 2000). Network models can also make good evaluation of the permeability (Bryant, 1993). When the materials yield, however, significant permeability alteration may occur (Holt, 1990; Bruno, 1994; Ruistuen, 1997; Ferfera et al., 1997; Bout?ca et al., 2000). The permeability change of the reservoir materials depends on the constitutive mechanical behavior of the rock (dilatancy or non-dilatancy) and on the stress path. A rigid relationship is not yet established. Particle models have been applied to study mechanical properties of weakly cemented sandstones with success (Ruistuen, 1997; Holt et al., 2000). Compared to laboratory experiments, numerical modeling is economic and efficient. The parameters in numerical models are easy to change, and hence can he thoroughly studied. Numerical modeling is a good tool to improve the design of experiments and the data interpretation, even though it is not a substitution.Combining it with a flow network model, Bruno (1994) applied a discrete particle model to study stress-induced permeability anisotropy. Considering the mutual effects between the fluid and solid part, fluid coupled particle models have been developed (Cundall, 1999) and applied to study stress dependent permeability (Li et al., 2000).This paper presents a numerical scheme of the fluid coupled particle model (2D) and results by applying the model to study stress dependent permeability.

The primary influence on parting behavior is shear bonding at the granular scale. We also investigate slurry injection processes in granular media by coupling fluid flow simulators with particle models for several near wellbore assemblies. Although there are clear challenges remaining with scaling issues and practical model size, we conclude that coupled particle and fluid flow codes can simulate slurry injection processes well, reproducing dilation and parting patterns consistent with laboratory observations and pressure response consistent with field observations.INTRODUCTIONThere are several important petroleum, mining, and environmental engineering applications that involve large-scale deformation, failure, and fluid flow processes in weakly consolidated media. These include gravel injection and &quot;frae-pack&quot; operations to both stimulate a well and provide sanding control, grout injection to create barriers for contaminant flow in porous media, and slurry waste injection in deep wells. Unfortunately, the geomechanical aspects and controls on such operations remain poorly understood. Continuum models have difficulty capturing the basic physical processes of microcracking, disaggregation, and grain movement that occur during fracture and slurry injection in weakly consolidated media. These are inherently &quot;discontinuous&quot; failure processes. Traditional fracture mechanics approaches are particularly ill suited for modeling such phenomena because they are fundamentally based on stress singularities and strain energy dissipation processes at an advancing fracture tip. Fracture or &quot;parting&quot; of weakly consolidated media with near zero shear strength, however, is dominated by energy dissipatedeforming, shearing, and dilating material over a large area; fracture toughness and traditional tip mechanics are relatively inconsequential. The objective of our research, funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Alberta Department of Energy, has been to develop an improved understanding of such processes by developing alternative modeling techniques. One component of our effort has involved coupled particle and fluid flow modeling.In this paper we first present an overview of traditional linear elastic fracture mechanics, starting from first energy principles and extending to the stress intensity factor approach common to most hydraulic fracture models. We describe the limitations of such models when considering distributed damage proc-esses involved in fracture and parting of weakly consolidated media, and suggest an alternative approach using discrete particle modeling techniques. We investigate and conclude that particle models can capture observed physical processes in weakly cemented media, providing insights on material parameters which influence a change from discrete brittle fracturing (as occurs in stiff and strong geomaterial) to general dilation and parting (as occurs in very soft and weak geomaterials).

We then describe the development of constitutive models for the overburden formations, reservoir formations, and underlying strata. 3D reservoir fluid flow and geomechanical models that cover portions of Sections 4, 5, 32, and 33 were developed. Black oil reservoir simulations were performed that included 229 wells and modeled 17 years of primary production and waterflooding. The timedependent reservoir pressures were then used as input to non-linear finite element geomechanical simulations. The simulations predict surface subsidence and shearing displacements in the subsurface that can result in well casing damage. Multiple simulations were performed to assessensitivity to the initial stress state and to the friction coefficient at the contact surfaces that are used to model the behavior of thin claystones.INTRODUCTIONThe shallow diatomaceous oil reservoirs located in Kern County, California are susceptible to depletion-induced compaction because of the high porosity (45-60%) and large vertical extent of the producing formation. More than a thousand wells at the Belridge and Lost Hills fields have experienced severe casing damage as the reservoir pressures have been drawn down. The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the geomechanical behavior by integrated analyses of field data, experimental measurement of rock mechanical behavior, and numerical simulation of the reservoir and overburden behavior during primary and secondary recovery. In our work, time-dependent reservoir pressures derived from three-dimensional (3d) black oil reservoir simulations are coupled unidirectionally and applied as loads in 3d nonlinear finite element geomechanical simulations. Central to the numerical modeling is the use of sophisticated material models that accurately capture the nonlinear deformation behavior of the reservoir rock, including inelastic compaction (yield) at stress states below the shear failure surface.Fredrich et al. (2000) described development of 3d geomechanical models for the Belridge field and historical simulations that were performed of sections 33 and 29 using the quasi-static largedeformation structural mechanics finite element code JAS3D. The historical simulations served to validate both the conceptual model that was formulated for casing damage and the modeling approaches. That work also showed that geomechanical simulation could be applied as a reservoir management tool to optimize production and injection policies, and to identify the most economical density and spacing of production and injection wells during infill drilling.Following the successful application at Belddge, attention shifted to Lost Hills.

Technical developments in the field of two-phase flow are of great importance for improving the understanding of underground inundation and gas outbursts, in order to reduce the risks to personnel. The paper describes recent advances in the understanding of two-phase (airwater) stratified flow. A new constitutive model is presented, based upon an extension of Darcy's Law and using the concept of relative permeability. The proposed model is verified by experimental results using 'state of the art' Two Phase High Pressure Triaxial Apparatus (TPHPTA). This study presents the results of laboratory testing that will enable the development of a relationship between roughness (Joint Roughness Coefficient, JRC) and the flow rate for steady state conditions.INTRODUCTIONFracture roughness in the form of the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) is acknowledged to have a fundamental impact on the hydromechanical properties of discontinuous media. Previous studies (Barton et al, 1985) have used a series of standard roughness profiles that enable the estimation of fracture hydraulic conductivity. This relationship has also been examined in terms of gas flow (Schrauf Evans, 1986). With the onset of research into twophase flow, several different approaches have been adopted. A number of studies have considered applied numerical techniques, typically using fractures generated with various mathematical models (Rasmussen, 1991). Laboratory studies have also been carried out using artificial fi'actures (Fourar et al, 1993). The nature of two-phase flow is of practical interest to civil and mining engineering projects especially with regard to the storage of waste in fraetured rock mass and minerals extraction in the mining and petroleum industries.The aim of the current research program is to study the effect of roughness on fracture aperture and two-phase flow behaviour for both natural and induced fractures, extending over a range of JRC values. A further objective is to evaluate the effect of capillary pressure, phase interference and fracture roughness on the relative permeability and twophase flow behaviour.In underground rock mass, excavation of multiple openings causestress redistribution and associated fitfid flow through existing and newly created discontintfities. In the Australian coal industry, the risks from gas outburst and groundwater inundation are still only partially understood, and damage to underground eqtfipment and fatalities occur too frequently. The study of two-phase flow characteristics provides a more thorough understanding of nearfield pore pressure variations associated with the redistribution of stresses. Phase interference and the 'blocking-off' of pockets of gas can lead to 1ocalised pressure concentrations that can result in outburst. It is hoped that from the better understanding of fracture characteristics obtained in the laboratory, the field behaviour can be more accurately predicted so that the risks from outburst and inundation can be controlled more effectively.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Two-dimensional model results of the fractal dimension D and the invasion probability of a throat on the interface are in excellent agreement with predictions for limiting cases of Capillary number Ca and Bond number Bo. In moving from twoto three-dimensional media, trapped wetting clusters do not scale with the extent of the invading cluster, remaining under 5 to 8 pores in size.INTRODUCTIONTwo-phase flow in a porous medium has been an active area of research for more than five decades. Representative Elementary Volume (REV) assumptions, coupled with continuum concepts (Bear 1972), have provided the fundamental basis for most largescale models of two-phase flow. Recent experimental and theoretical work (Lenormand 1989, Baveye Sposito 1984), however, show that such models fail to represent accurately both very slow and buoyancy dominated processes. This results in their inability to incorporate appropriately the influence of pore-scale mechanics on the geometry of the nonwetting fluid cluster at a macroscopic scale.Percolation theory has received increasing attention for providing both a quantitative and conceptual framework for describing all types of two-phase flow phenomena (Yortsos et al. 1997, Xu et al. 1998, Hirsch Thompson 1995). Although Ordinary Percolation (OP) theory was initially used to describe the final fluid configuration observed following (slow) immiscible displacement processes, it was the introduction of the Invasion Percolation (IP) model by Wilkinson Willemsen, 1983 that allowed for a more complete investigation of the entire displacement process. Numerous experimental studies validate the use of IP to describe very slow immiscible displacement, yet it is not an appropriate model when spatial gradients in the capillary pressure Pc are present. Such gradients include not only viscous and buoyancy related gradients in the nonwetting fluid, but also gradients associated with viscous forces in the wetting fluid and with spatial variations in the permeability k (Chaouche et al. 1994, Meakin et al. 1992). The Invasion Percolation in a Gradient (IPG) model is capable of including all of these factors.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

We include the effects of local aperture field variability to channelize flow within a fluid phase and capillarity to smooth the displacement front. Model behavior is illustrated over a limited set of simulations in both a Hele-Shaw cell, and a variable aperture field that is correlated well below the simulation scale.INTRODUCTIONThe issue of immisicble displacement of one fluid by another rises in the context of enhanced oil recovery, remediation of nonaqueous phase liquids, CO2 sequestration, and other applied geologic problems. In discrete fractures, accessibility will combine with competition between capillary, gravity, and viscous forces to control the displacement process. Here we focus on behavior in a single horizontal fracture at the sub-meter scale for conditions where viscous forces cannot be ignored. Immiscible displacement processes can (and have been) modeled using a number of different approaches that may be broadly categorized as continuum or discrete. In continuum approaches, one either: 1) solves the Navier-Stokes equations for each fluid within complex geometry, and separated by a moving boundary where kinetic and dynamic boundary conditions must be met; or, 2) describes the system as a two-phase continuum with relative permeability and pressure-saturation relations defined for both fluids at every point. In the discrete approaches, a set of local 'rules' are applied to model pore-scale behavior; broad categories of rules include: 1) Particle interaction models (PIM) such as cellular automata, lattice-Boltzman, or lattice-gas where large quantities of particles simultaneously move and interact according to a list of rules; 2) Invasion percolation (IP) where individual apertures along the fluid-fluid interface are filled according to local accessibility and capillary criteria; and, 3) Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) in which random particles moving through the displaced fluid are used to identify locations on the interface for advancement.Both the Navier-Stokes and PIM approaches are currently limited by the difficulty of defining the fluid-fluid interface, and computational requirements at our scale of interest. Two-phase continuum approaches are computationally tractable, but do not correctly include the physics of displacement processes; i.e. the fluid phases intermingle where they should be separate. IP and DLA have potential at the scale of interest, both are growth models that encapsulate the critical unit process (aperture filling), and iterate that process to yield large scale behavior. The basic IP process models capillary dominated horizontal displacements on a random aperture field. However, IP has recently been modified to include gravity and the dynamic calculation of interfacial curvature at the fluid-fluid interface within a fracture (e.g. Glass, 1993, Glass et al., 1998). The latter, termed MIP, yields simulated behavior that matches experimental measurements quite well. In addition, there have also been recent attempts to further include viscous forces in IP or MIP (Xu et al., 1998, Ewing Berkowitz, 1998) with excellent correspondence to experiments in heterogeneous porous media where capillary, gravity, and viscous forces all played a role (Glass et al., in press).Here we focus on a DLA based approach for simulating fluid-fluid displacement.

For single phase flow, the macroscopic permeability of the network has been systematically computed; the main parameters are the fracture density, the ratio between the characteristic fracture and porous medium permeabilifies. Some results are presented and discussed; they show the importance of the percolafion threshold of the fracture network and possibly of the porous matrix. The same work is underway for twophase flow. The unsteady non-linear equations are solved in the same general setting. The method of solution is presented, together with illustrative simulation results.INTRODUCTIONConsider a set of permeable fractures embodied in a permeable porous solid matrix. When a fluid is flowing through such a medium, the fractures and the porous matrix interact. Historically, this complex situation was first addressed by Barenblatt Zheltoy 0960) and Barenblatt et al. 0960); though these papers motivated many further works, progress in this area has been slow and so far no complete solution of this problem for any fracture network and for any permeability distribution in the porous matrix has been described to the best of our knowledge in the literature.Warren Root (1963) modeled a fractured porous rock as an idealized system made up of identical rectangular porous parallelepipeds separated by an orthogonal network of fractures. Flow is assumed to take place in the fracture network which is fed by the porous blocks. This sort of model was further developed by Odeh (1965). All these equations have been thoroughly studied in the literature with many different boundary conditions (van Golf-Racht 1982, Chen 1989, Chen 1990 and Pinder 1993). Other possible approaches have also been presented by Adler Thovert 0999). The most important is probably the multiscale analysis of flow through fractured porous media, initiated by Aifantis (1980) and extended by Arbogast (1990), Levy 0988, 1990) and Panfilov (1990,1994).The purpose of this paper is to briefly present the methodology and the first results obtained in the determination of the single-phase permeability of fractured porous media. It is a significant extension of our previous paper on the permeability of fractured media Koudina et al. (1998).

In-depth data analyseshowed that the difference might be due to the secondary stress field induced by the packers. A three-dimensional, non-linear module from a comn?rcial numerical simulator (ABAQUS) was used to model the stress field in the tested blocks. It is found that when the packer is working properly, it transfers tensile stress concentration from the packer edge to the central section of the sealed borehole and forms a longitudinal stress concentration band. This band induces a longitudinal fracture initiated from the wall of the sealed section. On the other hand, if the packer malfunctions, high tensile stress concentrations will be induced at its edges. As a result, circular tensile stress concentration bands form which eventually initiate transverse fractures.INTRODUCTIONPackers are widely used in both field hydraulic fracturing (I-IF) operations (Brown et al. 2000) and laboratory experiments (Guo et al. 1993, Morita et al. 1996, Wilson et al. 1999). The primary function of packers is to seal the pressurized section from the rest of the borehole.There have been many investigations on the influence of packers. While most of them were concemed with field applications, some involved topics related to laboratory work. yon Schoenfeldt Fairhurst (1969) were the first to mention that the stress field in the borehole would be influenced by the type of packer, though no quantitative results were given in their paper. Using a 2-D FEM simulator, Roegiers et al. (1973) investigated the distribution of longitudinal and circumferencial stresses in the borehole near a packer. Both influences of the packer rigidity and the steel mandrel length were studied. Ong (1994) investigated the function of different packers on laboratory tests of inclined boreholes and developed an epoxy to backup the packers located in the borehole, limiting their inherent deformation.In a recent experimental study, longitudinal and transverse fractures were observed in two different laboratory tests, which were run under the same conditions except for the packer length. The purpose of those HF experiments was to investigate the fracture initiation and propagation in asymmetrical stress field situations. The one with a longer packer showed normal fracturing behavior, which means the fracture initiated on the borehole wall in the sealed section and propagated in the direction of higher stresses (Scott et al. 2000). On the other hand, the one with a shorter packer showed transverse fracturing behavior, that is, the fracture initiated at the end of the packer and propagated in the direction perpendicular to the borehole.Due to the complexity of the applied stress, the previously mentioned 2-D FEM modeling could not fully explain the results. In order to understand these phenomena, 3-D FEM numerical modeling using ABAQUS was carried out.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

One techniquemployed by NIOSH for determining in situ stress has been hydraulic fracturing from boreholes drilled in mine. However, in some cases the combined rock strength and stress magnitude have been too high to allow successfid stress determination using available hydraulic fracturing equipment. NIOSH developed high pressure straddle and impression packers capable of operating at pressures up to 103 MPa in a 51 mm diameter borehole. The high pressure hydraulic fracturing system was used to measure horizontal and vertical stresses in a western Pennsylvania limestone mine with a high incidence of stress related roof failures. Breakdown pressures ranged from 43.9 to 95.7 MPa and in two cases the rock could not be broken down even at the maximum system pressure, 103 MPa. The estimated ranges for the maximum horizontal principal stresses were 27.2 to 65.9 MPa. The measured vertical stress was 3.8 MPa. The calculated K ratio was betweeh 7 and 17. The stress directions, determined from the crack directions in roof and floor holes, were N76&oslash;E and N66&oslash;E, respectively. Because of the high breakdown pressures required to initiate the fractures, neither of the horizontal stress measurements could have been made with any other existing hydraulic fracturing equipment. The author believes the packers represent a significant improvement in the state of the art of in situ stress measurement under near mine conditions.INTRODUCTIONResearch conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) over the last decade has shown that horizontal stress can have a significant effect upon the success or failure of underground mines (Molinda et al. 1992, Mark Mucho 1994). Recent studies by NIOSH have documented cases in both coal (Dolinar et al. 2000) and limestone (Iarmacchione et al. 1998) mines where understanding and mitigating the effects of horizontal stress have been critical to the safety and continued operation of mines. Research (Agapito et al. 1980, Mark Mucho 1994) has also shown that horizontal stresses in the range of 10 to 30 MPa, at mining depths from a few tens of meters to well below 1000 m, once characterized as &quot;high&quot; are actually a predictable consequence of plate tectonics (Zoback Zoback, 1989).An important part of NIOSH's recent research efforts has been the development of methods to identify the conditions under which horizontal stress adversely affects mining operations, and making the mining industry aware of both the effects of horizontal stress and the means of mitigating these effects. NIOSH and others have used several techniques to measure horizontal stress and assess its potential for causing ground control problems, including the &quot;stress mapping&quot; technique (Mucho Mark 1994), direct measurement of strain, generally through overcoring and the technique of interest in this paper, the hydraulic fracturing method. This technique is sufficiently well documented to be standardized under ASTM Designation D 4645-87.Although ASTM D 4645-87 is applicable to any depth, the standard is primarily concerned with stress measurements conducted in vertical boreholes drilled from the surface, rather than from underground mine sites, from which most of NIOSH's stress testing has been conducted. Most of the equipment used for conducting hydraulic fracturing stress measurements has been developed as an outgrowth of the oilfield technique of hydraulic fracturing to increase oil and gas production and is of",,American Rock Mechanics Association

In a series of tests in which &oacute;h, &oacute;v, and Po were kept constant throughout, breakdown pressure Pc increased significantly with wellbore pressurization rate, but appeared to asymptotically tend to an upper and a lower bound. These bounds correspond to fast and slow rates, respectively, as expected by Detournay-Cheng criterion. However, tests conducted at a preset pressurization rate in unjacketed specimens (&oacute;h = Po) revealed that (PcPo) increased with confining/pore pressure, contrary to the constant (PcPo) predicted by the Detournay-Cheng criterion.

The fracture is driven by injection of an incompressible fluid with power-law rheology. The numerical model, which is formulated in terms of a moving coordinates system, is based on the displacement discontinuity method and on an explicit finite difference scheme. The accuracy of the algorithm is validated against the available self-similar solution for a Newtonian fluid.INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing (HF) is a technique widely used to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas from the reservoir formations towards the extracting wells. The uncertainty about the in situ conditions, the complexity of the mechanisms taking place and the difficulty in obtaining precise measurements of the fracture geometry, make necessary the use of idealized models (e.g., the KGD or &quot;plane-strain&quot; model, the &quot;pennyshaped&quot; or radial model and the PKN model) for studying this process.Even with these simplified models, the mathematical formulation for the propagation of hydraulic fractures is given by a relatively complicated system of integral and non-linear differential equations. Some analytical solutions of these mathematical models are already available (Spence Sharp, 1985; Savitski Detournay, 1999; Garagash, 2000; Savitski, 2000; Adachi, 2001; Adachi et al., 2001). However, these solutions are constructed on the basis of various restrictive assumptions (e.g., constant injection rate; very small or very large material toughness, Newtonian theology for the fracturing fluid, no fluid leakoff, etc.). In order to extend the applicability of these models, it is necessary to release some of these assumptions and consequently, the solution of the governing equations demands the use of numerical techniques.Commonly, the numerical solution of non-linear problems is restricted to the use of implicit schemes. Explicit schemes are not often applied in this type of problems due to the difficulty in reaching numerical stability, even though the latter are simpler to implement. In this paper, we introduce an explicit finite difference scheme with a moving mesh that can be used to simulate the propagation of a KGD hydraulic fracture. This scheme is shown to be numerically stable, accurate and &quot;flexible&quot;, in the sense that additional features (e.g., fluid leak-off, poroelastic effects, etc.) can be easily incorporated into the model (Detournay et al., 1990).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Measurements undertaken to successfully introduce hydraulic fracturing to Moonee and pressure records routinely obtained from each treatment provide a unique opportunity to develop and test a new model of hydraulic fracture growth near a free surface. This paper presents the results of the comparison for several fracture treatments, demonstrating that the model is able to match the treatment data.INTRODUCTIONMoonee Colliery is owned and operated by Coal Operations Australia Limited and the mine is located just south of Newcastle, NSW at Catherine Hill Bay. Mining extracts 3.2 m of the Great Northern seam, leaving, on average, 1.8 m of roof coal and claystone above the seam. This weak roof coal sequence typically caves immediately behind the supports leaving the 30 to 35 m thick conglomerate section bridging the 100 m wide longwall panel.Hydraulic fracturing is used at Moonee Colliery to grow fractures in the roof rock behind the face. The fractures formed are horizontal and parallel to the base of the conglomerate. Their growth produces caving of the massive conglomerate roof strata at an interval designed to avoid natural caving events. A new model that accounts for the strong interaction of the hydraulic fracture with the base of the roof conglomerate (a free surface) has been developed. The development and application of the model are the subject of this paper.down both toward the rib line and the face.

The resulting data base is used for testing a numerical model dedicated to the analysis of such hydro-mechanical interactions. These measurements were performed in an open hole section, isolated from shallower zones by a packer set at a depth of 275 m and extending down to 840m. They consisted in a series of flow meter injection tests, at increasing injection rates. Field results showed that conductive fractures form a dynamic and interdependent network, that individual fracture zones could not be adequately modeled as independent systems, that new fluid intakes zones appeared when pore pressure exceeded the minimum principal stress magnitude in that well, and that pore pressures much larger than this minimum stress could be further supported by the circulated fractures. These characteristics raise the question of the influence of the morphology of the natural fracture network in a rock mass under anisotropic stress conditions on the effects of hydromechanical couplings.INTRODUCTIONCharacterizing and modeling the hydromechanical behavior of a natural fractured rock mass still remains a challenging problem in rock mechanics. Multiple disciplines that were often used independently are now being integrated and we may expect significant improvements of our understanding. Flow through single fractures of varying apertures is generally investigated (see the review by Zimmerman Bodvarsson, 1996) as a function of aperture distribution parameters and contact area. The effect of normal stress to explain the deviation from the well known cubic law at large stress levels, at the sample scale or at larger scale as reported by Raven Gale (1985) is also widely discussed. Numerous empirical models have been proposed for the normal closure behavior of joints (Bandis, 1983, Brown Scholz, 1985). The relationships between the fracture stiffness, as a link between the hydraulic and seismic properties of a single natural fracture are also reported (Pyrak-Nolte, 1992). Unger Mase (1993) propose a theoretical model where the aperture distribution is determined during the closure of two random elastic surfaces. During closure, asperities that come into contact deform elastically and deformations are transmitted through the infinite halfspace to neighboring asperities. Capasso a1.(1999) use a similar approach using an elasto-plastic behavior for the contact zones. Both approaches lead to a non linear dependency between normal stress, ratio of contact area and mean closure. They provide at each stress levels the parameters required by Zimmerman and Bodvarsson (1996) formalism to derive the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of a rough fracture.An application at the field scale of coupled models using such non linear stress-closure relationships is illustrated by Rutqvist (1995) on single fractures isolated in vertical bore holes by two impermeable packers. The purpose was to determine their normal stiffness from well tests, namely pulse tests and hydraulic jacking tests. However the tensile situation could not properly be reproduced in these simulations without starting to adjust additional parameters, like the fracture size, the fluid pressure at the fracture tip or the Young's modulus of the surrounding rock blocks. Coupling between flow along a given fracture and stresses across this fracture under site specific conditions is therefore dependent upon the global mechanical behavior of the host rock and the hydraulic conditions at the fracture boundaries or at intersections with other fractures, that will control the ov",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Field and laboratory observations show that an initially circular crack (or notch) in a layered media can often turn into a highly elongated fracture. Such fracture containment is often assumed, rather than modeled directly. In the method presented here the simulation of the phenomenon is based on a model of elliptical crack propagation in a 3D layered poro-elastic body. The global Griffith-type fracture criterion and an anisotropic fracture toughness parameter (specific fracture energy of rock) are employed. A computer code based on the proposed model is then used to describe a laboratory hydraulic fracture experiment. The large block hydraulic fracture experiment in a layered material (diatomite) is described. The computer simulations with appropriately selected characteristics of the model give results in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements. Possible applications of the model are discussed.IINTRODUCTIONThe present work is concerned with the primary features of hydraulic fracture processes in stratified rock materials. As field and laboratory experiments show, an initially small radial crack (or notch) can often grow significantly more in one direction that results in noticeably non-circular (an oval) geometry. The reason for such crack growth behavior may be fracture anisotropy of the layered medium. There are three apparent causes of a non-circular fracture growth: 1) a non-uniform traction on the crack face, 2) an anisotropy of fracture toughness, and 3) heterogeneity of the fracture toughness resulting from layered structure of the rock.This paper describes a new model for hydraulic fracture in layered media, and its application to a laboratory hydraulic fracture test. The model is developed tirst, followed by a description of the experiment. Computer simulation results of the test are then described, and conclusions drawn.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The fracture is driven by an incompressible Newtonian fluid injected at a constant rate. The flow of viscous fluid in the fracture is governed by the lubrication equation, while the crack opening and the fluid pressure are related by singular integral equations. We construct two asymptotic solutions based on the assumption that the energy expended in the creation of new fracture surfaces is either small or large compared to the energy dissipated in viscous flow. One important outcome of the analysis is to show that the asymptotic solutions, when properly scaled, depend only on the dimensionless parameter ?, the ratio of the fracture radius over the distance from the fracture to the free-surface. The scaled solutions can thus be tabulated and the dependence of the solution on time can be retrieved for specific parameters, through simple scaling and by solving an implicit equation.INTRODUCTIONHydraulic fracturing is the most common method used to stimulate production from gas and oil wells. The fractures are propagated from the well to stimulate reservoirs that are typically located 500 to several thousand meters below the surface. Hydraulic fracture growth at these depths is not affected by the surface of the earth, although surface deformation (tilt) is sometimes measured to infer fracture orientation and size.Although most fractures arising from hydraulic fracture treatments can be conceptualized as propagating within an infinite space, there are specific cases where the influence of a free-surface on the fracture growth becomesignificant or even dominant. Hydraulic fracturing has recently been used in mining to induce and control the timing of rock caving event, see Jeffrey Mills (2000). The work contained in this paper is motivated by hydraulic fracturig used underground at Moonee Colliery to control the timing of roof-rock caving events. At Moonee, a massive conglomerate roof rock does not cave behind the longwall face in a predictable way and, when it does cave, produces a strong windblast in the nearby mine workings. Moonee has adopted hydraulic fracturing as a way to induce the conglomerate to cave in a controlled time period. The hydraulic fractures are formed at the end of 8 m long vertical holes drilled up into the .conglomerate, as shown in Fig. 1. The treatments produce more or less axisymmetric horizontal fractures that grow parallel to and strongly affected by the free surface. Fracture behaviors are characterized by a ratio of the fracture radius over the distance from the free surface which can reach order I or more. (See, also, Pollard Hozlhausen (1979) for a granite quarry example.)The problem of predicting the fluid pressure, opening and size of the fracture given the injection rate, fluid rheology, and rock properties has attracted an extraordinary number of contributions since the 1950s. This intense research activity has contributed to the formulation of a variety of models that emphasize either the design of a hydraulic fracturing treatment, or the exact solution of the coupled fluid-solid problem with simple fracture geometry (Savitski Detournay 2000). However, the influence of a free-surface on the propagation of a fluid-driven fracture has not yet been addressed, except approximately (Jeffrey Settaft, 2000) and by a few contributions dealing with the problem of a uniformly pressurized fracture(Wang et al. 1994).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The effect of an interface on hydraulic fracture confinement in a laminated (stratified) medium has been addressed in a number of analytical and experimental investigations since the early 1960s. The problem of crack interaction with a bimaterial interface, that includes an identification of the power of the stress singularity and evaluation of the stress intensity factor (SIF), is conventionally reduced to a solution of singular integral equations. Numerical techniques are commonly employed in solving the problem. However, numerical solutions of a singular integral equation have in general certain limitations that can lead to numerical errors. Particularly, a recently published solution of the crack interaction with an interface presented in graphic form and tables convenient for applications contains significant numerical errors. The exact (analytical) solution of the problem presented in this paper has been obtained by means of the Weiner-Hopf method. An asymptotic representation of the stress field around the crack tip in a vicinity of an interface is extracted from the exact solution. Particularly, the SIF Green's function due to the unit double force applied at the crack faces is derived for arbitrary distance s of the crack tip from the interface. This paper also introduces an interface toughness index (ITI) X to reflect the potential fracture confinement by the interface. ITI characterizes the crack approach to the interface as stable if X &gt; 1 (K1 --&gt; 0 with &aring;--&gt; 0), or unstable if X &lt; 1 (K1 --&gt; 8 with &aring; --&gt; 0). The interface toughness index ?is a function of both the shear moduli and Poisson's ratios of the materials on both sides of the interface. The stability conditions are different from those published previously. An experimental investigation of this proposition is outlined and various scenarios of fracture propagation and confinement based on crack stability analysis and stress distribution in the vicinity of the crack tip on both sides of the interface are discussed.INTRODUCTIONThe problem of determining the elastic stress field in the vicinity of a crack tip, approaching a bimaterial interface, has various practical applications in layered materials such as laminated composites and stratified rocks and has been addressed by many authors. Here we refer to only a few publications that are directly relevant to the scope of the present work. The very first formulation and solution of the problem for semi-infinite crack perpendicular to the bimaterial interface with the crack tip positioned on the interface is due to Zak Williams (1963). The crack tip fields for a finite crack with its tip at the interface were considered by Khrapkov (1968). This problem is the conjugate one to the problem of a semi-infinite crack perpendicular to the interface with its tip located some distance from the interface (one of the problems considered in the present work) in the sense that both lead to the same Weiner-Hopf equation. Erdogan with co-workers derived singular integral equations and solved them numerically for semi-infinite and finite cracks perpendicular to the interface and fully imbedded in one of the half planes, as well as cracks terminating at and crossing the interface (Cook Erdogan 1972, Erdogan Biricikoglu 1973).",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Paper describes and analyzes different models of cracks, based on which dependencies, denoting strength of materials and methods for calculation of crack propagation, leading to fracture of engineering structures, are developed.INTRODUCTIONFracture mechanics can be used in solutions of rock mechanics problems and first of all in problems of strength of rock materials. Recently large number of criteria of strength of materials is used in engineering practice. All of them postulate that fracture starts at the moment when combination of certain parameters (stresses, strains, temperatures, etc,) at some point reaches critical value. However, regardless that such criteria are widely used by engineers, they are applied only to certain materials and at certain conditions. None of these criteria explains the mechanism of fracture.Numerous experimentshow that fracture of materials normally is determined by the process of formation and propagation of cracks. Investigation of this process is exactly the subject of fracture mechanics, which suggests different mathematical dependencies connecting crack propagation with stresses, strains and strength of materials. These dependencies are usually based on consideration of rock and concrete as linear elastic jointed media. Experimental research also shows, that nonlinear deformation of rocks and concrete is determined by the formation of microcracks, hence regarding fracture as a process of crack grow, fracture mechanics provides means of analyses of rock deformation. The presence of numerous microcracks and heterogeneities in rock materials and concrete causes local stress concentrations which under certain conditions lead to formation of macrocracks. If the propagation of macrocracks under given load is unstable it results in complete failure of material. Fracture mechanics takes into account this fact and offer mathematical models of this phenomenon.It presents many dependencies between the growth of cracks and stress-strain state of materials. All of them are based on the idealization of rocks and concrete as elastic linear continuum containing numerous cracks.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

To study bump mechanisms, conditions in the vicinity of a deep longwall mining face in bump-prone strata were monitored using three discrete systems. First, a microseismic monitoring network recorded mininginduced seismic events throughout the mine and surrounding strata. Second, pressure variations and distributions on the longwall shield legs across the face were recorded. Last, tomography surveys imaged seismic transmission properties ahead of the face. Results from the three systems were correlated in an effort to increase understanding of mining-induced stress redistribution and bump potential. An initial, one-week study showed that the correlation between averaged tomogram values and seismically active areas had a coefficient of correlation (R) of 0.89. Further results of these studies demonstrate that the tomography system is capable of imaging heavy shield-leg loading and bump-prone conditions prior to them disrupting the face operations.INTRODUCTIONThe MineA modem longwall coal mine is a highly mechanized, capital intensive, system, typically producing more than 10,000 tonnes of coal per day with as few as 10 to 15 people operating the face equipment. Any capital-intensive operation must be continuously utilized to optimize the investment. Further, the profit margin for a longwall face is typically five times that of a room and pillar face. Any loss in production time, therefore, quickly translates into lost profits for the mine. Coal bumps, comparable to rock bursts in non-coal mines, are localized seismic events which can rapidly and forcefully eject many tons of coal into the mine openings. These events not only disrupthe mining process, they can also be extremely dangerous to underground personnel. The longwall coal mine at which the monitoring occurred is located in the western United States. The seam is under approximately 800 m of massive competent overburden with a history of mining-related seismicity. Three systems were used to monitor the ground conditions at this underground longwall mine: a microseismic monitoring network, a seismic tomography system and a longwall shield-leg pressure recording system. Results from the monitoring systems were correlated in an effort to determine whether the diverse information could be used synergistically to increase understanding of mining-induced stress redistribution and bump potential.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are cooperating with mines to evaluate how these conditions affect mine opening stability and related miner safety. A system was developed to monitorock and coal stresses during mining of an entire longwall panel. The system was designed to generate data in near real time to evaluate rock behavior in roof strata and the onset of hazardous conditions as overburden stress was redistributed over working entries during gob formation. Computer simulations and inmine evaluations were used to optimize instrument placement. A prototype packer assembly was designed and tested for installing sensitive instruments in a mine roof. This paper provides background information on the stress monitoring concept and focuses on the development of instrument placement techniques and the prototype packer assembly.BACKGROUNDStress monitoring system concept Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in cooperation with a mining company, have developed and continue to refine a stress monitoring and reporting system. The initial objective was to determine if stress monitorng instruments could gather sufficient data to recogize the conditions leading to coal bumps so these conditions could be mitigated with engineering controls before a catastrophic event. During use of the monitoring system, it became apparent that the system could also be a valuable research tool in evaluating rock behavior surrounding mine openngs. The system could also be used to study the technologies designed to maintain safe openings in more challenging ground conditions. Below is a description of the system developed to meet these objectives.The stress monitoring system is comprised of a cluster of instruments (figure 3) placed strategically to detect changes in stress and displacement at a preselected site in the headgate of an operating longwall. These stress changes are initiated near the longwall face as load is redistributed following coal removal and gob formation. Stresses are transferred through roof strata from the area of active mining back to the instrument site. A data acquisition system retrieves data from these instruments at preselected time intervals. Raw data are then processed and reduced and used to generate graphs. These graphs illustrate trends that may be used to evaluate (1) behavior of roof strata above mine openings, (2) imminent catastrophic events, (3) effects such as typical yield pillar movement that are not a safety concern but may distort needed information, and (4) placement and type of additional support or other safety intervention.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Gypsum production commenced at the beginning of the 20th century. The gypsum/anhydrite deposit has a strongly irregular contact-zone to the hanging wall. The hanging wall rock is a moraine consisting of marl intermixed with clay. This material has very poor mechanical properties. On the basis of geophysical profiles, the contact of gypsum body was localized at a depth below the surface of less than 14m. The mining method employed is multi-level room and pillar mining by means of drilling and blasting. At present three mining levels are in operation. Over time the size and orientation of the pillars was altered. Current mining dimensions are 7x7 m square pillars with at a height of 6 metres. The width of the rooms is about 8 metres. The thickness of the overburden varies from less then 20 m to 100 metres. Each of the levels is accessed from surface. The individual levels are connected through ventilation holes and ramps.

Results are presented from numerical modeling studies, conducted using a dual porosity multi-component coalbed methane simulator which has been coupled to a coupled geomechanical-fiuid flow analysis code. The model is 3-dimensional and simulates the strength and deformation properties of coal, compressibility and singleand two-phase flow properties of pore gas and water, mass transport of mixed gases in the adsorbed and free states, stressdependent permeability, and large strain deformation. Coupled mechanical deformations and fluid flow in ubiquitous jointing and discrete joints and faults are also simulated.INTRODUCTIONCoal mining under conditions of high gas pore pressure can produce the hazard of dynamic coal failure known as coal and gas outbursts. It is a dynamic phenomenon that may involve the expulsion of large volume of gas and fractured coal. Gas outburst has been a potential hazard for underground miners of gassy coal seams in many countries, from the midnineteenth century up until the present day. In Australia, the first recorded outburst happened in 1895 at Metropolitan Colliery in the Southern Coal fields of New South Wales, and many outburst events have since occurred in New South Wales and Queensland. Lives have been lost and mines have been closed, at severe cost to the community.Efforts to understand and manage the problem have been hindered by the complexity of the physical mechanisms involved, the difficulty in determining the various contributing factors and how they interact, and the need to continuously measure and monitor underground conditions as mining progresses. Nevertheless, in the last decade outburst risk has been brought under control in Australia by the introduction of in-seam gas drainage ahead of mine development and production. Under strict government regulation, drainage to meet safe gas content threshold values is carried out in all mines assessed as at risk. Mining can only proceed if the gas content at the coal face has been drained to below certain threshold values depending on gas composition. This concept is based on the work of Lama particularly with respect to the outburst problems at West Cliff Colliery (Lama, 1995).The requirement to mine at gas contents below the threshold can pose problems where drainage is difficult, and there is a need to understand the mechanics of gas and coal outbursts in order to provide a more rational approach for determining suitable threshold values and whether they can be modified under different mining conditions.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

On the basis of analyzing mechanical situation of the roadway, a mechanical model of roadway floor is established. Applying the elastic theory, the relative vertical displacement of floor strata of the roadway, the narrow pillar and the high abutment zone are calculated. The mechanical principle of floor heave of the roadway is revealed.INTRODUCTIONThe coal face with fully mechanized top-coal caving is a kind of face in which the coal face is arranged in the lower portion of a thick coal seam and the top coal above the supports is destroyed by ground pressure and drops down by its own gravity. The roadway driving along next goaf is a kind of gateway which is driven along gob of next face with a narrow chain pillar of 3-5 meters wide. This is a new technique of gateway arrangement. The mechanical situation of the roadway is different from that of average gateway. On one side of the roadway is the relative integrated coal seam (hereafter 'integrated coal') and on the other side is the narrow pillar in which plastic deformation has occurred.The high abutment pressure zone on the integrated coal beside the roadway will form due to superposition of the advancing abutment pressure in front of working face and the concentration stress of the gob side in the course of extraction. The stress on the integrated coal is much greater than that on any side of the average gateway. Intensive heaves often occur in these roadways. However, the mechanism of floor heave of the roadway is different fi'om that of the average gateway. In order to control the floor heaves efficiently, it is necessary to study the mechanical principal of floor heave of the roadway.According to the key stratum theory and movement pattern of the overlying strata on gob side of coal face with fully mechanized top-coal caving, the main stratum will fracture and form an articulated beam on gob side after next face is pushed forward, which is called 'big structure'. The side concentration stress will form on the coal seam of working face. Meanwhile, the stress-reducing zone of the gob side will form, roadway will be driven in the zone (Figure 1)Because of the coal seam along the next gob subjected to given deformation of the big structure, the fracture and plastic zone of 2-4 meters wide will form at the edge of coal seam before driving roadway. The width of chain pillar is only 3-5 meters, therefor the chain pillar will basically be in plastic status after the roadway is driven.In the course of extraction, the stress equilibrium of the big structure will be disturbed by advancing abutment pressure, whose block B will be rotaries again, the narrow pillar will wholly be in fracture status, its load-beating capacity will be further reduced. Meanwhile, because of superposition of the advancing abutment pressure and the concentration stress of the gob side on integrated coal beside the roadway, the stress on the integrated coal will increase.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The supporting of high-strength and big-percentage elongation bolt bonded with resin grout can increase the residual strength of rock, and maintain this kind roadway. Ended with an engineering instance, a new kind of successful supporting technique is put forward.In china, the supporting technology of the road driven along next goal in middle-thick coal seam has become a mature technology. As far as the thick coal seam is concerned, the top gate for fully-mechanized top coal caving face usually retains a barrier for supporting roadway. With increasing of the mining depth, it is still difficult to keep the stability of roadway by retaining a barrier with the width of 10?'-The theory research imply that the bolting support can improve the peak strength and the residual strength of surrounding rock, as well as the capacity of bearing load. The stability of the road driven along next goaf in fully-mechanized top coal caving face can be realized when the narrow pillar is designed and the bolting is adopted. Obviously it is superior to the ones supported by barrier or framed timber. On the basis of the stress distribution of coal-body edge and the bolting strength enhancement theory of surrounding rock, the bolting mechanism of roadway driven along goaf in fully-mechanized top coal caving face is analyzed here.1 The stress distribution of surrounding rock ofroadway driven along next goal In caving method, the big mining width results in the facts that the gob can't be filled with the waste; main roof will rotating-submerge and break off on the edge of the gob; the bearing stress transfer to the coal body. During this procedure, the edge of coal-body is destroyed and a fracture zone is formed with a certain thickness. At the same time, the decreasing stress zone is formed on the edge of the coal-body within a certain range(usually 0 ? 7 meters). Usually, the crossheading is driven along the floor. With a small strength, the roof is coal seam, in which the parting softens the integrity of the top coal and tempt the breakage of the top coal. Under the condition of retaining the small pillar and driving roadway along the goal, the surrounding rock, which crushed by the action of the lateral abutment pressure of the gob, has a small load-carrying ability. Because of the small stress, it is easy to maintain the roadway before the affection of the preceding abutment pressure of the face. But the affection of the preceding and lateral abutment pressure will insult in the facts that the pillar is compressed and crushed. The roof is cracked once again; the crush zone and the plastic zone are developed rapidly. The load-carrying ability of surrounding rock, above all the small pillar, is decreased faster than before, so the pressure and deformation of roadway increase rapidly. It is difficult to maintain the roadway driven along the goal in fully-mechanized top caving face in the period in which the roadway is affected by the preceding abutment stress of coal face.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The approach makes use of drill monitoring data, which provides data throughout the rock mass to be blasted and is therefore superior to traditional data-gathering methods such as diamond core or field sampling. The approach also makes use of the Split image processing software for assessing post-blast fragmentation and the crushability and grindability of the ore. Finally the approach makes use of the explosive energy per unit volume of rock. These three types of data are collected and analyzed on a hole-by-hole basis, giving 50 or more data points for each blast. These data points form the basis for a statistical correlation between in-situ conditions, blasting parameters, and the resulting fragmentation size and strength. At a specific mine, the database is continually updated as mining progresses, resulting in an evolving and increasingly accurate model with time. Some sample results from the Phelps Dodge Sierrita mine are presented.INTRODUCTIONOne of the fundamental requirements for being able to optimize blasting is the ability to predict fragmentation. An accurate blast fragmentation model allows a mine to adjust the fragmentation size for different downstream processes (mill processing rs. leach, for instance), and to make real time adjustments in blasting parameters to account for changes in rock mass characteristics (hardness, fracture density, fracture orientation, etc.). A number of blast fragmentation models have been developed in the past 40 years such as the Kuz-Ram model (Cunningham, 1983). Fragmentation models have a lim-ited usefulness at the present time because:1) The input parameters are not the most useful for the engineer to determine and data for these parameters are not available throughout the rock mass.2) Even if the input parameters are known, the models still do not consistently predict the correct fragmentation. This is because the models capture some but not all of the important rock and blast phenomena.3) The models do not allow for &quot;tuning&quot; at a specific mine site. At the University of Arizona, studies are being conducted to improve blast fragmentation models. The Split image processing software is used for these studies (Kemeny, 1994; Kemeny et al., 1999).The Split software was originally developed at the University of Arizona, and in 1997 the technology was transferred to a newly formed company, Split Engineering. The Split software allows post-blast fragmentation to be determined on a regular basis throughout a mine, by capturing images of fragmented rock in muckpiles, on haul tracks, or from primary crusher feed or product. The resulting size distribution data can then be used to accurately assess the fragmentation associated with different parts of a shot. And in particular, this data can be used to assess and improve the accuracy of fragmentation models (Higgins, et al., 1999).Fragmentation models are also being improved by utilizing drill-monitoring data. Drill-monitoring data includes raw drilling data such as rotary torque, penetration rate, and pull down pressure, as well as calculated quantitiesuch as drilling specific energy or the Aquila blastability index (Peck and Gray, 1995). Because drill-monitoring data is available from every blast hole, it provides data throughout the rock mass to be blasted.As part of this project fragmentation studies are being conducted at the Phelps Dodge Sierrita Mine in Southern Arizona.

The paper also describes a computational study in which the model was used to perform numerical simulations of PILE DRIVER, a deeplyburied underground nuclear explosion detonated in granite at the Nevada Test Site.

The immediate operation that follows is crushing of ore before they are sent to the processing plant. These operations require considerable amount of energy and crushing is considered to be in excess in the energy budget as it is a secondary sizing (after primmy fi'agrmntation resulted by blasting) of ore as required by processing. To improve energy efficiency, particularly of crushing, it is very important to understand the behavior of rock under cyclic loading as it experiences one complete cycle of loading-unloading during blasting and another during crushing. This paper investigates the rock behavior under cyclic loading and presentsome pre 'hminav] data fi'om laboratory experiments on Basalt samples.INTRODUCTIONMining is one of the most energy intensive industries as classified by the Department of Energy. The most important unit operation in mining i.e. the fragmentation of rock mass is done by blasting. In the downstream processes, the rock f?agments resulted from blasting are crushed for efficient processing operations. Both of these processes are extremely energy intensive and need to be looked at to achieve an overall reduction in energy consumption in this energy intensive industry.In both the occasions, rock is subjected to enormous loading and subsequent unloading to achieve the desired fragmentation during blasting or the desired size distribution during crushing. The previous studies point out a typical behavior of rock when rock is subjected to cyclic loading. Since rock is not a perfectly elastic material, it tends to retain a portion of the total deformation caused by the loading cycle when it is unloaded completely. So in a typical stressstrain curve of a loading-unloading cycle, the unloading path is always different than the loading path and it intersects the strain axis at a different point indicating retention of the portion of the total deformation caused by the loading.This paper discusses some preliminary studies of this typical behavior of rock under cyclic loading and conceptualizes its utilization in reducing the energy consumption particularly during rock crushing that is considered as the secondary sizing procedure in the downstream processes.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The gases contain toxic fumes such as carbon monoxide. If explosives are detonated in the rock below groundwater level, gas bubbles containing toxic fumes can form in the groundwater and stay trapped in the groundwater for many days. We discuss the mechanism that forms and traps gas bubbles. Groundwater flow can transport gas bubbles laterally and allow toxic fumes to vent into the atmosphere a significant distlmce from the blast. This may cause a health risk to workers or inhabitants of buildings near a blast. The gas trapping and gas migration mechanisms are supported by measurements from a constmction case where toxic fumes migrated laterally below ground. We discuss the construction conditions and subsurface conditions that are likely to allow the formation of gas bubbles and the subsurface migration of the gas bubbles that contain toxic fumes. We recommend some simple changes to blasting and construction procedures that can reduce the risk of subsurface migration of toxic fumes.INTRODUCTIONExplosives detonated in a surface construction blast produce smoke, which is usually seen immediately after the blast. Smoke is generally composed of water vapor, solid products of combustion, and other gases including toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. If the conditions are favorable, toxic fumes can dissipate rapidly after a surface construction blast. However, disappearance of the visible components of blast smoke is not sufficient to indicate that the toxic fumes have dissipated, because some toxic fumes such as carbon monoxide are colorless and odorless. During detonation, gas bubbles containing toxic fumes can also form below ground. Migrating gas bubbles in the groundwater can transport toxic fumes. We believe this was a previously unrecognized hazard. Toxic levels can develop in the atmosphere at the blast site or some distance from the blast site when the gas bubbles burst and the gas vents from below ground.

Experience with pillar mining that began in 1988 verified the earlier forecast of stability. Mining of the remaining central portion of the original pillar began in early 1995. A &quot;cave&quot; occurred in 1996 that led to a temporary cessation of pillar mining; pillar mining began anew in 1997 and continued for a short period. A relatively small portion of the central pillar remains. Previous pillar mining on north and south sides of the central pillar and mining between the central pillar and the Ross Shaft as well as top and bottom sill development have isolated the ore remaining. Thus, one intuitively expects little effect of final mining on the Ross Shaft. Results of the present study confirm this expectation and show very little change in shaft stability as a consequence of mining the ore remaining in the central portion of the original shaft pillar. Comparisons of three-dimensional finite element model displacements with borehole extensometer measurements that began in June, 1944, reinforce this conclusion.BACKGROUNDThe Spokane Research Laboratory, Homestake Mining Company and the University of Utah have been engaged in cooperative rock mechanics research for many years with the goal of improving safety, stability and efficiency. Studies include pillar analyses in vertical crater retreat mining, comparisons of conventional and &quot;bird-cage&quot; cable bolting and shaft pillar mechanics. Laboratory testing for rock properties, determinations of stress in situ, finite element simulations of mining sequences and numerous borehole extensometer measurements of rock mass displacements were done in each study.As in previous shaft pillar analyses (Pariseau and others, 1995, 1996), the main rock types considered are the Poorman, Homestake and Ellison formations. Each is considered anisotropic (orthotropic) and has nine elastic moduli (three Yomag's moduli, three shear moduli, three Poisson's ratios) and nine strengths (three maconfined compressive, three tensile and three shear strengths). Principal material directions are down foliation dip, parallel to strike and perpendicular to foliation. These properties were originally determined in an extensive suite of laboratory tests. Subsequent comparisons between finite element model displacements with mine extensometer measurements led to scale factors of 0.25 and 0.50 for elastic moduli and strengths, respectively. The present study uses elastic moduli and strengths that are also 0.25 and 0.50.The present study differs from past analyses (c.a. 1990) in two ways. First, the computer code UTAH3 was modified to produce a more accurate anisotropic factor of safety and to execute faster. UTAH3 is an elastic-plastic finite element program that uses associated flow rules; Drucker-Prager and anisotropic quadratic yield criteria are available. Hydro-mechanical coupling and viscoplastic versions exist, but the mine is dry and no time-dependency was considered in this study. Equation solving is by line iteration using a tangent stiffness that is updated after each load increment. Second, the mining sequence was modified to more accurately reflect actual pillar mining. This latter modification was done following discussions with Homestake personnel in May, 2000. Earlier forecasts of shaft pillar stability were based, in part, on assumed pillar mining plans.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The characterization approach is described and the distributions of the data are related to reliability requirements for underground production design. The conclusions from the characterization approach and the resulting recommendations are compared to the mining experience.INTRODUCTIONThis paper describes the geotechnical characterization and mine structural design used for underground mining at the Jerritt Canyon Joint Venture (JCJV) Murray Mine, located approximately 80 km north of Elko, Nevada, USA, in the Independence Mountains. The JCJV is an operating joint venture between Anglogold (Jerritt Canyon) Corporation and Meridian Gold.Beginning in 1993, mining at Jerritt Canyon began a transition from open pits to underground mines. The first significant underground mining was conducted in the West Generator Mine, developed from the bottom of the West Generator Pit, in a small deposit whose extraction would require an uneconomic lay-back of the existing pit wall. Rock mass quality at West Generator allowed the use of a sublevel stoping mining method with cemented rockfill. Successful application of the sublevel stoping mining method at West Generator and its relatively favorable cost made it the primary candidate at the Murray Mine, which was located in the same rocks approximately 0.5 km away.Rock mass characterization data was generated from core drilling of the Murray ore body over a several-year period preceding the initial underground mining at West Generator. The drilling data was augmented by rock mass conditions exposed by limited development mining at the Murray Mine and from exposed rock mass conditions in the West Generator underground mine. Evaluation of core data from 16 core holes and mapping of early exposures in development headings were undertaken to confirm the suitability of the proposed mining method. Three additional core holes were drilled in 1994, specifically for structural confirmation of the data from earlier drilling. The three new Murray data sources were consistent and suggested that substantially lower rock mass quality and higher variability existed in much of the Murray ore body. Reductions in stope spans and adjustments in extraction/backfilling sequences would be required for application of sublevel stoping. Alternatively, a drit?-and-fill mining method would provide a fallback strategy.Design recommendations were based on rock mass quality data distributions and were made to insure high levels of reliability in the structural stability of production excavations. High levels of reliability were required because of the direct access mining method. Probability distributions of the corebased geotechnical parameters rock quality designation (RQD), rock mass rating (RMR), Q, and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) were developed from the data and used with empirical design methods (Barton et al. 1974, Mathews et al. 1980, Potvin 1988). The data distributions and direct comparison with conditions at the Cannon (Brechtel et al. 1987) and West Generator underground mines were used for mining method evaluation and estimates of ground support requirements.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

A case study from the Bousquet mine operation is presented. Adjacent primary and secondary stopes, situated at 1100 meter depth, were studied to assess stress-induced yield of ore zone and hanging-wall rock, using brittle Hoek-Brown parameters, compared against measured stope blast vibration attenuation andmined stope profiles.INTRODUCTIONIn a global competitive market, there is pressure on mines to reduce costs. One approach to reducing mine costs is in ore dilution reduction. Dilution has a direct and large influence on the cost of a stope, and ultimately on the profitability of a mining operation. Consequently, methods of controlling factors in the design process, which result in dilution reduction should go a long way to increase the overall profitability of a mine.The Bousquet deposit is a lens of massive sulphide and associated disseminated breccia and stringer sulphides, located approximately 50 km east of Rouyn-Noranda, Qutbec. The orebody is hosted within a series of volcanic rocks, primarily schists of varying quality. The main massive pyrite lens extends from 180 meters below surface and is open at depth. The orebody strikes east-west and dips steeply (80 degrees) to the south.The Bousquet property is situated in the Abitibi region of northwest Quebec, in the southern part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The orebody follows an east-west regional structural trend, dipping steeply south in a tabular form, shown in Figures 1 and 2 and is accessed by a shaft, driven to a depth of 1245 meters on the footwall side of the orebody.Rock mass conditions are controlled extensively by the geological history, with the dominant schistose fabric controlling the behaviour of wall rocks in all underground excavations. The host rock mass is strongly schistose, quartz-mica schist.The schistocity contains sericite and acts as a dominant low friction angle weakness plane in the rock mass. Schistocity planes form platy blocks up[Figure 1 is available in the full paper]to approximately 50 mm in thickness.

The project involves identifying potential ground control problems and exploring various methods to model the behavior of the rock.The primary objectives are to improve safety for miners working underground, and to develop a modeling system that will facilitate optimum support design. The work presented here contains selected results of the preliminary stage of the project; this paper is not meant to serve as an in-depth case study but rather as an example of the application of a general methodology which can be used to identify the need for discrete element modeling.The Stillwater Mine has been in operation for 15 years. At the current time, development consists of more than 5 miles of underground excavations, and annual production is approximately 650,000 tons of ore (anonymous, 2001).The first stage of the numerical modeling project, the preliminary modeling stage, consisted of two parts. First, numerical models based on continuum approaches, finite element and finite difference methods, were used to calculate the stresses and deformations in the rock mass, and determine the overall response to the planned excavations at one specific site within the mine. The results indicated that the discontinuities can in fact control the behavior of the rock, and are a crucial component of the numerical model. The data collection system at the mine has subsequently been adjusted to provide more information regarding the orientation and spacing of the rock joints.The second part of the preliminary modeling stage involved developing a geomechanical numerical model using discrete element methods to characterize the behavior of the rock. Discrete element methods were developed specifically to model the behavior of discontinuous materials like jointed rock masses and therefore provide more accurate results than continuum-based methods. In this preliminary discontinuum phase, a parametric study of possible underground conditions at the specific site was conducted to examine the potential range of responses. These predictions will later be compared to the actual rock mass behavior. The site conditions and the details and results of the preliminary modeling stage of the research project are presented in the following sections. This is followed by a comparison of the results with a rough analytical solution, and a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the numerical methods employed.Many numerical modeling parametric studies have previously been conducted for mining-related applications.

The study aimed at establishing the effect of stope geometry and stope wall roughness on sillmat strength behaviour, when exposed by undercut mining. The results of the modeling techniques suggest that, for stopes with smooth wall rock conditions, sillmat failure is driven by the fill self-weight and has minimum dependency on the fill binder content. For stopes with rough wall rock conditions, however, wall roughness contributesignificantly to the stability of the sillmat during underfill mining. This study indicates that the stability of paste fill sillmats can be designed with confidence using a combination of the three modeling techniques.INTRODUCTIONSillmats are structural elements upon which the safety and economics of overhead mining in steeply dipping ore zones of moderate width, during overhand cut-and-fill mining, underfill mining or sill pillar mining, depend. Generally, sillmats are used to support uncemented or low cement content backfill. Conventional sillmats are cast from cemented sand backfill materials, often undedain by a timber mat; these structures have to be selfsupporting when exposed by undercut mining. Improper design would result in failure of the fill mass, and extensive economic losses associated with loss of production and ore dilution, as well as in safety problems. Sillmat, in this study, refers to the entire cemented paste fill column in the stope, and which will eventually be undercut by mining.In this paper, centrifuge model studies were combined with analytical and numerical modeling analysis to provide views into the behavior and potential failure modes of mine paste backfill sillmats. Centrifuge modeling was the primary tool used not only to dynamically test sillmat performance on a time-dependent basis but also to accommodate the three-dimensional aspects of the problem. Analytical modeling was carded out using limiting equilibrium analysis, based on a method introduced by Mitchell and Roettger (1989). Numerical modeling was carded out using FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua), a powerful two-dimensional elastic plastic-finite difference code.The modeling study incorporated the effect of stope geometry and stope wall roughness on sillmat behaviour and stability performance. Models were prepared to simulate two different stope conditions; stopes 3 m wide, 15 m long, and 30 m high, typical of mining Block 4 of the Battle Mountain GoldGolden Giant Mine, and stopes 5-7.5 m wide, 15 m long, and 40 m high, typical of Block 5. In all cases the stope walls were inclined at 75 &oslash; and smooth, medium-rough and rough rock wall conditions were established for simulating typical boundary modes. Wall closure effects associated with such narrow stopes, surcharge loading and blasting effects were not considered in the study. Paste fill was prepared at 80% pulp density using unclassified tailings mixed with Type 10 Normal Portland cement (NPC) and Type C fly ash (FA). All recipes were prepared at 7% binder content and cured at 14, 28 and 56 days.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Based on the risk assessment resuits, recommendations are given on the risk assessment method and development of downtown Tangshah.INTRODUCTIONTangshan is an important industrial city in China. In 1978 a catastrophic earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.8, rocked this city and took the lives of a quaaer of a million people. This earthquake also brought many unforeseen problems subsequently to Tangshah. Karst collapses are one of the unforeseen problems. From 1979 to 1994, 18 confirmed or possible karst collapses occurred with a total affected area of nearly 20 km 2.A karst collapse usually originates from the loss of stability of a hidden karst cave in a fragmented rock mass. Since karst caves are usually covered by Quaternary sediments, they are difficult to locate and their stability difficult to assess.

The method is to determine profil e volume--the volume calculated by determining the profile of the top surface-of the pile near a drawpoint, monitor the volume drawn, and compare the two volumes in real time to detecthe formation of voids. If void formation could be detected early, a warning could alert workers of hazardous conditions. Six numerical experiments were run to simulate various conditions. Results show that when no material was added to the pile, voids could be detected by comparing real-time curves of volume scanned and volume drawn. Slopes and differences of the curves were used to detect a void. When material flowed into the area from a stacker tube, void detection was difficult. Prior knowledge of flow curve slopes and an additional indicator of flow from a stacker tube may be necessary to detect voids. An indicator of the presence of a bulldozer in the area is necessary to help identify material added to the pile.INTRODUCTIONThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued Program Information Bulletin P99-1 on January 13, 1999, to alert the coal mining industry about hazards associated with coal surge piles and the large number of fatalities associated with surge pile accidents since 1980 (17 fatalities from 13 accidents). Twelve of these 13 accidents occurred when a void formed in the surge pile during drawdown and collapsed. Ten of the victims were bulldozer operators.Iverson and others (2001) performed a fault-tree analysis .to determine the most probable root cause(s) of bulldozers falling into voids. Although several conditions must be present before a bulldozer can fall into a void, two necessary conditions are the formation of a void and the presence of a bulldozer over the draw cone area. Bulldozers must work near draw cones, and rules and safeguards must be in place to prevent operators from driving bulldozers over draw cones. However, if a void could be detected early on, operators could be warned to stay far away from feeder areas until the bridge over a void collapses.While the risk of being drawn into a cone during drawdown operations is significant, once personnel or equipment are engulfed, rescue operations may be even more hazardous. Rescue operations involve sending a worker down into the cone in a suspended basket or cherry picker or cutting a path into the cone from the side, both processes that send a second equipment operator beneath hazardous slopes or cut walls.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

The information populating the database is extracted from the inquiry reports compiled by the inspectorate of the Department of Minerals and Energy. Also included in the database is the annual production, expressed as square metres mined, for each of the reefs mined. The production data is used as a normalizing factor in the analysis of the accident statistics. Various types of analysis of the data are performed with the objectives, inter alia of determining trends, with time, on the occurrence of rock related accidents; and the influence of mining depth on the ratio of rockburst to rockfall accidents, beating in mind the increase in mining induced seismicity with depth. An additional parameter extracted from the database, and important in the design of support, is the distribution of fall-out thicknesses in the different ground control districts. The locations in the mines, where accidents are most likely to occur, are quantified in order to highlight areas of concern and where research effort should be concentrated. Analysis is also carded out to determine the relative risk of mining the different reefs, which have different geootechnical conditions. This also focuses attention on where improved mining practice and research effort are required. The results of these analyses are presented and their significance is discussed.INTRODUCTIONGold mining in the Witwatersrand Basin occurs on large tabular ore bodies, many several hundred square kilometres in extent, at depths below surface ranging from a few hundred metres to 3700 m. The average number of people required underground daily to carry out this mining was approximately 400 000 for the period under review. Of serious concern is the high number of accidents that occur. To obtain a better understanding of the causes and factors influencing the accidents, a rock-related, fatal accident database was established in 1993 by CSIR: Division of Mining Technology as part of a SIMRAC research project (Roberts, 1997). The database contains detailed information of all rockfall and rockburst fatal accidents since 1990, and to date encompasses 1950 entries. The database is updated annually from information extracted from the accident inquiry reports compiled by the inspectorate of the Department of Minerals and Energy. The production information is obtained from the mines on a shaft-by-shaft and reef-by-reef basis for each year.In order to analyze the database in a meaningful way, the annual number of fatalities needs to be normalized with respect to production data. The normalizing parameter used for this purpose is square metres mined on the tabular reefs and is a direct measure of the new hangingwall exposed that has to be supported and has a potential to fall. The fatality data is normalized to a 'rate' expressed as fatalities per million square metres mined. Normalizing the fatality data with square metres mined nullifies the effect of varying production levels during the period under review and for different reefs. The results of various analyses are presented but emphasis is placed on a relative new investigation, which compares the accident rates for different reefs.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Rocksalt subjected to low strain rates demonstrates viscoplastic behavior. Under higher strain rates rocksalt shows brittle behavior. In the latter case, micro fractures develop at the grain scale and evolve into visible fractures.Extensive observations and measurements from the underground excavations at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), together with a reliable finite elementool, can be used to study the fracture and failure of rocksalt. The incorporation of the failure process into the computer models results in a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of the behavior of the rock mass, which, in turn, enhances mine safety and economics. To this end, the formulation of an elasto-plastic-crccp material model and its implementation in the finite element program ADINA arc presented.

Hardy(Sandia National Laboratories),,,,,,ARMA-01-0489,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,":Measurements of elastic wave velocities parallel and perpendicular to the rib (wall) of a drift at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) were made to map out the extent of the zone disturbed by the excavation and time-dependent processes in the 10+ years since the drift was excavated. Understanding the development of the Disturbed Rock Zone (DRZ) is relevanto the eventual sealing of the WIPP. A DRZ was found that extended in as much as two meters from the drift, with the extent being a function of distance from the back and floor of the drift. Observedecreases in elastic wave velocity near the free surface exceeded 20%, implying highinstantaneous and/or time-dependent damage.INTRODUCTIONThere is a need to understand the spatial and temporal development of the disturbed rock zone (DRZ) around openings at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Possible leakage paths around seals, effects on closure rates and safety issues related to deterioration of the salt mechanical properties are issues affected by the DRZ. A drift constructed about 10 years ago as an access to Room Q provided an opportunity to conduct geophysical investigations of the damage that has developed in the salt for a 2 dimensional configuration removed from the disturbances of other excavations. As part of a suite of measurements designed to study the hydrological and mechanical properties of the salt around the drift, an array of ultrasonic transducer emplacement holes was drilled in the rib to a depth of about 6 meters. The mature DRZ is the macroscopic manifestation of grain-scale and larger cracks formed as a result of the instantaneous shear stress around the newly-created opening, and as a result of creep-related failures over a period of years. Velocity of elastic waves in the salt is a function of crack density. The design of the hole array and the transducer assemblies allows the measurement of elastic wave velocities along vertical and horizontal paths tangential to the drift ribs and, within the same hole, perpendicular to the rib. Orthogonal paths are necessary in order to detect the anisotropy of the cracking in the DRZ. Measurements were done using ?Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC04-94A18500. paths in the rib near the back, floor and mid-height of the rib, allowing us to detecthe effect of the varying stress state on the development of the DRZ in theselocations.Previous work at the WIPP, (Munson et al., 1995, Holcomb, 1999, and Hardy and Holcomb, 2000) delineated the DRZ as a function of depth around a vertical shaft and near a concrete seal. Using results published by Brodsky (1990, 1995), changes in velocity can be related to the damage, due to microcracking, required to produce the observed changes. The significance of the results lies in the length of time the DRZ has had to develop (approximately 10 years), the geometrical simplicity of the drift which eases the task of relating the results to models, and the hydrological measurements to be made in conjunction with the velocity and attenuation measurements.",,American Rock Mechanics Association

Carrasco(Westinghouse Government Environmental Services LLC)",,,,,,ARMA-01-0497,"DC Rocks 2001, The 38th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics (USRMS), 7-10 July, Washington, D.C.",2001,":The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (W[PP), a United States Department of Energy underground nuclear waste disposal facility, commenced disposal operations over one year ago. The radioactivity of most of the waste will be low enough to allow storage in steel drumstacked in the underground openings at WIPP. Some of the waste will have higher radioactivity and will require storage in horizontal boreholes drilled in the walls of the excavations. This paper investigates the geomechanical effects of the horizontal boreholes on the stability of the WIPP underground excavations.INTRODUCTIONAn underground excavation is considered physically stable if all activities for which the opening was intended can safely be completed in that opening without requiting measures beyond standard ground control and maintenance. A room may remain usable, even though rock conditions have significantly deteriorated around it, if adequate ground support has been installed and maintained. For a waste disposal panel, the time that the excavations in the panel must remain stable is the time between mining and panel closure. During this time the rooms are closely monitored to continually assesstability and ensure safe working conditions. After a panel is closed, stability is no longer a concern because no personnel shall enter the panel. This paper investigates the effeet of remotely handled (RH) waste disposal boreholes on short-term (zero to 7.5 year) room stability, and determines whether the presence of the RH boreholes and waste could cause the disposal rooms to become unstable before panel closure. The work presented here was completed for the United States Department of Energy (DOE), which was authorized by Public Law 96-164 to provide a research and development facility for demonstrating the safe permanent disposal of transuranic (TRU) wastes f?om national defense activities and programs of the United States exempted f?om regulations by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), located in southeastern New Mexico near Carlsbad, was construeted to determine the efficacy of an underground repository for disposal of TRU wastes located 650 meters deep in a bedded halite formation. The WIPP will dispose of waste in eight panels of seven rooms each (Figure 1). The rooms are about 90 meters long, 10 meters wide, and four meters high. They are separated by 30 meter wide pillars. The panels are separated by 60 meter wide barrier pillars. Figure 1. WIPP disposal area layout. The proposed RH borehole layout consists of 0.76-meter diameter boreholes drilled horizontally into the ribs about 1.6 meters above the floor. The boreholes are spaced 2.44 meters apart center to center and are 5.2 meters deep.",,American Rock Mechanics Association
